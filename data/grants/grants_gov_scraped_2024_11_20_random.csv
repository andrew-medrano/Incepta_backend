Participants in the BPN are responsible for conducting all studies that involve disease- or target-specific assays, models, and other research tools and receive funding for all activities to be conducted in their own laboratories. In addition, applicants will collaborate with NIH-funded consultants and can augment their project with NIH contract research organizations (CROs) that specialize in medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, formulations development, chemical synthesis including under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and Phase I clinical testing. Projects can enter either at the Discovery stage, to optimize promising hit compounds through medicinal chemistry to the Development stage, to advance a single development candidate through Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling toxicology studies and phase I clinical testing. Alternatively, projects can enter at the Development stage and progress in a shorter period to IND enabling toxicology studies and phase I clinical testing. BPN awardee Institutions retain their assignment of IP rights and gain assignment of IP rights from the BPN contractors (and thereby control the patent prosecution and licensing negotiations) for drug candidates developed in this program."

Improving access to safe drinking water,USAID-LIB,forecasted,03/16/2021,,https://www.grants.gov/search-results-detail/332142,720669-21-RFI-00001-WA,"Other (see text field entitled ""Explanation of Other Category of Funding Activity"" for clarification)","Mar 16, 2021",,"Apr 06, 2021",,,,"THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary, and the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government. Development Problem Statement USAID has considerable experience working on water infrastructure in urban and peri-urban settings such as Montserrado and Margibi, where the cost-effectiveness of reaching people in more densely-populated areas is greater. Although the percentage of the population that already has access to basic water services in the two counties is fairly high, it is estimated that the counties are home to over 100,000 people who are still using unimproved water sources. This activity would seek to sustainably eliminate the use of surface water and unimproved water sources in Montserrado and Margibi, moving everyone to at least a basic level of water service. To do so, the activity would address key systems challenges affecting water service delivery, including poor governance and financial management of water systems, lack of financing for water, lack of community involvement in designing and managing local water systems, and insufficient customer demand for basic water services, which have limited the sustainability of water investments in the past.
