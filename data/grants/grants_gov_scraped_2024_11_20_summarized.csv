To do so, the activity would address key systems challenges affecting water service delivery, including poor governance and financial management of water systems, lack of financing for water, lack of community involvement in designing and managing local water systems, and insufficient customer demand for basic water services, which have limited the sustainability of water investments in the past.

It offers multiple tracks to support various aspects of this educational enhancement.

**Research Objectives:** The program seeks to achieve specific short-term goals in undergraduate STEM education, develop innovative approaches to increase participation and success among underrepresented groups, especially African Americans, and fund STEM faculty to initiate research. Additionally, it aims to assess and implement comprehensive strategies for increasing the number of degrees awarded in STEM fields.

**Expected Outcomes:** The anticipated outcomes include improved quality and accessibility of STEM education at HBCUs, increased participation of underrepresented groups in STEM, faculty engagement in research activities, and the establishment of research centers focused on broadening participation in STEM education.

**Application Considerations:** Information on application requirements, deadlines, and specific eligibility criteria is not provided.","HBCU-UP offers awards to enhance STEM undergraduate education and research at Historically Black Colleges and Universities through Targeted Infusion Projects (TIP) and Research on Broadening Participation in STEM projects (BPR). TIP focuses on achieving short-term goals for improving STEM education, while BPR supports research to develop and study new theories for broadening participation in STEM fields."
