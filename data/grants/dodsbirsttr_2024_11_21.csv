Currently, it takes units at the Battalion (BN) echelon several hours to use the Military Decision-Making Process (MDMP) to generate and vet CoA options. Leveraging state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) algorithms will speed up this process by an order of magnitude, allowing systematic replanning during the execution phase of operations. This will improve mission success and reduce risk to force in combat operations. It will also enable the mobile, distributed command post concept.\n\nDESCRIPTION: Several approaches to CoA generation for military applications currently exist. These methods leverage large language models (LLM) applied to Doctrine or deep learning/hierarchical modeling applied to wargaming. Each existing LLM approach is inadequate for CoA generation at BN due to lack of proper consideration of Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for both friendly and enemy forces. The existing learned/hierarchical approaches that depend on wargaming are also inadequate due to a lack of fully automated wargaming capability at the BN echelon and/or due to CoA outcomes that are not aligned with best practices (TTPs and SOPs).Proposals submitted under this topic will leverage state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches to create a CoA recommendation module narrowly tailored to the BN echelon. This capability will expand to encompass higher echelons in later phases.\n\nPHASE 1: This topic is only accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance. Understand relevant scenarios and data sources. Design development strategy. Conduct feasibility study. Develop and demonstrate proof-of-concept CoA recommendation algorithm.\n\nPHASE 2: Develop and train CoA recommendation agent and support integration into appropriate mission command system. Make interim algorithm deliveries biannually for independent evaluation. Deliver final algorithm, supporting software, documentation and algorithm performance report.\n\nPHASE 3 DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Automated CoA generation has wide applicability to autonomous systems in industries such as robotics, self-driving automobiles, security, and gaming. Financial Services & Personal Finance: Aides in professional, financial services planning and “gamming” out as well as planning for things like retirement and estates.  Retail and Supply Chain: These models can help ensure that supply chains aren’t strained for retail products (can also work for B2B solutions).  Construction & Manufacturing: AI models can assist in project planning and forecast unforeseen problems Healthcare: Aides in personal healthcare forecasting and preventative medicine  \n"

The proposed LLM will assist “blue” and adversarial assessment teams with vulnerability identification and exploitation modeling. Outputs from the LLM will be utilized as inputs to US Army DEVCOM AvMC “blue” team activities and inputs to designated DoD red teams. The LLM prototype will identify vulnerabilities and create proof-of-concept exploits in a threat intelligence-informed environment.\n\nDESCRIPTION: The primary problem this topic addresses is the growing complexity of traditional and AI/ML-based cybersecurity threats to DoD weapon systems, increasingly connected and automated weapon systems architectures, and the need for advanced tools to enhance development-phase cyber resiliency efforts and exploit modeling.  This topic is essential because it will improve US DoD aviation and missile platforms' resilience, survivability, and lethality through the enhanced identification and exploitation modeling of system vulnerabilities during system development. This will achieve significant impact in the most cost-effective phase of the system lifecycle.  The proposed approach leverages state-of-the-art LLMs to develop a specialized tool for system security engineering risk reduction efforts (blue team and AAMCATs) and provides critical exploitation inputs to DoD-approved red team operations. This topic innovates on existing technology by fine-tuning a foundational LLM built to analyze complex weapon system codebases, identify vulnerabilities, and generate proof-of-concept exploits. This approach combines natural language processing and code analysis capabilities, creating a powerful tool that surpasses current manual and automated analysis methods. The proposed LLM will be trained on the large amounts of relevant data available to DEVCOM AvMC including code, network traffic, static and dynamic analysis results, external software code bases and malicious software examples, and threat intelligence from partner US Government organizations. The LLM will be integrated with AvMC software and hardware integration labs to provide further tuning and address the issue of run-time analysis when software code is unavailable to the cyber resiliency team.\n\nPHASE 1: This topic is only accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance. Technical Feasibility Study of the proposed LLM including data and technical requirements, cost, and acquisition plans/schedule. The final Study whitepaper milestone is due six months after the start of the project. Interim milestones include Data Identification, Sufficiency, and Access (2 months), Weapon System Prototype Identification (3 months), Interim Model Selection/Strategy (4 months), and Resource Identification (5 months).\n\nPHASE 2: Prototype-scale model training and deployment in a controlled environment that identifies defined vulnerabilities and generates representative proof of concept exploits of a selected aviation or missile weapon system (24 months). Interim milestones will validate or inform the project development team to include a Concept Review in month 6 (design concept approval), a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) in month 10 (review of preliminary design and datasets), an Intermediate Design Review (IDR) in month 14 (approval to proceed to model development/training), a Training Review in month 19 (approval for full-scale training), and a Critical Design Review (CDR) at month 22 (review fully trained model/results). Monthly status reports will inform progress toward milestone and objective achievement.\n\nPHASE 3 DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Implementation of the developed LLM can be used as a resource to design systems and identify security flaws for commercial, academic, and research use cases.  The model potentially scales when trained with commercial data. Financial Services: As the biggest buyer of cybersecurity software and services, financial services and Wall Street will be a big market segment for these systems eCommerce: Protect systems that use AI/ML, like Amazon, from malicious actors Manufacturing: As digital engineering continues to proliferate, manufacturing will need AI/ML vector analysis Healthcare: Similar to the proliferation of AI in other sectors, healthcare contains very sensitive data that requires state-of-the-art AI/ML cybersecurity   Energy & Utilities: Again, similar to the above sectors, it requires AI/ML cybersecurity. \n"

Ferrimagnetic shocklines offer the potential to meet this requirement and deliver a capability which may be optimized and can scale to the required high-voltage amplitudes as well as handling pulse repetition rates on the order of 10s of kHz.  Proposed pulse sharpening solutions should offer the capability to sharpen nanosecond pulse width high-voltage impulses to generate outputs with 10%-90% rise time pulses on the order of 150 picoseconds and full width half maximums of 500 picoseconds.\n\nPHASE 1:  Establish an improved additive manufacturing process to develop compact and lightweight ferrite-based shocklines with HN connectors. Conduct an assessment of rise time and pulse width trade-offs for input incident voltage limits at a 50-Ohm transmission line. Perform a tradespace assessment of size and weight for the proposed solutions. Proposed solutions should target the following performance parameters:10%-90% rise times of 150 picosecondsFull width half maximum pulse widths of 500 picosecondsPulse sharpening of high voltage impulses with peak amplitudes greater than 100 kVs Perform an assessment of pulse repetition rate capabilities and thermal loading impacts on performance. Propose methods for improved thermal management. Conduct an analysis of the performance of planar geometrical structures compared to more complex structures which may include tapers, gradients, periodic structures, or other geometries. Propose methods for operational lifetime evaluation. This topic is accepting Direct to Phase II (DP2) proposals ONLY. Proposers interested in submitting a DP2 proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility equivalent to a Phase I project has been met. Documentation can include data, reports, specific measurements, success criteria of a prototype, etc.               \n\nPHASE 2: Develop and deliver to the government (Quantity 4) optimized ferrite loaded transmission line pulse sharpeners based on ferrimagnetic shockline technology for integration with solid-state pulse generator prototypes developed by the government that meet the performance requirements and specifications in the interface control document (ICD) supplied by the government.

To help solve electronics obsolescence issues, the DoD is seeking a US-sourced, 3.3/5v configurable logic application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). \n\nDESCRIPTION: Electronics systems are adversely impacted when integrated circuits (IC) in the bill of materials (BOM) become obsolete. Due to reduced profit margins, semiconductor manufacturers have migrated from 5v digital processes to digital processes  < 2v. Unfortunately, many DoD electronic systems require 3.3v or 5v logic. Redesign of the electronic system with a technology refresh can be prohibitive with respect to cost and schedule. A 3.3/5v configurable logic that can be adapted to various IC packages can help reduce obsolescence issues.  A 3.3/5v configurable logic ASIC  supporting both combinational and sequential logic designs and have the ability to be configured using hardware description languages Verilog and VHDL can help reduce obsolescence issues; essentially a 3.3/5v field programmable gate array (FPGA). Unfortunately, 3.3/5v FPGA's can no longer be procured.\n\nPHASE 1: Conduct a feasibility study on a proposed method for creating a 3.3/5v configurable logic ASIC that can be adapted to various IC packages. The ASIC can be a single integrated circuit running on a single voltage supply or multiple voltage supplies. The ASIC can also be a multi-chip module (MCM) with multiple voltage supplies. Whether a single IC or MCM, the ASIC can only have  a 3.3/5 volt supply voltage. If the IC or MCM requires internal voltage supplies, other than the 3.3/5 volt supply, the IC/MCM must be designed to generate other internal voltage supplies. A large percentage of the inputs and outputs shall be configurable to be either input or output. The logic inputs shall be complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and transistor-transistor logic (TTL)-level compatible. The configurable ASIC shall be characterized for 5 volt and 3.3 volt supplies, +/- 10%. The proposal shall address:  1. solutions to electronic design automation (EDA) software to program the ASIC and to assure timing closure is met via static timing analysis (STA), 2. single IC and/or MCM implementations, 3) the generation of any internal supply voltages, 4) cost estimates for production. A proof of concept of the proposed ASIC shall be performed either by simulation and/or by using commercially off the shelf (COTS) parts. The feasibility study shall address limitations of their proposed solutions and include (but not limited to): maximum operating frequency, output driver configurability, output drive capability, array size, cost, and power.\n\nPHASE 2: Build, test, and deliver a fully functional 3.3/5v configurable logic ASIC and all electronic design automation (EDA) software used to program the ASIC and perform static timing analysis (STA) based on the design developed in Phase I. Circuit and layout design reviews shall be held to ensure specification compliance and review any trade-offs.\n\nPHASE 3 DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: There is very little, if any, commercial use for this technology. However, the global defense electronics obsolescence market is expected to grow to $3.7B by 2028, and this technology can be helpful in solving many of those obsolescence issues.\n"

To help mitigate potential exposure risks, DoD entities tasked with force health protection [1] rapidly assess, often on-site, a range of sample types for potential biological threats. Current rapid on-site identification (ID) methods include sequencing [2,3] and lateral flow assays (aka dipstick tests) [4], which destroy both the sample & the organism(s), inhibiting further analysis. While sequencing costs continue to decrease and cheap lateral flow assays continue to increase in organism scope, forward operators often triage the number of sites and samples collected due to resource, personnel, and time constraints [5]. Recent advances in metasurfaces [6,7]7, optical waveguides [8], microfluidics [9], and (super)high resolution imaging [10], now suggest accurate organism ID and viability maintenance can co-occur; however, current non-destructive systems lack field utility due to their lab-centric designs [7].   This SBIR will address both the significant limitations to rapid, on-site biosurveillance in resource constrained environments and the lab-centric designs for non-destructive pathogen ID by developing human-portable, low size, weight, and power (SWaP) technology to rapidly and non-destructively ID viruses on-site and in the field. Final Phase II prototypes must be: ≤ 1 ft3; ≤ 5 lbs; and ≤ 200-Watt peak power input, with all SWaP requirements inclusive of power delivery mechanisms, software/data processing, consumables, and reagents, and should function with a wide range of simulated clinical samples (e.g., blood, saliva, nasal swabs, etc.) and contrived environmental samples (swipes/wipes, chicken rinse, etc.). Systems should non-destructively ID viruses faster than current state-of-the-art sequencing and lateral flow assays (≤ 15 min per sample, not including sample pre-processing) while maintaining viral infectivity for downstream lab-based analysis. By the end of Phase II systems should ID viruses faster than current state-of-the-art sequencing and lateral flow assays (≤ 15 min per sample), in the field sample pre-processing, if any, should be no more than 20 minutes per sample, and viral ID should be independent of cloud connectivity (e.g., database access, analysis and ID can occur on the device without cloud access). \n\nPHASE 1: This topic is soliciting Direct to Phase II (DP2) proposals only. To be considered eligible for a DP2 award proposers must demonstrate their technology can achieve the following: (1) rapidly (≤  45 minutes) identify ≥ 10 different eukaryotic viruses in monoculture across ≥ 5 viral groups (Baltimore classification), (2) differentiate ≥ 5 viruses in a mixed sample with ≥ 2 related viral strains (e.g., FluA H1N1 vs H3N2), and (3) function as a breadboard system with minimal user input. Specific data that directly supports the previous capabilities must be provided. Additionally, proposers must clearly define the testing schema that will be used to satisfy the below sensitivity, specificity, and limits of viral identification metrics. Finally, proposers must describe the developmental pathway of the existing breadboard system to the portable end of DP2 system, production scalability of the platform, potential to adapt the system to sample multiplexing (≥ 10 samples simultaneously), projected final unit cost and cost/test, and technology commercialization plans.   \n\nPHASE 2: This DP2 effort (24 months) will focus on research, development, and testing to develop a portable, in-field, rapid, easily operable viral identification technology. Specifically, performers will utilize existing systems to: (1) increase fidelity of non-destructive ID technology, (2) increase viral diversity assessed, (3) increase sample matrix complexity with simulated clinical and/or environmental samples, and (4) meet SWaP requirements for system portability. Phase II will consist of three demonstrations, including an initial (month 9), interim (month 15) and a final (month 23) demonstration to take place in the field. Technology design reviews will be held at months 3, 11, and 17, with a design lock at month 18. The final technology must demonstrate its operability by non-expert users as well as the ability to demonstrate viral infectivity of collected samples.

Determining pathogens that may contaminate products or otherwise pose a health risk requires rapid detection and identification of infectious organisms. Current methods for monitoring often require samples to be transported back to labs and/or result in the destruction of the sample leading to loss of pathogen viability. Enabling on-site testing would substantially increase the throughput for sample monitoring. Additionally, such a system would advance the US governments biological surveillance capabilities. Adoption into existing workflows for field sampling & testing is likely. \n"

The hearing followed the release of annual data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs showing that the disproportionate rate of veteran suicide is a public health crisis [2]. Although there is no single reason why veterans commit suicide, evidence suggests that stable housing, financial security, access to healthcare, addressing social isolation and loneliness, and treating the effects of trauma are important components of a comprehensive suicide prevention strategy; all of which require coordination and cooperation across families, communities, and at all levels of government.   Recent advances in AI, and specifically LMs, have the potential to help lessen the effects of social isolation/loneliness and trauma. According to a 2019 report on “Sleep and timing of death by suicide among US Veterans 2006-2015” [McCarthy, et al. 2019], the raw proportion of veteran suicides peaks between the hours of 1000 and 1200; however, the peak prevalence of suicide, after accounting for the population being awake, is between the hours of 0000 and 0300 (p < 0.00001, F = 0.88). The highest Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) is at midnight; US Veterans are eight times more likely to die by suicide than expected given the population awake (SIR = 8.17; 95% Confidence Interval = 7.45-8.94). In other words, when clinical help is likely unavailable or difficult to access, technology has the potential to provide critical assistance.    Recent advances in the field of natural language processing have allowed LMs (for example, Chat GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)) to be fine-tuned using reinforcement learning based on human feedback [3]. Prior efforts have shown that it is possible to create a highly conversational model based on 40,000 pieces of feedback [4]. Other recent research work in the field suggests promising results in prompt engineering [5], using memory-based machine learning with dramatic improvements in the LM’s ability to stay on task, and return more accurate and precise results. [6]    LM4VSP seeks to develop a clinical co-pilot based on LMs specific to the mental health subdomain, and in close collaboration with mental health subject matter experts (SMEs). The goal is for the LM4VSP clinical co-pilot to enable caregivers to offer around-the-clock assistance and accelerate their understanding and assessments and improve the effectiveness of intervention.   \n\nPHASE 1: Phase I will focus on producing a feasibility study and proof-of-concept model of the LM4VSP clinical co-pilot. The Phase I effort should include, at a minimum:  the identification and acquisition of relevant domain data, e.g., anonymized mental health, battlefield, etc.;  the identification and engagement of SMEs, e.g., mental health professionals;  identification of key trigger points and ranges of appropriate responses in collaboration with mental health SMEs;   identification of major categories of stress and trauma and best practices for their management; identification of trigger points or categories that have the highest probability of successful technology-assisted intervention;   assessment of current approaches in the use of language models to detect mental health classes; and development of a proof-of-concept model.

The Phase II effort should include, at a minimum: Identification of key metrics for evaluation of performance;  Identification of gaps and shortcomings of existing LMs and transformer-based models to be used for baseline system comparisons;  Development of a labeled dataset of anonymized mental health data;  Development of a prototype LM4VSP clinical co-pilot.

LM4VSP has the same applicability for industry/the commercial sector.  Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR program. The Phase III work will be oriented towards transition and commercialization of the developed LM4VSP prototype.

"Multi-factor Continuous Authentication for Wearable Defense Equipment (MCAWDE)","DOD","","12/04/2024","01/08/2025","https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics-app/","HR0011SB20254-03","","","","","nan","","","KEYWORDS: Internet of Things, Multi-Factor Authentication, Wearables, Cyber Security, Continuous Authentication, Privacy\n\nOBJECTIVE: The goal of Multi-factor Continuous Authentication for Wearable Defense Equipment (MCAWDE) topic is to develop and demonstrate novel, continuous, multi-factor authentication solutions for small weight and power devices.\n\nDESCRIPTION: Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices have seen unprecedented growth [1] and yet remain one of the weakest links when it comes to cybersecurity [2]. User and device authentication for battery-operated IoT devices (e.g., smartphones and wearables) is challenging due to limitations on the available energy, user interface, and processing power [3]. Over the last few years, multiple authentication techniques have been developed to address these challenges, for example, location-based authentication techniques [4] and gait-based authentication techniques [5]. However, existing techniques face challenges in terms of performance overhead, power consumption, and overall efficiency of cryptographic operations [6]. To address these challenges, DARPA seeks novel, continuous [7], multi-factor authentication [8] solutions for small weight and power devices. \n\nPHASE 1: The MCAWDE SBIR topic is soliciting Direct to Phase 2 (DP2) proposals only, which must include supporting documentation of Phase I feasibility. Phase I feasibility must be demonstrated through evidence of: a completed proof of concept/principal or basic prototype; definition and characterization of properties/capabilities desirable for DoD/government and civilian/commercial use; and capability/performance comparisons with existing state-of-the-art technologies/methodologies (competing approaches).        Entities interested in submitting a DP2 proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific/technical merit and feasibility described above has been achieved and describe the potential commercial applications. DP2 Phase I feasibility documentation should include, at a minimum:     technical reports describing results and conclusions of existing work, particularly regarding the commercial opportunity or DoD insertion opportunity, risks/mitigations, and technology assessments presentation materials and/or white papers/technical papers   test and measurement data prototype designs/models performance projections, goals, or results in various use cases; and,  documentation of related topics such as how the proposed MCAWDE solution can enable multi-factor continuous authentication for wearable defense equipment       The collection of Phase I feasibility material will verify mastery of the required content for DP2 consideration. DP2 proposers must also demonstrate knowledge, skills, and abilities in the technical areas of software engineering, cyber security, privacy, analytics, and machine learning. For detailed information on DP2 requirements and eligibility, please refer to the DoD Broad Agency Announcement and the DARPA Instructions for this topic.  \n\nPHASE 2: The goal of MCAWDE is to develop and demonstrate novel, continuous, multi-factor authentication solutions for small weight and power devices. MCAWDE continuous, multi-factor authentication techniques should employ lightweight device sensors to enable robust and efficient user and device authentication. Notional proposed techniques could incorporate gait signals (captured from inertial sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes), heart rate sensors, and stress levels based on galvanic skin response [9, 10] to name a few. Ideally, the chosen device sensors should be relevant to or easily extensible to current devices that a warfighter might use, e.g., see [11]. Proposals are encouraged to employ multiple sensing modalities to achieve robust authentication.    Because there is a clear trade-off between the frequency of sensor readings, and power and processing overhead, any proposed solutions should require little to no user interaction for authentication. Moreover, any proposed solutions should operate in real-time and allow for privacy considerations.   DP2 proposals should:     describe a proposed framework design/architecture to achieve the above stated goals   present a plan for maturation of the framework to a demonstrable prototype; and,  detail a test plan, complete with proposed quantitative metrics for the prototype performance   Phase II will culminate in a prototype demonstration using one or more compelling use cases consistent with commercial opportunities and/or insertion into a DARPA program, for example, the Open Programmable Secure 5G (OPS-5G) program [12], which aims, in part, to develop techniques and security architectures enabling security at scale across devices with widely disparate size, weight, and power.     The Phase II Option period will further mature the technology for insertion into a DoD Acquisition Program, another Federal agency, or commercialization into the private sector.    The below schedule of milestones and deliverables is provided to establish expectations and desired results/end products for the Phase II and Phase II Option period efforts.   Schedule/Milestones/Deliverables: Proposers will execute the research and development (R&D) plan as described in their proposals, including the below: proposers that anticipate involving Human Subjects Research (HSR) must comply with the approval procedures detailed at http://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/additional-baa. Proposers planning to use HSR are highly encouraged to clearly segregate research tasks from human testing tasks to allow for partial funding while internal and DoD approvals are obtained.    Every 3 months: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing: technical progress to date, tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (while this would normally report progress against the plan detailed in the proposal, it is understood that scientific discoveries, competition, and regulatory changes may all have impacts on the planned work and DARPA must be made aware of any revisions that result), planned activities, trip summaries, any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM, and updates on (if applicable) Institutional Review Board and Human Research Protection Office approvals or subject enrollment when approvals are obtained.    Every 6 months: Technical progress briefings to the DARPA PM (these briefings may take place as part of the OPS-5G program Principal Investigator meetings).   Month 24: Final architecture with documented details; a demonstration of the ability for continuous, multi-factor authentication of wearable defense equipment; documented application programming interfaces; and any other necessary documentation (e.g., commercialization plan).    Month 29 (Phase II Option period): Interim report of matured prototype performance against existing state-of-the-art technologies, documenting key technical gaps towards productization.   Month 34 (Phase II Option period): Final Phase II Option period technical report including prototype performance against existing state-of-the-art technologies, including quantitative metrics for assessment.  \n\nPHASE 3 DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: MCAWDE has potential applications across the DoD/government and commercially. For DoD/government, successful MCAWDE approaches are well-suited for integration into warfighter wearable devices, such as smartwatches, and tactical defense equipment. MCAWDE has the same applicability for the commercial sector.

MCAWDE solutions will support national efforts to help secure government, commercial, and personal IoT devices. Results of MCAWDE are intended to improve understanding of the risks associated with the large threat surface created by IoT devices, across government and industry. \n"

The final deliverable shall be a formal report, to include relevant material testing and demonstrations, which defines how the Small Business can build and test the desired material or material configuration and detailed plans (estimated costs, manufacturing considerations, material sourcing plan, plans for independent material assessments & measurements, etc.) to produce them in limited quantities if awarded the Phase II effort.\n\nPHASE 2: Development of prototypes based on Phase I or existing work for demonstration and validation. The second phase shall include (a) material or material configuration selection for relevant missions (b) independent assessment materials or material configurations as required by Government sponsors to validate the key properties of proposed prototypes and operational utility (c) efforts to develop, test, and deploy prototype devices which benefit from novel material solutions or material configurations in applicable test ranges or in operational tests. A completed prototype shall be delivered to the Government at the end of Phase II.\n\nPHASE 3 DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Operationalization of the prototype to military and civilian missions is the final goal in Phase III. The novel material or material configuration demonstrated in Phase II will be modified as required and integrated into products meeting Department of Defense requirements. This demonstrated prototype solution shall be produced in limited quantities to prove feasibility of production at required rates. Novel material solutions or material configurations will be commercialized and transition to relevant military missions or platforms.  "
