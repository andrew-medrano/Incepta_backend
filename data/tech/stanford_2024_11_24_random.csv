"Stanford University","Multi-layer self-healing devices using immiscible dynamic polymers","Docket #: S23-010","","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/multi-layer-self-healing-devices-using-immiscible-dynamic-polymers",""Researchers at Stanford University have developed a multilayered immiscible polymer system capable of autonomously realigning its layers to enhance the healing process after damage. Self-healing polymers"," which can recover from various forms of damage"," often include conductive or dielectric particles for added functionality and are typically arranged in a multilayer configuration. While these polymers usually self-heal effectively when layers are aligned"," misalignment can significantly reduce healing efficacy. To address this"," Stanford researchers created a laminate with immiscible dynamic polymers"," each with the same dynamic bond for strong interlayer adhesion but different backbones for interfacial tension-mediated realignment. This design ensures complete self-directed structural and functional recovery after damage.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Soft robotics"," Surgical modeling"," Films and coatings for industrial uses"," Implantable flexible electronics"," Wearable flexible electronics.\n\nAdvantages: Less risk of misalignment and functional loss"," Can incorporate multiple functions"," Inspired by the human skin healing process"," Potential for countless applications with other immiscible polymers.""
"Stanford University","Phytophotonic Approach to Enhanced Photosynthesis","Docket #: S19-357",""Published Application: WO2022067258"," Published Application: 20240276925"","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/phytophotonic-approach-enhanced-photosynthesis",""Stanford researchers have shown how to use fluorescent and phosphorescent materials to provide plants with photons in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) range for increased crop yields and CO2 fixation. While genetically modifying plants with enhanced photosynthetic efficiency in a scalable manner has proven difficult"," tailoring resources plants need is much easier. This invention increases the amount of PAR photons plants receive through a two-pronged approach: a) fluorescent down-conversion materials and 2) phosphorescent materials. The former down converts UV photos to green wavelengths to better target unsaturated photoreceptors deeper within the canopy or individual leaves. The second approach utilizes phosphorescent materials to address periods without direct illumination and overcoming saturated photosystems. Energy absorbed by the phosphorescent materials are emitted on a time delay to help spread excess solar energy over time. These materials can be applied via thin films on bioreactor surfaces"," greenhouse roofing"," directly onto plant surfaces"," or in the soil surrounding the plants.\nStage of Research\n\nApplications: Bioprocessing: bioreactors"," fuels"," chemicals"," etc."," Agriculture: increased crop yields and/or CO2 sequestration"," Forestry: CO2 sequestration.\n\nAdvantages: Wider applicability via conversion to green light"," Targeting and saturation of cells deeper in foliage and canopy.""

"Stanford University","QUANTIFICATION OF CELLULAR PROTEINS USING BARCODED BINDING MOIETIES","Docket #: S20-449",""Published Application: WO2022164893"," Published Application: 20240125797"","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/quantification-cellular-proteins-using-barcoded-binding-moieties",""Technology Reference: Chan Zuckerberg CZB-190S; Stanford S20-449\nSummary\nResearchers at Stanford have developed a method enabling quantification of intracellular protein levels using oligonucleotide-barcoded antibodies.\nMultiplexing single cell technologies affords researchers the ability to characterize cell states and identify gene regulatory programs across various cell types. The application of sequencing-based surface protein quantification using barcoded antibodies to intracellular or nuclear protein targets has been challenging. Nuclear targets are particularly challenging due to high levels of background oligo-antibody staining"," potentially driven by the conjugated single stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligo. However"," quantification of nuclear transcription factors"," the drivers of gene regulation"," would enable critical understanding of gene regulatory processes. For this reason"," several approaches to reduce non-specific staining include saturating cells with single stranded nucleic acids or other charged polymers to block non-specific binding to ssDNA oligos.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed methods quantify intracellular and nuclear targets within a single cell using antibodies conjugated to barcoded oligonucleotides. The inventors reduced non-specific oligo-antibody staining by coating the conjugated ssDNA oligo with single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs). The inventors demonstrate the utility of this technology in profiling CD4 memory T cells by combining SSB-coated oligo-antibodies in nuclear protein quantification with ATAC-seq and RNA-seq (NEAT-seq).\nStage of Development\nResearch – in vitro\n\nApplications: Directly measure single cell protein levels of cytoplasmic or nuclear targets"," like transcription factors"," with improved signal over background."," Oligo-antibody staining in combination with other single cell genomic measurements (e.g."," ATAC-seq"," RNA-seq"," Hi-C"," etc.) or perturbating screening for comprehensive cell profiling..\n\nAdvantages: Modular and flexible design can be applied to any target binding moiety (e.g."," antibody fragment"," ligand"," aptamer"," etc.) and incorporation to existing single cell pipelines (i.e."," split-pool protocols and microfluidics)"," Single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs) bind with high affinity to ssDNA in a sequence non-specific manner"," with low affinity for nuclear dsDNA."," SSBs are compatible with oligo PCR amplification steps during library generation.""
