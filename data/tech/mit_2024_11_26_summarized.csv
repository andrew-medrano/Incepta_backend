The first stream of an aqueous solution is processed through a desalination or nanofiltration system. The second stream is mixed with the output from the first system, maintaining specific flow ratios. A liquid composition is then directed into an electrically driven separation apparatus, which employs monovalent-selective ion exchange membranes to extract unwanted ions, resulting in a treated diluate with a sodium chloride ratio of less than 0.7.\\n\\n### Applications:\\nThis technology can be applied in the oil and gas industry, particularly for enhancing hydrocarbon recovery from reservoirs by improving the quality of water used in extraction processes. It may also be beneficial in other sectors requiring the treatment of aqueous solutions for the removal of monovalent ions.\\n\\n### Problem Solved:\\nThe technology addresses the issue of high sodium chloride concentration in the water used for hydrocarbon recovery, which can hinder extraction efficiency. By providing a method to reduce the sodium chloride ratio in treated effluent, it enhances the capability to recover hydrocarbons from reservoirs, thus improving overall operational effectiveness and potentially reducing costs associated with water quality management in hydrocarbon extraction.","A first stream of an aqueous solution is processed through an upstream desalination or nanofiltration system, while a second stream is mixed with the diluate output from the desalination or nanofiltration system at a specified flow ratio.
