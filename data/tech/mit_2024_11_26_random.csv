MIT,Method and System for Water Treatment for Increasing Hydrocarbon Recovery from HydrocarbonReservoirs,Case number: #21119,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/method-and-system-water-treatment-increasing,"A first stream of an aqueous solution flows through an upstream desalination or nanofiltration system. A second stream of the aqueous solution is mixed with the diluate output from the upstream desalination system or with the diluate or concentrate output from the upstream nanofiltration system with a flow ratio of the second stream of the aqueous solution to the feed stream of < 0.47 or > 0.63. A liquid composition flows into the concentrate channels of an electrically driven separation apparatus, while the feed stream flows into at least the diluate channels at a ratio of 0.3 to 0.81 to the flow of the liquid composition. An applied voltage selectively draws monovalent ions from the feed stream in the diluate channels through the monovalent-selective ion exchange membranes into the concentrate channels to produce a treated diluate having a sodium chloride ratio (SCR) < 0.7."

MIT,Two Wave Coupling Using Phase ChirpedResonators,Case number: #15486,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/two-wave-coupling-using-phase-chirped-resonators,"This invention is suited for applications in communications, radar, broadcasting and astronomy.\n\nTechnology: This invention is a frequency-chirped nano-antenna that provides efficient sub-wavelength vertical emission from a dielectric waveguide. This nano-antenna consists of a set of plasmonic dipoles (resonators) on the opposite side of a Si3N4 waveguide from a ground plane. The resulting structure, which is less than half a wavelength long, emits a broadband beam that can be coupled into an optical fiber. Because this coupling structure is short, it is suitable for vertical coupling in Silicon On Insulator (SOI) based Optical Phased Arrays (OPAs).\n\nProblem Addressed: Conventional vertical couplers are designed to be large to maximize coupling efficiency. This size limits the coupler bandwidth and usefulness for other application, such as Optical Phased Arrays (OPAs). Therefore, there is a need for compact couplers that have high coupling efficiency.\n\nAdvantages: Better coupling efficiency than traditional vertical couplers. Reduced element size"

MIT,RNA Engineering for CRISPR Synthetic Circuits and EndogenousRegulation,Case number: #16876,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/rna-engineering-crispr-synthetic-circuits-and,"Various aspects and embodiments of the present disclosure relate to methods and compositions that combine multiple mammalian RNA regulatory strategies, including RNA triple helix structures, introns, microRNAs, and ribozymes with Cas-based CRISPR transcription factors and ribonuclease-based RNA processing in human cells. The methods and compositions of the present disclosure, in some embodiments, enable multiplexed production of proteins and multiple guide RNAs from a single compact RNA-polymerase-II expressed transcript for efficient modulation of synthetic constructs and endogenous human promoters.\nThe generation of robust, scalable gene networks that interfere minimally with endogenous cellular processes is fundamental to synthetic biology. The use of RNA regulatory strategies in combination with CRISPR/Cas transcription factors (CRISPR-TFs) allows for the conditional regulation of large-scale synthetic and endogenous gene networks in eukaryotic cells. The system is uniquely suited to build sophisticated circuits and transcriptional cascades that could be linked to specific events (e.g., cell cycle) or environments (e.g., chemical gradients).\n\nTechnology: Here we describe a genome editing toolkit for the generation of robust, scalable synthetic gene networks and native gene modulation in eukaryotic cells. Existing CRISPR/Cas methodology cannot be used for conditional gene regulation, as the guide RNAs (gRNAs) used to target DNA sites can only be expressed from RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) promoters, most of which are constitutively active. This technology produces gRNAs from RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) promoters, allowing for conditional gene expression and tunable responses to external inputs. The system integrates CRISPR-TFs with RNA regulatory machinery (e.g., Csy4 endonuclease, RNA triple helix) to produce functional gRNAs from RNAP II promoters while preserving downstream translation and expression of the harboring gene. The system is capable of multiplexed gRNA expression from one individual transcript, thus modulating multiple nodes from a single one and enabling sophisticated regulatory circuits with a large number of interconnections.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current methods for genome editing (e.g., CRISPR/Cas) have the potential to modulate gene expression in a tunable manner but are often limited by a combination of scalability, lack of conditional regulation, and inefficient regulation of endogenous promoters. This genome engineering toolkit provides the means to regulate and synchronize multiplexed, large-scale synthetic gene networks in addition to modulating endogenous gene expression.\n\nAdvantages: Multiplexed, large-scale genome engineering. Synthesize multi-stage transcriptional cascades. Regulate synthetic and endogenous networks"
