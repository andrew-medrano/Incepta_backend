Researchers at Stanford University have developed a multilayered system of immiscible dynamic polymers designed to autonomously realign its layers to improve the healing process following damage. These self-healing polymers, which are typically enhanced with conductive or dielectric particles, are arranged in multilayers.

While genetically modifying plants with enhanced photosynthetic efficiency in a scalable manner has proven difficult, tailoring resources plants need is much easier. This invention increases the amount of PAR photons plants receive through a two-pronged approach: a) fluorescent down-conversion materials and 2) phosphorescent materials. The former down converts UV photos to green wavelengths to better target unsaturated photoreceptors deeper within the canopy or individual leaves. The second approach utilizes phosphorescent materials to address periods without direct illumination and overcoming saturated photosystems.

Stanford researchers have developed a ""Phytophotonic Approach to Enhanced Photosynthesis"" that utilizes fluorescent and phosphorescent materials to enhance the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) available to plants. This method aims to increase crop yields and improve CO2 fixation without the need for genetically modifying plants. The technology employs two key strategies: fluorescent down-conversion materials convert UV light into green wavelengths, enabling better absorption by deeper leaf layers, while phosphorescent materials provide a delayed emission of absorbed energy to assist during periods without direct light and help prevent saturating photosystems. These materials can be applied in various ways, including thin films on bioreactor surfaces, greenhouse roofing, directly on plants, or in the surrounding soil.

**Applications:**  
- Bioprocessing: Enhancements in bioreactors for producing fuels, chemicals, etc.  
- Agriculture: Increased crop yields and improved CO2 sequestration.  
- Forestry: Enhanced CO2 sequestration through improved plant efficiency.

**Problem Solved:**  
The technology addresses the challenge of insufficient light reaching deeper parts of plant foliage, which limits photosynthetic efficiency and crop yields. It also mitigates the effects of light saturation in photosystems during bright conditions and provides a solution for times when plants do not receive direct sunlight.","Stanford researchers developed a method using fluorescent and phosphorescent materials to supply plants with photons in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) range, aiming to enhance crop yields and CO2 fixation.
