Current connectors are limited in its scalability.\nSuperconducting coaxial cables have not been seriously considered for connecting qubits in neighboring dilution refrigerators because they lose quantum information too quickly at typical superconducting qubit frequencies (approximately 2-8 GHz). However, it is known that such cables are extremely low loss at low frequencies when the wavelength of light is comparable to the fridge-to-fridge separation. This invention enables qubits to be strongly coupled to the low-frequency modes of superconducting coaxial cables using a circuit that transduces quantum information from typical qubit frequencies down to a lower frequency, the so-called baseband, where the tradeoff between frequency-dependent loss and thermal fluctuations is optimized.\nStage of Development\n\nApplications: Quantum computing data centers, where computational tasks can be distributed over superconducting quantum processors in different dilution refrigerators, End user will be researchers and industry seeking to run larger quantum simulations or solve larger optimization problems not currently possible with current computation capabilities.\n\nAdvantages: Scalable, Improves the accuracy and capacity of the quantum channel, especially using frequencies around 200 MHz instead of 8 GHz, Enables many hundreds of times increase in transmission rates, especially in contrast to other approaches, i.e. using optical photons, or microwave photons through waveguides.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford have developed a novel approach to interconnect qubits across multiple dilution refrigerators, allowing for the creation of larger superconducting quantum systems.

"Stanford University","Ultrasound Heat Therapy Device for Preventing Perineal Tears During Labor and Delivery","Docket #: S23-250","","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/ultrasound-heat-therapy-device-preventing-perineal-tears-during-labor-and-delivery","Of the 1.4 million first time mothers giving vaginal birth in the United States, approximately 75% will experience tearing of their vagina or perineum. During labor, the pelvic floor stretches to accommodate fetal passage, and overstretching of this relatively inelastic tissue can result in tearing and permanent injury. Up to 7% of mothers will experience the most severe form of tears, where the laceration extends from the vaginal opening all the way to the anus and rectum, damaging the underlying tissues. These severe injuries require comprehensive repair, and put patients at increased risk of post-partum complications such as infections, wound dehiscence, and pain. Patients with severe tears are also more likely to experience long term sequelae of their injuries including incontinence, prolapse, and dyspareunia. These result in ongoing follow-up visits, out of pocket costs, and in some cases additional surgical procedures. The prevention of perineal trauma during childbirth remains a significant concern for maternal health.\nEvidence suggests that applying heat to the perineal area can potentially reduce the risk of trauma by increasing tissue elasticity and blood flow. However, current methods for delivering this heat, such as conductive heating pads or compresses, present challenges in achieving safe and effective temperatures. Conductive heat can easily lead to burns, especially in the sensitive perineal region of patients that are often under anesthesia. Most available equipment is not designed to provide the consistent, controlled heat necessary to induce beneficial changes at the tissue level. The development of an ultrasound-based heating device specifically for the perineum offers a promising solution to these challenges. By using ultrasound technology, heat can be applied more precisely and safely, reducing the risk of burns while delivering the optimal temperature needed to increase tissue elasticity and potentially lower the risk of perineal tears. This approach combines both safety and effectiveness, addressing the usability gaps in current heating methods and providing a novel intervention for childbirth-related perineal trauma prevention.\nInventors at Stanford have developed a handheld therapeutic device that uses ultrasound energy to heat the tissues of the perineum. The device consists of a reusable ultrasound unit with a single use disposable gel pad which will be exchanged between patients and can be easily replaced if soiled. The energy from the device improves pelvic floor elasticity by 1) changing the viscoelastic properties of the underlying tissue at a precisely controlled depth, 2) stimulating blood flow to improve tissue's resistance to tearing, and 3) inhibiting neural pathways that lead to over-contraction of the pelvic muscles during the delivery. The device provides a low-cost therapeutic solution that ensures sterility, patient comfort, and ease of use at the bedside.\nStage of Development\nProof of Concept - The device is at the proof-of-concept stage. Existing literature supports the efficacy of heat in reducing perineal trauma, and we have successfully demonstrated that our ultrasound technology can safely heat tissues at the required depth without causing burns. This establishes a strong foundation for the device's potential in preventing perineal tears during childbirth. Further development is focused on optimizing the device for clinical use.\n\nApplications: Perineal trauma, Maternal health, OB/GYN, Labor and Delivery, Medical device, Therapeutic ultrasound.\n\nAdvantages: No existing commercial solutions aimed at reducing perineal tears during delivery, Precise control of heat delivery: precision targeting and controlled temperature that ensures an optimal temperature at deeper tissues without overheating the skin, Non-invasive and safe, Portable and user-friendly design.","**Summary:** This technology is designed to prevent perineal tears during labor and delivery by applying targeted ultrasound heat therapy to the perineal area. The innovation builds on evidence that localized heat can enhance tissue elasticity and blood circulation, potentially reducing the likelihood of tearing as the pelvic floor stretches. Traditional methods like conductive heating pads pose risks of burns and ineffective temperature control, which are more pronounced in patients under anesthesia.

**Applications:** The device is aimed primarily at first-time mothers undergoing vaginal birth, with potential uses in clinical settings such as hospitals and birthing centers. It could be incorporated into labor and delivery protocols to improve maternal health outcomes by reducing the incidence of perineal trauma.

**Problem Solved:** The technology addresses the significant issue of perineal tearing, which affects approximately 75% of first-time vaginal births, leading to severe injuries in up to 7% of cases. These injuries can result in long-term complications, including incontinence and pain, as well as increased healthcare costs from follow-up visits and potential surgeries. By providing a safer method to apply heat, the device aims to decrease the risk of these injuries and enhance overall maternal care during childbirth.","Approximately 75% of first-time mothers in the U.S. experience tearing of the vagina or perineum during vaginal birth, with up to 7% suffering severe tears that extend to the anus and rectum.

Early-stage HCC patients often undergo surgery to remove damaged livers as a means of disease intervention. However, the effectiveness of surgery is often counteracted by high recurrence rates, which can range from 50-70%. To reduce high recurrence, adjuvant therapies can be used in the clinic, yet these therapies cause severe adverse events in more than a third of the patients.\nOne of the primary challenges of combating early recurrence is identifying reliable biomarkers to help predict patients who are most likely to experience HCC recurrence after treatments like surgery or chemoembolization. Prior biomarkers for HCC, such as gene signatures or protein expression, are limited in their ability to provide information about the spatial distribution of cells or how cancer and immune cells interact with each other.\nTo address this gap Stanford researchers developed a novel spatial signature/ biomarker capable of identifying patients at high risk of recurrence with high accuracy.

However, in recent years these drugs have been misappropriated for recreational use, spurring a public health crisis. In the US alone there were over 80,000 deaths due to opioid overdose in 2022. Naloxone has proven to be a key tool in the fight against opioid overdose by acting as an agonist of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). However, use of naloxone for opioid overdose has drawbacks, including that naloxone requires larger, repeated doses in response to more potent fentanyl.

Specifically, the immune response to these vaccine candidates is directed towards specific epitopes that are conserved across strains and are less mutable than epitopes that are traditionally exposed. A modified H5 HA antigen is presented in a defined orientation via electrostatic interactions with the adjuvant such that specific epitopes are exposed and the immune response is therefore directed towards those exposed epitopes.\nThis in turn will confer immunity to a larger breadth of viral variants. Experiments in mice with these vaccine candidates have shown that these vaccine candidates generate broad immunity to a number of influenza strains.\n\nApplications: Vaccine candidates for H5 avian influeza, Vaccine candidates for a breadth of influenza viruses.\n\nAdvantages: Generates broad immunity to a number of influenza viral strains via exposure of a conserved epitope.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford University have developed innovative vaccine candidates targeting H5 influenza viruses, which pose a significant threat to public health due to their high mortality rates despite limited human transmission.

Irrigating the kidney with this cationic biopolymer during surgery could serve as a novel method to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and sepsis in kidney stone procedures.\nKidney stones are an increasingly prevalent urological disorder, often causing significant pain and requiring surgical intervention. Pathogenic bacteria are present in up to 40% of stones and can form biofilms which protect them from antibiotic treatments. As a result, stone surgeries can inadvertently disperse bacterial biofilms across the urinary tract and cause up to 30% of patients to develop a UTI and 15% to develop sepsis. Despite these known complications, little effort has been made to address this clinical issue. The standard clinical practice involves urine tests for infection followed by antibiotic treatment if the culture is positive. However, urine culture positivity rates are low compared to pelvic and stone culture positivity rates and intravenous antimicrobial therapies do not lower the risk of postoperative UTIs. Therefore, a new method of UTI and sepsis prevention during kidney stone procedures is needed.\nA cationic biopolymer has been demonstrated to interact with negatively charged bacterial surfaces, disrupting their membranes and inducing cell death through the leakage of intracellular components. Furthermore, the biopolymer disrupts bacterial biofilms, thereby reducing their resilience to antibiotic treatments. And, in the urinary tract, the biopolymer interacts with the urothelium, inducing exfoliation that expels and facilitates the eradication of highly resistant intracellular bacterial reservoirs. Treatment of colonized patient kidney stones with the biopolymer resulted in a greater than 90% bacterial viability decrease after 90 minutes. Importantly, histological analysis of human urothelium did not show any abnormalities or cytotoxic effects after treatment with the biopolymer. Therefore, the inclusion of this cationic biopolymer in saline irrigation methods during kidney surgeries can be an impactful preventative measure to decrease UTIs and sepsis in kidney stone patients.\nStage of Development:\nPreclinical – in-vivo\nContinued research – Large animal studies\n\nApplications: Antimicrobial irrigation during kidney stone surgery, Antimicrobial irrigation during endourological procedures, Prevention of UTI and sepsis.\n\nAdvantages: Currently, there are no known intravesical therapies that have broad range antimicrobial and exfoliative effects., Improves antimicrobial treatment independently of bacterial strain, biofilm biomass intensity and antibiotic resistance pattern., Biocompatible with human urinary tract tissue.","**Summary:** Stanford scientists have developed a method to treat colonized kidney stones using a cationic biopolymer, which successfully disrupts bacterial biofilms and decreases bacterial presence without harming kidney tissue.

They found that inhibition of PTER, a key enzyme that regulates N-acetyltaurine metabolism, leads to N-acetyltaurine accumulation and a reduction in food intake. Therefore, the use of PTER inhibitors may be an effective way of treating obesity and other metabolic disorders.\nN-acetyltaurine is an abundant endogenous metabolite whose levels are dynamically regulated by diverse physiologic perturbations that increase taurine and/or acetate flux, including endurance exercise, alcohol consumption, and nutritional taurine supplementation. Interestingly, taurine supplementation has been reported to reduce mitochondrial redox stress, enhance exercise performance, and suppress body weight. PTER, an orphan body mass index-associated enzyme, was shown to have N-acetyltransferase/hydrolase activity and be capable of converting taurine to N-acetyltaurine. Genetic ablation of PTER and/or pharmacological administration of N-acetyltaurine in mice resulted in suppressed body weight and adiposity.\nIterative screening for and optimization of PTER inhibitors resulted in the discovery of small molecule inhibitors with a > 250-fold selectivity for PTER. Importantly, treatment with the lead compound caused an increase of N-acetyltaurine in mice and an acute decrease in food intake. Consequently, PTER inhibitors can potentially be used as a method of treatment for obesity and other cardiometabolic disorders.\nStage of Development:\nResearch: in vivo\n\nApplications: Treatment of obesity and other metabolic disorders, Energy balance and body weight control, PTER inhibitors can be administered as a therapeutic.\n\nAdvantages: Novel inhibitors of energy balance linked to taurine metabolism, PTER activity can be inhibited as a method of increasing N-acteyltaurine levels to treat obesity.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford have identified small molecule compounds that inhibit the enzyme PTER, which plays a critical role in regulating the metabolism of N-acetyltaurine. The inhibition of PTER results in the accumulation of N-acetyltaurine and a decrease in food intake, which may provide an effective strategy for treating obesity and related metabolic disorders. The compounds were found to have strong selectivity for PTER, and testing in mice indicated that these inhibitors led to increased levels of N-acetyltaurine and reduced body weight.

**Applications:** The technology has potential applications in the treatment of obesity and other metabolic disorders through the use of PTER inhibitors to modulate N-acetyltaurine levels and decrease food intake.

**Problem Solved:** This technology addresses the pressing issue of obesity and associated metabolic disorders by providing a novel approach to regulate appetite and body weight through the modulation of the PTER/N-acetyltaurine pathway.","Stanford scientists have identified compounds that inhibit the enzyme PTER, which regulates N-acetyltaurine metabolism, resulting in its accumulation and reduced food intake.

"Stanford University","Increased Packaging Capacity of Viral Vectors for Genome Editing","Docket #: S24-279","","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/increased-packaging-capacity-viral-vectors-genome-editing","Stanford researchers have developed a method to overcome the packaging capacity limitation of adeno-associated virus (AAV) Vector CRISPR/Cas9 systems to help treat genetic diseases for which the cargo is larger than 4.7kb.\nCRISPR/Cas9 systems have gained momentum in the past decade as a fast, cheap and relatively targeted approach to genome editing. Adeno-associated viral vectors are commonly used to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 due to their efficiency, safety, lower immunogenicity and non-integrative features (i.e. AAV does not integrate into the host genome reducing the likelihood of Cas9 off-target effects). Despite these benefits, one of AAV's shortcomings is its relatively low packaging capacity of 4.7 kb which makes AAV's difficult to use for larger/bulkier cargo.\nTo overcome this packaging limitation, Stanford researchers developed a delivery construct that increases the packaging capacity of recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors.

Current treatment modalities, including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and even cutting-edge immunotherapies, have failed to provide substantial improvements in patient outcomes. Despite the therapeutic promise shown by immunotherapies in rodent models, their translation to human patients has faced significant hurdles.

Mitochondria are crucial for cellular homeostasis and the tumor microenvironment, supporting tumor growth and evasion. Cancerous and adjacent immune cells exhibit metabolic changes including the transfer of mitochondria from non-cancerous to cancer cells, facilitating tumor proliferation.

Targeting these epitopes for vaccine development could lead to effective vaccines for TB.\nTB is a significant global health problem that has been worsening in recent years with 1.6 million deaths in 2021. Despite the high mortality caused by TB, many individuals that test positive for TB have no symptoms and do not spread the bacteria to others. These patients have a latent TB infection and their immune system were able to successfully control the TB infection. Additionally, some patients have had significant exposure to TB and are not only asymptomatic but also test negative for a TB infection. This suggests that these individuals remain uninfected or rapidly clear their infection early on following exposure. The adaptive immune systems of these patients have likely targeted a TB epitope which is highly effective and ideal antigen candidates for vaccine design.\nA TB epitope that is recognized by CD4 T cells in patients that are naturally resistant to TB has been identified. Importantly, an improved antigen discovery library is expected to identify additional targets which could be highly relevant for TB vaccine design.\nStage of Development:\nin vitro\n\nApplications: Development of vaccines against TB, Increasing vaccine efficacy against TB.\n\nAdvantages: Epitopes that are preferentially targeted by individuals resistant to TB infections, Identification of several epitopes for vaccine design.","**Summary:** Stanford scientists have identified tuberculosis epitopes that are preferentially recognized by T cells in patients who naturally resist or manage TB infection.

By repurposing FDA-approved drugs, this novel approach offers a practical and timely intervention for treating Alzheimer's and related tauopathies.\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a global health crisis, marked by the buildup of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) primarily composed of tau protein. A critical factor in AD progression is the propagation of tau protein, which drives the spread of disease pathology throughout the brain, leading to neuronal damage and accelerated cognitive decline. Current therapeutic approaches mainly target amyloid plaques, another hallmark of AD, but have shown limited success. This has resulted in a significant gap in effective treatments that can halt or reverse the progression of AD, underscoring the urgent need for new therapeutic strategies. The propagation of tau protein presents an untapped opportunity for developing novel interventions.\nOur invention addresses this unmet need by targeting tau protein propagation, offering a novel and previously unexplored therapeutic pathway. Stanford researchers have delved into the mechanisms underlying tau propagation and identified specific sequences responsible for this activity. Leveraging this knowledge has enabled the screening of a range of bio-reagents, which identified candidates capable of inhibiting tau propagation.

This approach of using polyacrylamides to selectively disrupt bacterial membranes as a killing mechanism is able to circumvent known antimicrobial resistance pathways. Consequently, this technology could play a significant role in addressing the growing antibiotic resistance crisis.\nAntimicrobial resistance is a critical global health threat, with antibiotic-resistant pathogens projected to cause over ten million annual deaths by 2050. Despite this crisis, the development of new antibiotic classes has stagnated while resistant bacteria rapidly emerge. Common resistance mechanisms include drug uptake inhibition, drug target modification, and enhanced drug efflux. Broad-spectrum antibiotics that disrupt bacterial membranes are an attractive solution that could potentially bypass these mechanisms, but existing compounds face challenges in synthesis, scalability, toxicity, and/or stability. Polyacrylamides offer promise in addressing these issues, with inexpensive scalable synthesis and high chemical stability enabling potential global distribution without cold chain requirements.\nThe synthesized polyacrylamide compounds demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative (E. coli and K. pneumoniae) and Gram-positive (S. aureus and E. faecium) bacteria, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) approaching clinically relevant levels. Importantly, these polymers exhibit selectivity in killing bacteria over lysing red blood cells, with a 50% hemolytic concentration (HC50) more than twenty times higher than their MICs.

While this response is crucial for protecting the body from bioactive foreign substances, it can be a problem when implants are intentionally placed in the body for treatment. FBR against these implants can lead to complications such as malfunction, infection, soft tissue disfigurement, and pain. Acellular dermal matrix (ADM) has been used as a coating on implants to effectively attenuate FBR, despite an incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Given that ADM is expensive and not easily scalable, it is important to identify alternatives by uncovering its mechanisms of action.\nStanford researchers have discovered that SPP1, upregulated by ADM, is necessary and sufficient for FBR attenuation. When a recombinant-SPP1-loaded hydrogel was placed adjacent to an implant, the fibrotic capsule was thinner compared to the conventional FBR. Additionally, the connective tissue architecture within the fibrotic encapsulation was comparable to that derived from ADM-coated implants. Directly managing FBR's main underlying driver SPP-1 could lead to significant improvements in biocompatibility of implantable devices.\nFigure\nStage of Development\nIn vivo data\n\nApplications: Biomedical implants, Biomedical devices.\n\nAdvantages: Cost effective, Scalable.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford University have identified that recombinant osteopontin (SPP1) protein is effective in reducing foreign body response (FBR), which is the immune reaction that creates dense fibrotic scar tissue around implanted devices.

While scientists have discovered the genetic basis for the disorder in many patients (mutations in exon 8A of the calcium channel CACNA1C), there are no available treatments that act on this root cause.\nResearchers therefore developed a treatment strategy to modulate the splicing of CACNA1C. Using human cortical spheroids derived from patient cells, they screened a series of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to identify one that biases pre-mRNA splicing to include the healthy exon 8 instead of the mutated exon 8A. Scientists showed that this candidate could restore calcium defects in patient-derived cortical neurons, influence interneuron migration, and restore activity-dependent dendritic retraction in transplanted cortical organoids.

To prevent toxicity from hyperactivity, the activation state of these receptors can be regulated by a drug that acts on proteases.\nWhile chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy effectively treats liquid cancers, further improvements in persistence and potency are needed to combat solid cancers clinically. Regulating cytokine-triggered intracellular signaling cascades related to growth and proliferation could help augment CAR-T cell activity, enhancing anti-tumor efficacy.\nTo achieve this, Stanford researchers developed chimeric cytokine receptor (CCR) systems capable of constitutive signaling in the absence of their cognate cytokines. Their CCR system is comprised of two subunits, each including a heterologous dimerization domain and a cytokine receptor intracellular signaling domain (ICD). Because a cognate for the first dimerization domain is selected as the second dimerization domain and the two domains are in proximity, therapeutic cells with these CCRs have active intracellular signaling associated with persistence and potency downstream. The signaling cascade can be interrupted by regulating protease activity on ICDs to avoid exceeding the therapeutic window and causing toxicity.

Diagnosis of celiac disease is determined by presence of transglutaminase 2 (TG2) autoantibody and histology of intestinal biopsies. However, those seeking diagnosis often already maintain a gluten-free diet prior to gastroenterology consultation and therefore test negative for autoantibody and present normal duodenal mucosa. So, it is necessary to have patients receive a gluten-rich diet for weeks to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Celiac patients will thus experience symptoms including diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain. Air-liquid interface (ALI) organoids enable culturing epithelium and stroma to recapitulate the human small intestine, and patient-derived organoids can be used for suspected celiac patient diagnosis instead. ALI organoids could be used whether the individual is on a gluten-free diet or gluten-rich diet.

A significant number of marginal organs are recovered but are not transplanted due to concerns of poor quality, suboptimal function, and limited regenerative capacity. What is critically needed to address this organ shortage are methods that allow for marginal organ rehabilitation, thus enabling them to be successfully transplanted without compromising patient outcomes.\nThere are two features of the proposed technology. The first is a perfusion device that mimics heart function, an oxygenator that mimics lung function, and a dialysis system that mimics kidney function. The second feature is the use of a novel perfusate additive, liposome-packaged human WNT protein (L-WNT).

The uSMAART (ultra-Sensitive Measurement of Aggregated Activity in Restricted cell-Types) technology enables the study of small dynamic variation of one or more biological process in the healthy and pathological brain from animal undergoing ecologically relevant behavior.\nMore Details: Fiber photometry, a measurement technique that aggregates fluorescence signal using a fiber optic, is a highly pervasive approach in the field of systems neuroscience to study in vivo brain tissue dynamics during ecologically relevant behavior. Despite its common usage by researchers and companies alike, none of the state-of-the art fiber photometry device is capable of detecting small and fast signal changes in a low-light regime in freely behaving animals. Current technologies are benchmarked against cytosolic calcium indicators whose dynamic ranges far exceed that of the instrument and biological noises. Therefore, when used outside of this original configuration, i.e. with other fluorescent indicators (voltage, neuromodulator sensors…) with much weaker dynamic ranges, these instruments do not protect against unwanted noise sources which can lead to biological confounds, especially when the instrumental noise correlates with the animal motion.\nInventors at Stanford have developed a novel fiber-optic technology that achieve ~10 fold greater sensitivity than prior fiber photometry systems and is immune to optical artefacts induced by animal motions. The uSMAART (ultra-Sensitive Measurement of Aggregated Activity in Restricted cell-Types) technology tracks signals from up to 2 reporters from up to 2 different brain regions concurrently, with high sensitivity. The uSMAART system outperforms similar fiber photometry implementations in at least one of the three following aspects: (1) stability of illumination source, (2) immunity to fiber motion-induced illumination artefacts, and (3) detection sensitivity in the visible range.

"Stanford University","Strategy and technological implementations for concurrent fluorescence measurements of multiple biological parameters in behaving animals","Docket #: S23-493","","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/strategy-and-technological-implementations-concurrent-fluorescence-measurements-multiple","Inventors at Stanford have developed a novel strategy to perform concurrent fluorescence measurements of multiple biological parameters in freely moving and head-restrained animals. As more genetically encoded fluorescent indicators (GEFI) are being developed to monitor, in living animals, a wide range of biological phenomenon (e.g. transmembrane voltage, ions, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, opioids, pH…), optical approaches that capture the precise temporal relationship of many physiological processes simultaneously in awake animals become critically necessary. Unlike our invention, none of the existing technologies offers the experimental flexibility to combine multiple fluorescence sensors and monitor those signals.\nTwo of the most common optical tools in neuroscience to study in vivo brain tissue dynamics during ecologically relevant behavior are fiber photometry and mesoscopic imaging. Fiber photometry is a measurement technique that aggregates fluorescence signal using a fiber optic. While it captures signal at the tip of the fiber, mesoscope imaging will instead capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of the fluorescence signal in awake, head-fixed animals. Recent studies have used both techniques to optically sense voltage, calcium, or neuromodulator dynamics in a variety mouse behavior.\nHowever, none of the state-of-the art fiber photometry devices or 1-photon epifluorescence mesoscope systems are capable of imaging more than 1 biological parameter at once while precisely referencing biological noises. Indeed, until now, there has not been a suitable method to account for various biological artifacts while imaging 2 spectrally orthogonal fluorescent proteins that capture two independent biological parameters. Therefore, while multiplexing fluorescent signals gain more appeal in the field, molecular strategy and technological implementations to achieve this with high sensitivity and low cost is needed.\nHere, we introduce a new molecular strategy and offer two technological implementations for fiber photometry and mesoscope imaging. While the former relies on a lock-in amplification technique, the latter relies on precise control over the illumination activation and imaging frame acquisition. Our simple molecular solution can be used with any fiber photometry systems (used in freely behaving animals) or 1-photon epifluorescence wide-field imaging techniques (used in head-fixed animals) to probe the dynamics of multiple molecular phenomena concurrently in awake animals. This strategy is universally applicable to any fluorescent reporters, from genetically encoded fluorescent proteins to synthetic dyes and nanoparticles. This strategy will reduce by 50% the cost of instrumentations used for fluorescence multiplexing of dynamic processes.\nStage of Development:\nResearch – in vivo – working prototype and proof-of-concept in mice\n\nApplications: Neuroscience research, Medical Diagnostics and Treatment Monitoring, Pharmaceutical Development, Drug discovery platform, Analytic chemistry.\n\nAdvantages: A cost-effective method to multiplex fluorescence signals., Simultaneous dual biological parameters with identical performance, in freely and head-restrained behaving mouse., Safeguarding against instrumental and/or biological artefacts., Universally applicable to any fluorescent reporters, from genetically encoded fluorescent proteins to synthetic dyes and nanoparticles..","**Summary:** Inventors at Stanford have created a new strategy for simultaneous fluorescence measurements of various biological parameters in freely moving and head-restrained animals.

Drug-resistant infections are often difficult to treat because of the presence of persister cells, a subpopulation of bacterial cells that is highly tolerant of traditional antibiotics. Persister cells are dormant, making them less susceptible to many antibiotics, which are designed to kill growing cells. Administration of nanoparticles in combination with one or more antibiotics was found to be highly efficacious in eradicating persister cells and effective against both planktonic bacteria as well as biofilms for a broad range of bacterial species, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

"Stanford University","Simplified sequencing library preparation for digested DNA and improvements to cDNA library priming","Docket #: S22-283","Published Application: WO2024073034","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/simplified-sequencing-library-preparation-digested-dna-and-improvements-cdna-library","The cost of DNA and RNA sequencing have decreased in recent years to aid effective research and clinical applications; however, the labor time and throughput of preparing DNA and RNA sequencing libraries remains a challenge. To address these challenges, inventors at Stanford created a simplified protocol for DNA sequencing library preparation as well as a reinforced primer for improved cDNA library priming.\nThe simplified protocol for DNA sequencing library preparation works by combining the reaction conditions for multiple steps. This protocol produces an amplified sequencing library from fragmented DNA using only a single master mix for a single incubation program in a standard thermal cycler. One application of the invention is called fragmentation at methylated loci and sequencing (FML-seq) and involves only three benchtop steps. Genomic DNA is digested by a methylation-dependent restriction endonuclease. Then, a unique master mix is added that combines reagents for adapter ligation, adapter loop breaking, and indexing PCR. Lastly, a single cleanup without size selection is used to purify the library. Using FML-seq, the inventors have successfully profiled DNA methylation—a crucial epigenetic mark. Compared to existing DNA methylation profiling methods, the invention enables FML-seq to reduce the risks of error, reagent costs, and especially labor time due to its short protocol. The invention is also suitable for other sequencing targets via the substitution of different enzymes and adapters.\nThe reinforced cDNA library primer* is intended to replace standard oligo(dT) primers. Many RNA sequencing approaches target the recovery of a diverse library of different reverse-transcribed complementary DNA (cDNA) molecules. They often use a short sequence of deoxythymidines (oligo(dT)) as the primer because it hybridizes to the longer tail of adenines (poly(A)) found on almost every mature non-ribosomal RNA. A downside of this approach is that every base sequence in the resulting cDNA library then includes a homopolymer of continuous dT bases, which creates a variety of problems. This invention's optimized, reinforced primer sequence alleviates those problems, reducing loss of the primer's affinity for its poly(A) target, increasing base diversity, and making it less prone to being lost or misread by the sequencer than pure oligo(dT). In optimization experiments, using the reinforced primer increased the proportion of sequence reads passing the sequencer's quality filter from 50%-60% to 80%-90%. The primer was designed by well-established technology and can be synthesized for additional applications from a different design with the same cost and ease.\n*The additional technology mentioned in this abstract refers to Stanford docket no. S22-285\n\nApplications: DNA sequencing library preparation kits for research and clinical use, DNA methylation profiling kits, Genomic sequencing kits, RNA sequencing library preparation kits for research and clinical use, such as for single-cell RNA-seq.\n\nAdvantages: Standardized storage conditions across salt solutions are safe in a standard freezer, simplifying reagent supply chain, More cost-effective and less labor-intensive compared to existing protocols, Reduces errors due to its short single-step program, Increased proportion of sequence reads that pass the sequencer's quality filter, oligo(dT) tends to be used when only a small amount of RNA is available, a specialized niche with fewer competitive products on the market.","**Summary:** The technology provides a streamlined approach for DNA and RNA sequencing library preparation by simplifying the protocol and introducing a strengthened primer for cDNA library priming. The new method combines multiple steps into a single master mix and incubation program, allowing for a rapid amplification of fragmented DNA. A notable application, FML-seq, consists of only three straightforward steps to profile DNA methylation, which enhances efficiency while minimizing errors and reducing reagent costs.

**Applications:** One significant application of this technology is FML-seq, which is designed for profiling DNA methylation. It may have broader applications in various sequencing targets by substituting different components within the simplified protocol.

**Problem Solved:** The technology addresses the challenges of prolonged labor time and throughput in DNA and RNA sequencing library preparation, making the process more efficient and cost-effective while also reducing the likelihood of errors.","Inventors at Stanford developed a simplified protocol for preparing DNA sequencing libraries and an improved primer for cDNA library priming to reduce labor time and enhance throughput.

"Stanford University","Targeting the DSIF Complex as a Therapeutic Method for Interfering with Telomere Lengthening in Cancer Cells","Docket #: S22-392","Published Application: WO2024064192","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/targeting-dsif-complex-therapeutic-method-interfering-telomere-lengthening-cancer-cells","Inherently, the telomeres located at the ends of chromosomes shorten during each cycle of DNA replication and cell division, eventually topping DNA replication and leading to cell senescence and death. Cancer cells have unlimited replication potential and evade cell senescence by preventing telomere shortening. They depend on aberrant expression of the enzyme telomerase for their ability to continue to propagate in their victims. Consequently, development of anti-cancer therapies that target telomerase has been attempted. However, success of such therapies has been limited, and this has been attributed to the slowness of attrition of nucleotide repeat sequences of telomeric DNA, and importantly, to the ability of cancer cells to develop alternative (ALT) methods of telomere elongation. The technology being marketed teaches a novel approach to telomere shortening that is accomplished by preventing RNA transcript elongation on telomeric DNA templates.\nStanford researchers have identified SUPT4H1, a component of DSIF complex as a target for preventing growth of ALT-dependent cancer cells. Inhibiting SUPT4H1's action affects transcription of TERRA, a non-coding RNA synthesized using telomeric DNA as template. Inhibiting SUPT4H1's actions reduces the ability of the RNA polymerase to produce TERRA transcripts required by ALT, leading to telomere shortening (Figure 1) and consequently to cessation of cell division. The SUPT4H1 gene and its partner in formation of the DSIF complex can be inhibited using established gene silencing methods or chemical compounds. Some such compounds have been identified and have been shown to affect the actions of SUPT4H1 and SUPT5H in vitro and in vivo.\nFigure\nStage of Development\nIn vitro data\n""""Hit"""" compounds identified\n\nApplications: Treatment of cancers by interference with telomere elongation..\n\nAdvantages: Affects ALT-dependent telomere elongation, Can be implemented using any of the established gene silencing techniques., No existing competitive product.","**Summary:** Researchers have identified the SUPT4H1 component of the DSIF complex as a viable target for therapeutic intervention in ALT-dependent cancer cells. By inhibiting the action of SUPT4H1, transcription of TERRA, a non-coding RNA essential for telomere elongation via alternative lengthening mechanisms, is disrupted. This results in diminished production of TERRA transcripts, thereby promoting telomere shortening and ultimately hindering cancer cell proliferation.

**Applications:** The technology can be applied in the development of new anti-cancer therapies aimed at treating cancers that utilize ALT for telomere maintenance. By focusing on the targeting of the DSIF complex and the inhibition of SUPT4H1, it holds potential for addressing cases where traditional telomerase-targeting therapies have shown limited efficacy.

**Problem Solved:** The approach addresses the challenge of cancer cell resistance to conventional therapies that aim to shorten telomeres by targeting telomerase. By interfering with the alternative telomere lengthening mechanism employed by cancer cells, it offers a novel strategy for inducing cell senescence and death, thereby reducing the unlimited replication potential of these cells.","Telomeres shorten during DNA replication, leading to cell senescence and death, but cancer cells evade this process by overexpressing the enzyme telomerase, allowing for unlimited replication.

While it has greatly improved the outlook for patients with liquid tumor cancer, its effectiveness against solid tumors, which account for most cancers, has been relatively low. This is because solid tumor cells release chemokines to their microenvironment to attract certain cells that exert immunosuppressive effects. Accumulation of these cells leads to immunosuppression, tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis – all of which could interfere with cancer treatment. Therefore, removing these cells from the microenvironment could help improve patient prognosis.\nThe Stanford researchers discovered an antagonist that acts on chemokine receptor found on these immunosuppressing cells and showed that such antagonist can delay tumor progression by interfering with recruitment of these immunosuppressing cells. Administration of the antagonist could be a promising treatment option for cancer patients, especially those with immunotherapy-resistant solid tumor, either as a stand-alone therapy or in conjunction with other neoadjuvant therapies. It has shown synergistic effects when combined with immunotherapy and chemotherapy.\nStage of Development\nThe inventors are conducting in vivo experiments to study the therapeutic efficacy in mice with different cancer types.\n\nApplications: Cancer treatment\n\nStand-alone treatment to delay tumor progression\nIn combination with other neoadjuvant therapies (ex.

For example, IL-11 blocking antibodies are in clinical development for pulmonary fibrosis while wild-type IL-11 is approved as a treatment for thrombocytopenia. However, stronger binders to the IL-11 receptor have the potential to be more effective treatments.\nStanford researchers therefore developed an IL-11 decoy cytokine with much higher affinity for the IL-11 receptor than the wild-type cytokine. High-throughput combinatorial screening identified mutations to IL-11 that increased its binding affinity to the IL-11 receptor 70-fold. Rresearchers identified additional mutations that converted this super-agonist to an antagonist by ablating binding to the gp130 co-receptor. Finally, they identified other mutations that enabled high-affinity binding to the mouse IL-11 receptor (~10-fold over wildtype) without affecting human IL-11 receptor binding.

Microfluidics allows precision control of fluid flow to determine parameters like nutrient delivery, mechanical stimulus, and drug delivery at the microscale level, all by using a thousand-fold smaller volume of materials compared to standard plate assays. Using the chip, users can measure how drugs of interest would act in the patient's body by using a small skin sample. As a proof of concept, the inventors utilized the platform to model antidepressant effects on the gut-brain axis. The system seeds gut organoids with patient-representative gut microbiota onto a microfluidic chip, through which the drugs can be run through. Then, the inventors measured serotonin concentration as an output indicative of gut serotonin production over the course of treatment with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). The output provided a snapshot into how different SSRIs affect the gut microbiome and gut serotonin production on a patient-specific basis, while laying the foundation for understanding variability in treatment response. Overall, the platform enables a high accuracy, high throughput, patient-centered approach for screening drug responses that increases the potential for positive therapeutic outcomes.\n\nApplications: Precision medicine, High-throughput screening assay for therapeutic compounds, Microfluidic device.\n\nAdvantages: Predicts side effect profiles for psychiatric medications, High-throughput, low-cost assay with microfluidics, Customizable to patients with skin sample.","**Summary:** This technology utilizes a microfluidic chip integrated with organoids to analyze patient-specific responses to psychotropic medications. By facilitating high-throughput screening, the system allows for precise control over fluid dynamics, enabling the evaluation of drug efficacy and side effects. The approach is demonstrated through a model that examines the effects of antidepressants on the gut-brain axis, using gut organoids seeded with patient-representative microbiota to measure changes in serotonin concentration in response to Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs).

**Applications:** The technology can be applied in personalized medicine to predict individual responses to psychiatric medications, helping to tailor treatment plans based on specific patient profiles. It can be used for research and development in pharmacology, particularly for understanding the gut-brain interaction in relation to psychotropic drugs.

Current treatments, such as eye drops, merely aim to slow disease progression without addressing the root cause. Despite the pivotal role of ONH astrocytes driving the pathogenesis of glaucoma and various optic neuropathies, there is a lack of therapeutic methods targeting this cell population in retinal disorders. Addressing this gap is crucial for developing effective targeted treatments for irreversible conditions like glaucoma and other retinal disorders.\nStanford researchers have filled this critical gap by pioneering a gene therapy solution targeting reactive astrocytes in the optic nerve for the treatment of glaucoma and other inner retinal disorders. These astrocytes, when injured, differentiate into either protective or harmful reactive astrocytes, which are controlled by cAMP. This invention specifically modulates the cAMP levels, either by increasing nuclear or depleting cytosolic cAMP, promoting the proliferation of protective astrocytes, and inhibiting harmful ones, ultimately aiding in retinal ganglion cell survival after optic nerve injury in glaucoma. By targeting specific reactive astrocyte populations and modulating compartmented cAMP, this invention marks a significant advancement in targeted gene therapy and holds promise for treating glaucoma and other inner retinal disorders.\nStage of Development:\nPre-clinical. Next steps involve continued testing in preclinical models of glaucoma, followed by large animal proof-of-concept and toxicology studies.\n\nApplications: Targeted gene therapy for glaucoma and other inner retinal disorders, Treatment of optic neuropathies, Prophylaxis of CNS disorders, Gliotherapeutics..\n\nAdvantages: No available gene therapies for glaucoma and other optic neuropathies, No therapeutic methods that target optic nerve head astrocytes for the treatment of glaucoma and inner retinal disorders.","**Summary:** Stanford researchers have developed a novel gene therapy that targets reactive astrocytes in the optic nerve head to modulate cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels.

The abnormal patterns of gene methylation found in cancer cells can enable early diagnosis, cancer type classification, prognosis assessment, and treatment monitoring. However, available methods for classifying methylation status are lacking. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing is prohibitively costly, while methylation arrays are limited by a requirement for high amounts of input DNA and poor overlap with cell-type markers critical for tumor classification. Other methods are also not suited for the fragmented DNA and low tumor cellularity found in many biopsies.\nStanford researchers therefore developed a new method for methylation classification (""""XR-methylseq"""") that is low cost, unbiased, enables tumor type classification, and suitable for low, fragmented DNA inputs (down to 250 pg). DNA fragments are ligated to an adapter, digested with a restriction enzyme at CCGG motifs, and ligated to a second adapter. Fragments are enzymatically converted to distinguish methylation status and only fragments with both adapters are amplified and sequenced. Researchers demonstrated that this technique can accurately classify CNS tumors from CSF, which is not possible using other methods due to the low DNA content and tumor cellularity found in CSF.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept: XR-methylseq enables tumor classification from CSF\n\nApplications: Analysis of both solid and liquid biopsies (e.g., urine, CSF, biopsy supernatant), Diagnosis and classification of cancer, Early cancer detection, Prediction of cancer prognosis, Personalized cancer treatment, Minimal residual disease testing, Monitoring of treatment response and resistance, Basic research into methylation profiles.\n\nAdvantages: Overlaps with cell type markers to enable tumor classification, Uses enzymatic digestion instead of harsh bisulfite chemistries that break DNA, Works with low DNA inputs (250 pg) and low tumor cellularity, Low cost, Works with fragmented DNA often seen in biopsies, Highly correlated with WGBS gold standard (not biased), 95%+ on-target rate, leading to an 18-fold enrichment at CCGG flanks.","**Summary:** Stanford researchers have developed a cost-effective method for tumor methylation profiling that allows for tumor classification using low amounts of fragmented DNA typical in liquid biopsies. This method, known as ""XR-methylseq,"" effectively addresses the limitations of existing techniques, such as whole genome bisulfite sequencing and methylation arrays, which require high DNA inputs and are not adaptable to the low tumor cellularity often present in biopsies.

Despite a plethora of clinical options and an enormous consumer market for scar treatment; no current therapeutic strategy prevents or reverses this fibrotic process. Inventors at Stanford developed a novel method of use of Piezo1 and Piezo2 inhibitors in the prevention of skin scarring. Piezo channels are mechanosensitive ion channels that mediate stretch sensation. Piezo1 and Piezo2 inhibitors inhibit cellular mechanical signaling, an important contributor to scarring and fibrosis. Using a mouse model of wound healing, we find that a single dose of piezo1 or piezo2 treatment (local injection) reduces scarring and fibrosis, specifically via adipocytes as they are mechanically sensitive. Aside from physically offloading wound tension through specialized wound dressings, no effective therapy for skin scarring exists. No targeted molecular agents have been able to reduce scar burden while not comprising or delaying wound repair. The novel method not only reduces scarring, but also improves scar appearance and allows for regrowth of skin elements such as hair follicles and sweat glands (absent in scars), which are highly significant outcomes for patients suffering from skin scarring.\n\nApplications: Scar prevention in the skin, Inhibition of mechanical sensing in adipocytes, Treatment of organ fibrosis.\n\nAdvantages: Currently, there is no effective drug that can overcome skin fibrosis in the skin.

Immunotherapy using CAR-T cells relies on T cell receptor (TCR) signaling to activate the cells that will mediate potent antitumor or anti-infective effects. However, over time, chronic signaling through the endogenous TCR or CAR can induce a dysfunctional state called """"T cell exhaustion"""", reducing the overall effectiveness of therapy. Moreover, CARs are prone to antigen independent signaling in vitro and in vivo, further underscoring the need to modulate CAR signaling to preserve CAR T function.

However, genetic data poorly reports on the proteins in a cell, as post-transcriptional modifications critical to cellular function (e.g., protein phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination) are not encoded in mRNA, and mRNA levels are often poorly predictive of protein levels. Despite this, robust methods for identifying and quantifying the proteins in a cell are lacking. Current mass spectrometry approaches can only identify a small fraction of all the proteins in a cell, while emerging approaches such as nanopore and real-time dynamic protein sequencing suffer from poor generalizability, throughput, and sensitivity.\nResearchers therefore developed a new protein sequencing method that combines the well-established technologies of Edman degradation and high-throughput DNA sequencing. Briefly, one amino acid at a time is removed from the end of each protein and barcoded with DNA that are specific to the protein molecule. The DNA barcoded amino acid derivatives are recognized by an antibody specific for that amino acid. Importantly, such antibodies can also recognize specific post-translational modifications. DNA barcodes associated with each antibody encode the identity of the amino acid, the protein it came from, and its location in the protein.

By combining this surgery technique with targeted delivery of specific growth factors (e.g. BMP2 and VEGFR1) to the site of tissue degeneration, they were able to stimulate skeletal stem cells to regenerate cartilage. This process involves both mechanical stimulation from the surgery and biochemical stimulation from the growth factors to encourage stem cells to transform into cartilage.\nOsteoarthritis is a degenerative disease that results in irreversible and progressive loss of cartilage lining joints and is the most common form of musculoskeletal disorder. Currently, surgeons commonly use the microfracture surgery technique in an attempt to regenerate cartilage in osteoarthritis. But, although the surgery results in 'fibrocartilage' that provides some symptomatic relief, the mechanical properties compared with normal articular cartilage are significantly reduced.

In the early stages, the plaques are rich in lipids and can be treated with medication and lifestyle changes. However, as they mature beyond the lipid-rich phase, a subset of activated T-cells within the plaques expresses the pro-fibrotic protein AREG. This protein promotes smooth muscle cell proliferation and fibrosis, leading to advancement of lesions into irreversible advanced-stage plaques, such as fibroatheroma. Fibroatheroma is a major precursor to plaque rupture that could lead to life-threatening acute cardiac syndromes.\nTo prevent the development of fibroatheromas, Stanford researchers have devised a nanobody-based platform that blocks the attachment of AREG to atherosclerotic plaque lesions, hindering disease progression. The nanobody is a bispecific protein with two immunoglobulin single variable (ISV) domains: one ISV domain binds to AREG and the other domain interferes with vascular smooth muscle cells activity. This nanobody-based platform targeting the root cause of fibroatheroma development could revolutionize treatment strategies for patients with coronary artery disease.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Atherosclerosis treatment.\n\nAdvantages: Specifically targets development of fibroatheromas, which cannot be mitigated with current treatments.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford have developed a nanobody-based platform that targets amphiregulin (AREG) to block its activity, potentially preventing the progression of early-stage atherosclerotic plaques into advanced fibroatheromas.

Its primary disadvantage is that this ionizing radiation can be harmful to the patients and healthcare providers that are exposed. Unfortunately, to have a high enough sensitivity to observe subtle absorption/transmission differences in the sample requires enough high X-ray photon doses which in many cases is enough radiation to be damaging.\nThe method invented here lowers the amount of radiation required by using Compton scattering through a thin carbon target with a pulsed X-ray source to produce an X-ray and an electron which are measured in coincidence. Because the electron and photon are entangled, the detection of the electron means the X-ray photon exists. This quantum concept changes the statistics of the detection allowing a reduction of the number photons required to detect the same absorption/transmission difference from 10,000 photon/pixel to 100 photons/pixel for a 1% difference (2-3 orders of magnitude improvement).\nStage of Development: Concept\n\nApplications: Diagnostic imaging by X-ray and CT.\n\nAdvantages: Reduces X-ray dose 2-3 orders of magnitude for medical image, Improves imaging sensitivity for a given dose.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford have developed a method that allows X-ray and CT imaging to achieve the same signal with significantly reduced X-ray dosage, enabling a safer imaging process. Traditional X-ray imaging requires a high photon dose to achieve adequate sensitivity, which can be harmful to patients and healthcare providers due to the ionizing radiation. The new method utilizes Compton scattering through a thin carbon target with a pulsed X-ray source, producing entangled X-ray photons and electrons that enhance detection efficiency. This technique reduces the number of X-ray photons needed for sensitive detection from 10,000 to just 100 photons per pixel to identify a 1% difference.

**Applications:** The technology is applicable in diagnostic imaging using X-ray and CT methods, potentially enhancing patient safety and image quality within the healthcare sector.

**Problem Solved:** The technology addresses the issue of harmful radiation exposure associated with traditional X-ray imaging by significantly lowering the required dosage while improving the sensitivity of the images obtained.","Stanford researchers have developed a method that enables X-ray and CT imaging to achieve equivalent signal levels while using two to three orders of magnitude less X-ray dosage.

Developing bispecific antibodies to target cancer cells for phagocytosis can be an innovative method to help eliminate tumors and treat various cancers, such as lymphoma and leukemia.\nThe interaction between CD47 and SIRPα transmits a """"don't eat me signal"""" that inhibits phagocytosis as a mechanism for the immune system to identify self from non-self. Cancer cells commonly overexpress CD47 to take advantage of this signal and avoid elimination by phagocytosis. Efforts to block CD47 using recombinant variants of SIRPα have been explored as a therapeutic approach to promote the elimination of tumor cells. However, CD47 expression on normal cells serves as an 'antigen sink,' which reduces the efficacy of CD47 blockade and potentially leads to toxicity due to their phagocytosis. Previous studies have shown that therapeutic antibodies that bind tumor antigens to induce phagocytosis are synergistic with CD47 blockage, suggesting that a bifunctional protein that performs these two functions can be a viable option for specifically and efficiently inducing phagocytosis of cancer cells.\nBispecific antibodies designed by the Stanford researchers have low affinity for CD47, rendering them unable to bind normal cells expressing CD47 alone, and high affinity for the tumor antigen CD20, demonstrating selective binding to CD20/CD47 dual antigen-expressing tumor cells. Importantly, the treatment using these bispecific antibodies in mice transplanted or transfused with cancer cells resulted in a significant extension of their survival and depleted target cells in non-human primates with no observed toxicity. Consequently, bispecific antibodies have the potential to improve cancer treatments by targeting tumor cells for phagocytic elimination in patients.\nFigure:\nFigure Description: A schematic showcasing the design of the CD20/CD47 bispecific antibodies.\nStage of Development:\nPreclinical – in-vivo\n\nApplications: Development of bispecific antibodies to treat cancer, Elimination of cancer cells in lymphoma and leukemia, Increasing the efficacy of CD47 blockage by targeting cancer cells for phagocytosis.\n\nAdvantages: Synergizes CD47 blockade with binding to tumor antigens and induction of phagocytosis, Versatile method that can accommodate the targeting of a plethora of tumor antigens, Function is confined to a single, bispecific antibody which simplifies formulations.","**Summary:** Stanford scientists have developed bispecific antibodies that can target cancer cells and effectively disrupt the CD47-SIRPα ""don't eat me signal,"" facilitating the clearance of tumors with minimal toxicity. This innovative approach aims to promote phagocytosis of cancer cells, particularly in cancers such as lymphoma and leukemia. The antibodies selectively bind to CD20, a tumor antigen, while maintaining a low affinity for CD47, which helps prevent binding to normal cells and mitigates the risk of toxicity. 

**Applications:** The bispecific antibodies can potentially be used to treat various forms of cancer, including lymphoma and leukemia. Their mechanism of action could enhance the effectiveness of cancer therapies by promoting the immune system's ability to remove malignant cells without harming healthy tissue.

**Problem Solved:** The technology addresses the challenge posed by cancer cells that overexpress CD47, allowing them to evade phagocytosis and avoid immune system detection. By blocking the inhibitory signal while promoting targeting of tumor antigens, these bispecific antibodies enable the immune system to effectively eliminate cancerous cells, overcoming the limitations of traditional CD47 blockade strategies that can inadvertently affect normal cells.","Stanford scientists have found that bispecific antibodies can selectively bind to cancer cells and block the CD47-SIRPα ""don't eat me signal,"" enabling efficient tumor clearance with minimal toxicity.

These include engineering regulatable chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) as well as identifying a group of small molecules that can modulate or inhibit TCR signaling. Immunotherapy using CAR-T cells relies on endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) signaling which is responsible for optimal T cell activation and potent antitumor or anti-infective effects. However, continuous activation of CAR T cells can result in a dysfunctional state called """"T cell exhaustion"""", reducing the overall effectiveness of therapy. To address this overstimulation problem, the inventors genetically engineered a regulatable CAR by attaching a protein domain that allows for control over CAR surface expression via addition of an FDA-approved small molecule drug. This system is designed such that CAR T cells can undergo temporary periods of rest during which the CAR T cell ceases to signal, thus mitigating T cell exhaustion and restoring therapeutic efficacy. In addition, the inventors showed that certain small molecules that inhibit protein kinases can also address the overstimulation problem through transient inhibition of TCR signaling. Both inventions have applications in basic research or immunotherapy for infectious disease or cancer.\nStage of Development - Proof of Concept\nThe inventors have established an animal model of regulating CAR surface expression and demonstrated proof-of-concept for the engineered regulatable CAR system in vitro and in vivo:\nThe inventors also used a known, FDA-approved drug to demonstrate the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on reversing T cell exhaustion and augmenting T cell function in vivo.

The most obvious application of these technologies is cancer treatment by eliminating malignant cells while sparing healthy ones, but other applications include treatments for infectious disease or elimination of specific immune cells. Outside of the clinic, researchers rely on selective cytotoxicity to conduct functional genomic screens or directed evolution campaigns.\nThe gold standard approach today is the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). ADCs are comprised of antibodies, which can bind a target antigen with exquisitely high affinity and selectivity. Cells that lack the antigen have much lower exposure to the delivered drug, which reduces side-effects and increases the therapeutic window of these molecules. While a significant advancement, ADCs are far from perfect. Numerous suitable antigens to target with ADC therapy have proven exceptionally difficult to identify. As such, there is a need to develop additional methods of selection that can better distinguish the subtle differences between target and bystander cells.\nThe Bertozzi group at Stanford University has created a lectin-drug conjugate (LDC) as an alternative strategy for selective cytotoxicity. Lectins are proteins that selectively interact with glycoproteins or glycolipids, proving to be useful to distinguish cancer cells that have altered glycosylation from healthy ones.

Furthermore, it has potential uses in research settings, particularly in functional genomic screening and directed evolution campaigns.

**Problem Solved:** LDCs address the challenge faced by ADCs, which often struggle to identify suitable target antigens. By employing lectins, which have a unique binding capability to specific carbohydrates on cell surfaces, LDCs may provide a more refined approach to selectively target and eliminate cells, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes and reducing side effects associated with current treatments.","Selective cytotoxicity is a crucial technology used primarily in cancer treatment to eliminate malignant cells while preserving healthy ones, and it is also applicable in treating infectious diseases and targeting specific immune cells.

This binder can be conjugated to a variety of payloads, including an anti-immune checkpoint protein antibody for more selective immune checkpoint blockade.\nImmune checkpoint proteins expressed on the surface of immune cells inhibit their activity and prevent excessive immune responses. In cancer, the overactivation of these proteins can prevent the immune system from killing cancer cells. Antibodies that re-activate the immune system by blocking checkpoint proteins (""""checkpoint blockade"""") can therefore treat a wide variety of cancers. However, these drugs can cause dangerous side effects by also activating healthy immune cells, causing the immune system to attack both cancer and healthy tissues.\nStanford researchers therefore invented a new class of checkpoint inhibitors that selectively act on immune cells involved in cancer. These molecules comprise a novel binder for CD206, a marker expressed on tumor-associated macrophages (""""TAMs,"""" immune cells that contribute to cancer progression) conjugated to an antibody that binds but does not inhibit a checkpoint protein. When this molecule binds to a TAM, the cell internalizes and destroys the immune checkpoint proteins on its surface, allowing it to kill cancer cells. These molecules can also destroy soluble immune cell signaling proteins such as cytokines involved in cancer progression. The CD206 binder can also be conjugated to other payloads, such as siRNA, cytotoxic drugs, or imaging agents.\nStage of Development\nIn vitro: selective binding to TAMs and depletion of immune checkpoint proteins and cytokines in macrophage cell lines\n\nApplications: Targeted cancer immunotherapy, Antibodies for imaging tumor-associated macrophages, siRNA conjugates for delivery to tumor-associated macrophages, ADCs for delivery of cytotoxic drugs to tumor-associated macrophages.\n\nAdvantages: Better binding and easier to synthesize than prior, polymeric CD206 binders, CD206 binder can be conjugated to a variety of payloads, More selective and less toxic than traditional checkpoint inhibitors, Platform technology for targeted cancer immunotherapy, Degradation of both cell-surface (i.e., ICAM-1) and soluble (i.e., IL-4) proteins involved in cancer progression, More selective and easier to synthesize than prior tumor-associated macrophage binders.","**Summary:** Stanford scientists have developed an improved binder targeting CD206, a marker expressed on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).

"Stanford University","Enrichment of clinically relevant cell types using receptors","Docket #: S22-133","Published Application: WO2024086518","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/enrichment-clinically-relevant-cell-types-using-receptors","Introduction: Blood cell transfusion plays a vital role in modern medicine–supporting surgery, obstetrics, trauma care, and cancer chemotherapy. In the US alone, more than 12 million red-cell units are consumed annually. However, the availability is contingent on donor material, resulting in supply constraints and safety concerns. Globally, shortages pose a significant healthcare challenge, expected to worsen with aging populations and diminishing donor numbers. To address these growing medical needs, ex vivo manufacture of red blood cells (RBCs) from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) producer lines emerges as a renewable and scalable solution that offer potential benefits compared to donor blood, including a lower risk of infectious disease transmission, streamlined production, product uniformity, and ability to source or genetically engineer antigen-negative cells. However, this approach remains extremely costly, owing in large part to purified, clinical-grade recombinant cytokines required to stimulate producer cells for expansion and differentiation into erythroid cells. Because erythropoietin (EPO) signaling through the EPO receptor (EPOR) is indispensable to RBC development, of all components in erythroid-promoting media, EPO is by far the most costly.\nMethods: We used the latest synthetic biology tools and genome engineering technologies to de-couple EPOR signaling from the EPO cytokine. Specifically, we devised a series of FKBP-EPOR chimeras that exchanged the requirement for native EPO ligand with an exogenous, orthogonal rapalog small molecule (SM) which we termed inducible EPORs (iEPORs). These were site-specifically inserted in vitro into primary human hematopoietic cells (HSCs) via CRISPR/AAV-mediated genome editing at various HSC and RBC-relevant loci (CCR5 with the PGK and SFFV promoters, EPOR, and HBA1). Using flow cytometry and ddPCR-based assays, we determined the fidelity (i.e., responsivity to SM) and potency (ability to drive differentiation from a stem cell state towards the erythroid lineage) of various iEPOR constructs (different signal peptides and extracellular and intracellular domain modifications) as well as the impact of inserting these chimeras at the aforementioned loci.\nResults & Discussion: We first optimized iEPOR constructs through a highly effective signal peptide present on IL6 and inclusion of the naturally occurring intracellular domain truncation known to enhance erythropoiesis. Together, these modifications allowed us to drive HSCs to 100% differentiation into RBCs in the presence of the iEPOR-dimerizing small molecule. However, we also observed 26.2% differentiation in the absence of any endogenous or exogenous erythroid-biasing ligand. To increase the fidelity of our iEPOR, we integrated our iEPOR at the CCR5 locus and drove expression using the PGK promoter to ablate ligand-independent differentiation (Figure 1A). This identical HSC response to iEPOR in the presence of our small molecule versus native HSC in the presence of EPO was corroborated not only by flow cytometry-based markers of erythroid differentiation but also via HPLC-based assessment of hemoglobin A and F production. iEPOR-integrated HSCs differentiated as described clustered with natively differentiated HSCs vs undifferentiated HSCs by PCA covariance plots and differential gene expression heatmaps (Figure 1B). We observed effectively identical counts of hemoglobin RNA supporting our HPLC findings. Finally, we integrated our optimized iEPOR construct into an iPSC line and devised a consolidated, differentiation strategy from induced pluripotent stem cells to HSCs and, ultimately, RBCs (Figure 1C). Together, this proves our approach serves an ex vivo, EPO-independent RBC production strategy that closely mimics native EPOR signaling by surface biomarkers, relevant protein output, and transcriptional profile. By our calculation, 1nM of dimerizer is approximately 500-fold less costly than 3U/mL of EPO cytokine. This would therefore reduce the cost of EPO cytokine required to generate a single unit of RBCs from $2,760 to approximately $6. Given that dependence on costly cytokines is a common barrier to production of cell-based therapeutics, in the future we believe the strategies defined in this work may enable scalable and renewable ex vivo production of a wide variety of clinically relevant cell types including platelets, neutrophils, T cells.\nStage of Development\nResearch – in vivo\nRelated Technologies\nS21-196: Differential Proliferation of Human HSPCs Using Truncated Erythropoietin Receptors\nS21-175: Potential Curative Treatment for Alpha-Thalassemia Using CRISPR-Mediated Genome Editing\n\nApplications: Hemoglobinopathies.\n\nAdvantages: Greater efficacy by inducing bias in transplanted HSC to yield higher RBC production., Lower toxic and mutagenic regimens are required to stimulate high RBC production., Easy integration into current treatment workflow..","**Summary:** This technology focuses on enhancing the generation of red blood cells (RBCs) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to address the growing demand for blood transfusions. The process aims to circumvent the limitations associated with donor material, such as supply constraints and safety issues, especially as donor numbers decline in aging populations. Current methods of producing RBCs ex vivo face high costs primarily due to the need for clinical-grade recombinant cytokines, particularly erythropoietin (EPO), which is crucial for RBC development.

One of the most well-established techniques for nanoscale 3D fabrication is two-photon polymerization (2PP). However, 2PP is slow and expensive, because it uses high-powered lasers that allow for only monovoxel printing per light source.\nResearchers at Stanford have proposed TTA-UC, which uses lower power sources, as an alternative to 2PP. Materials involved in this process contain a sensitizer-annihilator pair, a photoinitiator, and monomers. The sensitizer absorbs lower energy photons to make the annihilator emits higher-energy photons. The photoinitiator then triggers the assembly of the monomers, or polymerization by absorbing the upconverted photons. The researchers have identified a resin with an ideal ratio of appropriate components for TTA-UC. They then demonstrated that TTA-UC can be parallelized by incorporating a digital micromirror device to project millions of voxels simultaneously.

"Stanford University","The use of mechanotransduction inhibitors as a coating for surgical sutures to reduce scarring","Docket #: S23-082","Published Application: WO2024191790","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/use-mechanotransduction-inhibitors-coating-surgical-sutures-reduce-scarring","Researchers at Stanford have proposed that coating surgical sutures with mechanotransduction inhibitors may reduce scarring of the tissue.\nWhen the skin or other tissues are wounded, the body initiates a healing process. While shallow wounds may heal without a scar, injuries involving thicker tissues, such as the dermis or fascia, often lead to visible scars characterized by abnormal color, contour, rugosity, and breaking strength. Over time, scars may improve in appearance and breaking strength as collagen structures remodel and blood vessels form. However, these characteristics will never fully match those of normal (unwounded) skin, and certain functional elements like hair follicles and sweat glands do not regenerate, resulting in permanent functional losses. Currently, there is no therapeutic strategy to either prevent or reverse scarring.\nUpon learning that the primary pathway responsible for scar formation is mechanotransduction, Stanford researchers studied the impact of mechanotransduction inhibitors on fibrosis. Inhibitors targeting proteins such as Focal Adhesion Kinase, Yes Associated Protein, Piezo1 and Piezo2 effectively reduced scarring, restoring both appearance and full function. Surgical sutures, used to close open tissues or attach medical devices, present a promising avenue for scar prevention. Coating sutures with any or combinations of the mechanotransduction inhibitors could reduce future scarring. Also, these sutures could be used in scar revision surgeries to reverse scarring.\nStage of Development\nPrototype\n\nApplications: Skin wounds (ex. Incisional wounds or burns), Postpartum recovery, Surgeries involving joining tissues, Medical device implant, Laparotomy surgery, Scar revision surgery, Organ fibrosis, Pathological skin scarring conditions (Dupuytren's disease, fibrotic dermal scarring, hypertrophic scarring, keloid scarring, corneal and other ocular tissue scarring).\n\nAdvantages: Capable of both preventing and reversing scarring, Can be combined with active agents (antimicrobial, antibiotic, or antiseptic) to improve the prognosis, Simple fabrication process, making it scalable.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford have proposed that the application of mechanotransduction inhibitors onto surgical sutures may effectively reduce tissue scarring during the healing process. Scarring occurs primarily in deeper tissues due to the body's natural healing mechanisms, which often result in scars that differ in color, texture, and structural integrity from uninjured skin. Though scars can improve over time, they rarely return to their original state, and critical features such as hair follicles and sweat glands do not regenerate. By focusing on the mechanotransduction pathways crucial to scar formation, researchers found that specific inhibitors targeting proteins like Focal Adhesion Kinase, Yes Associated Protein, and Piezo channels can diminish scarring while restoring the appearance and functionality of the tissue.

**Applications:** The technology can be applied through the coating of surgical sutures with mechanotransduction inhibitors, offering potential benefits in standard surgical procedures and revision surgeries where scarring is a concern. These specially coated sutures may not only reduce scarring in new wounds but could also be beneficial in improving outcomes following scar revisions.

**Problem Solved:** This approach addresses the lack of effective therapeutic strategies currently available to prevent or reverse scarring from surgical wounds or injuries to deeper skin layers. By minimizing the extent of scarring through the inhibition of mechanotransduction pathways, the technology has the potential to significantly improve the healing outcomes, appearance, and function of scarred tissues.","Researchers at Stanford propose that using mechanotransduction inhibitors as coatings for surgical sutures may help reduce scarring in tissue healing. Scarring often occurs in deeper tissue injuries, leading to noticeable changes in color, contour, and strength."

Instead of treating the salt as waste, electrochemical technology can be employed to regenerate acid and base from the salt and water. Current state of the art technology, bipolar membrane (BPM) electrodialysis, is not very efficient or durable for splitting water into protons and hydroxide.To address this issue, Stanford researcher have invented the bipolar electrode (BPE) comprising two catalyst layers surrounding a gas-transporting layer. One catalyst generates a gaseous product (e.g., hydrogen), transported to the other layer for oxidation, resulting in separate streams of protons and hydroxide ions. The BPE's performance scalability depends on thermodynamic potentials and electrocatalyst effectiveness, and its design prevents parasitic ion crossover, eliminating the need for ion-exchange membranes, presenting significant advantages over BPMs.\nStage of Development \nPrototype: small bench-top prototype built\n\nApplications: Production and recovery of organic acids and bases, Purification of mineral ores, Production of cementitious materials.\n\nAdvantages: In comparison to gold standard BPE:, Total blockage of ion crossover, Lower overpotential, Increased energy efficiency, increases throughput and reduces capital cost, Easier manufacturing, Greater durability, Low cost.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford have developed a novel bipolar electrode (BPE) that serves as a replacement for traditional bipolar membrane (BPM) electrodialysis, providing a more efficient and cost-effective method to split water into protons and hydroxide ions. The BPE features two catalyst layers encasing a gas-transporting layer, where one catalyst produces a gaseous product such as hydrogen, which is then transported for oxidation in the other layer. This configuration improves the separation of ions and mitigates inefficiencies associated with BPMs, including parasitic ion crossover, thus negating the need for ion-exchange membranes. A small bench-top prototype has been constructed, suggesting that the technology is at an early stage of development.

**Applications:** The applications for this technology include the production and recovery of organic acids and bases, the purification of mineral ores, and the production of cementitious materials.

These protein degraders can be used to promote the degradation of integrins, which have implications in several fibrotic diseases, and serve as a highly effective therapeutic for patients suffering from fibrosis.\nOrgan fibrosis is characterized by excessive deposition and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), which ultimately disrupt normal tissue architecture and functions. For example, renal fibrosis affects 800 million people worldwide and dialysis treatment is becoming a significant economic burden. As the principal ECM receptor, integrins are implicated in diverse fibrotic diseases such as renal fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, and scleroderma fibrosis. Despite the tremendous interest, the development of inhibitors focusing on integrins has faced substantial challenges such as low in vivo efficacy, undesired effects, lack of tissue specificity, and integrin subtype specificity.\nProtein degraders of integrins have resulted in the first known class of integrin inactivators that induce degradation of a cell-surface integrin via lysosomal targeting instead of simply blocking integrin activity. Importantly, targeting integrins in this manner addresses the four key challenges mentioned in the previous paragraph. Consequently, inducing degradation of integrins can drastically improve fibrosis treatment efficacy and transform the fibrotic disease medical field.\nStage of Development\nProof of Concept\n\nApplications: Induced degradation of integrins associated with fibrosis, Treatment of fibrotic diseases.\n\nAdvantages: Limits undesired effects associated with direct binding of integrins, Enhanced tissue specificity and subtype selectivity.","**Summary:** Stanford scientists have developed protein degraders that facilitate the lysosomal degradation of extracellular cargo, particularly focusing on integrins, which are critical in various fibrotic diseases. These degraders address the challenges faced by traditional integrin inhibitors, such as low in vivo efficacy and lack of tissue specificity, by promoting the degradation of integrins rather than merely blocking their activity. This innovative approach is particularly relevant for treating conditions characterized by excess extracellular matrix deposition.

**Applications:** The technology can be utilized as a therapeutic strategy for a range of fibrotic diseases, including renal fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, and scleroderma fibrosis. Given the global prevalence of renal fibrosis and the associated economic burden of dialysis treatment, these degraders may significantly enhance treatment outcomes for patients suffering from various forms of fibrosis.

**Problem Solved:** The protein degraders resolve critical issues encountered with existing integrin inhibitors, such as inadequate efficacy in vivo, undesired side effects, and difficulties related to targeting specific tissues and integrin subtypes. By promoting the actual degradation of integrins, this technology offers a more effective means of mitigating fibrosis-related conditions, improving therapeutic efficacy overall.","Stanford scientists have developed protein degraders that facilitate lysosomal degradation of integrins, which are implicated in fibrotic diseases.

This implant leverages a specialized delivery system into the suprachoroidal space, and effectively lowers the intraocular pressure (IOP).\nElevated IOP is a major risk factor for glaucoma, which is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. While there are several methods to reduce IOP, each approach has inherent limitations. Daily eyedrop administration can be compromised by patient medication adherence and limited tolerability; laser procedures are not adequately effective for many patients; current surgical procedures damage the conjunctiva and are ultimately compromised by scarring; and sustained-release drug-loaded implants may damage the anterior chamber and in any case only last months.\nAs a promising alternative, Stanford researchers have developed a suprachoroidal implant effective at lowering IOP.

However, the use of rAAV is limited by its immunogenicity, which can result in reduced therapeutic efficacy as well as dangerous and even deadly reactions in patients. While rAAV engineering promises less immunogenic vectors, these efforts are hindered by a lack of tools for predicting immunogenicity pre-clinically. Animal models have very different immune systems from humans, while cell-based models are non-physiological and display poor immune responses to rAAV. Assays employing human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are similarly limited by wide variability between donors and low sensitivity.\nTo address this challenge, Stanford researchers developed a new tool for predicting innate immune responses to rAAV. rAAV capsids are first opsonized (tagged for recognition by the immune system) with an anti-AAV monoclonal antibody and then incubated with human PBMCs. PBMC immune activation can be measured by cytokine production or the expression of T-cell activation markers. Researchers showed that opsonization enabled immune responses from otherwise unresponsive PBMCs and discrimination between closely related but differentially immunogenic rAAVs.\nStage of Development\nIn vitro: assay elicits an rAAV-induced immune response in otherwise unresponsive PBMCs that increases with exposure to unmethylated CpGs\n\nApplications: Tools for rAAV research, Clinical development of rAAV-mediated vaccines and gene therapies, Validation of lot-to-lot rAAV consistency during manufacturing, Basis for human subject inclusion or exclusion in rAAV clinical trials, Companion diagnostic for evaluating patient suitability for rAAV gene therapies.\n\nAdvantages: High sensitivity, Simple, in vitro assay, Distinguishes immune responses towards closely related rAAV vectors, Predicts immune responses without the need for animal models, Overcomes issues with variability between PBMC donors.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford have created a high-sensitivity cell-based assay that effectively predicts the innate immune response to recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). This innovation stems from the need to overcome the immunogenicity of rAAV, which can lead to compromised therapeutic efficacy and adverse reactions in patients receiving gene therapies for conditions such as spinal muscular atrophy and hemophilia B. Current predictive tools for immunogenicity are inadequate due to differences between human and animal immune systems, as well as variability in human donor responses. The new assay utilizes opsonized rAAV capsids with specific antibodies and incubates them with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), allowing for the measurement of immune activation through cytokine production or T-cell activation markers, thereby enhancing sensitivity and consistency in results.

A recent systems-level analysis emphasizes that carbon footprint due to N2O emissions is more significant than the footprint resulting from energy use. Anaerobic secondary treatment has been proposed to enable energy-efficient removal of organic matter but will have similar N2O emissions in a post-treatment for biological nitrogen removal. A method for N2O emission control is clearly needed.\nTo address this, Stanford researchers developed a novel strategy where a membrane-aerated bioreactor (MABR) is incorporated for both aerobic secondary treatment and tertiary treatment after anaerobic secondary treatment to recover N2O produced during biological nitrogen treatment. Biofilm attached to gas permeable membrane surfaces in the MABR effectively remove biodegradable compounds from the aqueous phase, enabling low energy consumption. The biofilms also create a driving force for counter diffusion of N2O from the membrane-attached biofilm into the lumen of the membranes. This driving force increases N2O concentration within the lumen, facilitating recovery of N2O-enriched off-gas and minimization in carbon footprint. The N2O-enriched off-gas can be used for energy production in a biogas engine or in a system that recovers combined heat and power (CHP).\nStage of Development\nPilot: treatment of 4,320 gallons of secondary effluent per day at the Silicon Valley Clean Water wastewater treatment facility, enabling recovery of > 99% N2O with a low energy requirement ( 0.06 kWh/m3)\n\nApplications: Wastewater treatment.\n\nAdvantages: Simple, single-step process, Enables reduction in > 90% greenhouse gas emissions, Low energy requirement due to highly efficient aeration, Improved versatility and reliability of wastewater treatment.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford have developed a membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) design aimed at improving secondary wastewater treatment by simultaneously removing pollutants and recovering N2O emissions.

"Stanford University","Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Management of Enteric Diseases","Docket #: S07-230","Published Application: WO2009035510, Published Application: 20110027891, Issued: 8,535,946 (USA)","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/biomarkers-diagnosis-and-management-enteric-diseases","There is an urgent need for the development of sensitive, specific and non-invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of patients with enteropathic diseases such as celiac sprue. Such biomarkers could be used in primary screening of potential patients, definitive diagnosis of suspected patients, monitoring response to therapies, drug compliance assessment, and cost-effective drug development. Two such biomarkers, summarized below, have been invented and patented at Stanford University. For simplicity, the descriptions that follow are limited to their relevance to celiac sprue, although application to other enteric diseases (e.g. inflammatory bowel diseases) is also anticipated.\nBackground:\nCurrent diagnostic methods for celiac sprue are based on serum antibody tests, a small bowel biopsy, and a clinical response to a gluten-free diet. Although antibody tests are fairly specific, patients must be exposed to the discomfort of high doses of gluten over extended durations before they seroconvert. Whereas small bowel biopsies are the """"gold standard"""", they are obtained via invasive and expensive endoscopic procedures; their handling and examination requires considerable expertise and is often subjective. Clinical signs and symptoms associated with celiac sprue are variable, even in the same patient, and therefore not particularly useful. For example, although patients with active celiac sprue show statistically significant differences in fat or xylose absorption or lactulose permeability compared to patients in remission, these markers are peripherally related to celiac sprue immunopathogenesis, and can undergo significant changes due to factors unrelated to the disease. There is therefore an urgent need for biomarkers that complement the strengths and weaknesses of serological and histological tests in the context of diagnosis.\nAlthough a definitive path for celiac sprue drug development has not been established, ongoing efforts are based on clinical protocols that are adapted from existing diagnostic practices. For example, changes in histology, serology, fat or xylose absorption, lactulose permeability, and gastrointestinal symptoms are generally monitored either in the context of a gluten challenge (if the protective capacity of the drug candidate is being evaluated) or along the normal course of recovery (if the ability of the drug candidate to accelerate full recovery is being evaluated). There is an urgent need for """"scaleable biomarkers"""" that can serve as useful, preferably primary, endpoints in early proof-of-concept clinical trials as well as late-stage registration trials.\nOn a longer-term horizon, as new drugs for celiac sprue are approved, one can anticipate a need for biomarkers that facilitate assessment of compliance and response to therapy. Not only would this enhance the physician's ability to manage the patient's life-long disease, but it would also add value to selected drugs in an increasingly competitive market.\nThe Technologies:\n\nApplications: Biomarkers for diagnosis and drug development for celiac disease, and potentially other enteric diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nAdvantages: Large potential impact - 1 in 200 people are affected by celiac disease, Less invasive than bowel biopsy, Complements existing histological & serological tests.","**Summary:** There is a critical demand for the creation of non-invasive, sensitive, and specific biomarkers to aid the diagnosis and management of enteropathic diseases, particularly celiac sprue. Current diagnostic approaches rely heavily on serum antibody tests, invasive small bowel biopsies, and subjective clinical assessments, which often require patients to endure gluten exposure for optimal testing outcomes. The invention and patenting of two biomarkers at Stanford University aim to offer a more reliable and comfortable diagnostic alternative while also holding potential applicability to other enteric diseases.

**Applications:** The proposed biomarkers can be utilized for various purposes, including primary screening of at-risk individuals, providing definitive diagnoses for suspected cases of celiac sprue, monitoring therapeutic responses, assessing drug compliance, and facilitating cost-effective drug development, thereby enhancing patient management and outcomes.

**Problem Solved:** The technology addresses the limitations of current diagnostic methods, which are often invasive, expensive, and subjective. By providing non-invasive biomarkers, patients will experience less discomfort and anxiety, leading to improved access to timely diagnosis and management of enteropathic diseases.","There is an urgent need for sensitive, specific, and non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosing and managing enteropathic diseases like celiac sprue.

The efficacy of the current seasonal influenza vaccine is typically ranges from 19% to 60%. We identified that the low efficacy is due to the phenomenon of subtype bias, which arises from limited CD4+ T cell 'help' across all strains. That is, even though the vaccine contains multiple strains, most individuals elicit a robust immune response to only one of the strains. This leaves individuals vulnerable to infection by other strains. Subtype bias occurs in approximately 65% of the vaccinated individuals which suggests that eliminating it may be a valid path to increase vaccine efficacy.\nStanford scientists have discovered that coupling of antigens from multiple influenza strains can overcome subtype bias by increasing CD4+ T cell help, thereby inducing a robust immune response to all strains included in the formulation. The antibody response against multiple strains was higher with the coupled antigen formulation in comparison to the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine in a human organoid system, and a mouse model.

Although in cases of minor injury, peripheral nerves can regenerate, for more severe injuries, direct microsurgical nerve repair is the preferred treatment. surgery often improves neurologic function in cases of severe peripheral nerve injury, but complete recovery of function is unfortunately quite rare. Surgical repair may fail to restore normal function as seen in approximately 40-60% of cases. There are currently no pharmacologic treatments available to patients that can accelerate nerve regeneration after injury and observation, direct surgical repair, or nerve graft repair. Given the high failure rate of complex nerve reconstruction, more effective methods of reconstruction are necessary.\nStanford researchers have found that a low dose of a small-molecule, systemic pathway agonist, SAG21k, improves nerve regeneration after injury and increases expression of injury-responsive genes within Schwann cells in the injured nerve. SAG21k is a potent hedgehog signaling pathway agonist that targets Smoothened, the key pathway effector protein. Administration is also feasible during surgery and may reduce the risk of systemic side effects.\nStage of Development\nIn vivo mouse models: researchers have found that the Smo agonist SAG21k improves nerve regeneration after injury in a mouse model.

Their rapid laser liftoff wafer recovery technique may reduce cost and fabrication time by an order of magnitude. Currently, gallium arsenide (GaAs) single crystal growth substrates – used for the best performing solar cells – are expensive and difficult to grow (accounting for an estimated 1/3 of the cost of GaAs solar cells). Because the GaAs solar cells do not depend on the substrate for operation, it is desirable that the solar cell thin films be removed from the GaAs wafer and the wafer reused for multiple growths. The Stanford process, by effectively multiplying the number of cells that may be recovered per wafer reuse, can significantly increase throughput and reduce costs. Moreover, the process is not limited to solar cells and may be used to produce many III-V thin film devices.\nStage of Development\nThe researchers report that their process achieves the same effect as multiplying the number of possible wafer recovery cycles by x, where x is the number of devices grown per growth process.

This invention can non-invasively concentrate ultrasound waves onto peripheral nerves without impacting surrounding tissue. It uses focused ultrasound waves to block pain fibers for 1-2 weeks with minimal motor fiber blockage, avoiding problems with common pharmaceutical painkillers and traditional 'nerve block' techniques.\nPain after surgery or injury is often moderate-to-severe for 1-2 weeks and the majority of patients have poorly controlled acute pain during this time. Moderate-to-severe acute pain is associated with increased risk of a wide array of worsened health outcomes including developing myocardial ischemia, impaired pulmonary function, ileus, thromboembolism, impaired immune function, infection, and anxiety. Opioids are commonly prescribed to treat pain and they do well at controlling dull, burning, or rest pain, but don't do as well at controlling sharp or movement pain. Traditional 'nerve blocks' use inject local anesthetics near nerves; these local anesthetic drugs block all nerve fibers, not just pain fibers, including motor and non-pain sensory fibers, which can increase the risk of a patient falling and prevents early participation in physical therapy. There is therefore a significant need for a non-invasive, non-drug based pain therapy which can block acute pain for 1-2 weeks after surgery or injury without the risk of major side effects.

Thus, global efforts are directed to develop replacement islets from renewable sources like human stem cell lines. Despite progress in this area, stem cell-derived replacement islets (SCRIs) lack functional maturation, and recent work has identified molecular, signaling and genetic features of this incomplete development. This includes evidence for GPCR-based signaling between islet cells during fetal development, and expression of crucial factors like the transcriptional regulators in normal human islet beta cell maturation. Islet development in humans and other vertebrates involves aggregation of individual islet cells into multicellular islets to produce heterogeneous clusters of beta, alpha, and delta cells, and other non-islet cell types. Thus, from their birth, interactions between islet cells likely guide islet development. However, the mechanisms of intra-islet signaling to foster human islet development and maturation remain poorly characterized.\nTo address this knowledge gap, inventors at Stanford have exploited the use of pseudoislets to mix SCRI cells and native human islet cells to create mixed chimeras. By using molecular and electrophysiological assays, they showed that exposure of SCRI beta cells to native islet cells in such in vitro cell mixtures substantially enhances their molecular and functional maturation. The invention disperses cells from stem-cell-derived protocols, and mixes these with dispersed bona fide islet cells from adult donors (human or pig). They are then cultured briefly before being re-isolated into the stem cell-derived progeny resembling islet beta-cells. When re-isolated, these show improved features including production of maturity markers and improved function. These pseudoislets have been demonstrated to function and be transplantable in diabetic animals. The invention identifies a process to provide crucial signals for islet maturation and can be applied for development of replacement islet beta cells or other islet cell types.\n\nApplications: Stem cell-derived replacement islets for diabetes, Renewable human beta cells.\n\nAdvantages: Retains key features of native human beta cells, including SIX2 and SIX3 production that stimulate beta function and specialization, Improved features including production of maturity markers and improved function, Biocompatible and transplantable in vivo.","**Summary:** The technology focuses on developing a method to create chimeric pseudoislets by combining stem cell-derived replacement islet (SCRI) cells with native human islet cells. This approach aims to improve the functional maturation of SCRIs, which have been found to lack certain key features and signaling necessary for optimal performance. Research indicates that the aggregation and interaction of different types of islet cells play a critical role in islet development, thus, the use of mixed chimeras could facilitate better intra-islet signaling and maturation by leveraging the biological characteristics of native islet cells.

**Applications:** This method could be applicable in transplantation therapies for type 1 and type 3c diabetes mellitus (T1D and T3cD), providing an improved source of functional islets for patients in need of islet replacement. Additionally, it may contribute to the development of personalized treatments by utilizing a patient's own stem cells in combination with native islet cells.

**Problem Solved:** The method addresses the significant issue of the scarcity of human cadaveric pancreas donors for islet transplantation by developing a renewable source of islet-like clusters that can better mimic the functional and structural properties of native islets, potentially leading to improved outcomes in diabetes treatment.","Mature pancreatic islets are crucial for transplantation in type 1 and type 3c diabetes mellitus, but their availability is limited due to a shortage of human donors.

CZB-230S\nStanford ref. no. S21-394\nResearchers at Stanford have developed new lentiviral vectors that are able to deliver more genetic information than currently available vectors, aiding in the development of gene therapy.\nGene therapy is one of the most promising therapeutic avenues in translational medicine. This method involves the genetic engineering of cells in living humans to replace dysfunctional or pathogenic versions of genes. Several methods have been proposed for delivering gene therapy in patients, one of which is lentiviral vectors (LVVs). Lentiviruses are a group of retroviruses that can insert parts of their genetic material into a host cell's genome, including non-dividing cells. While LVVs have many advantages for use in gene therapy, one caveat of this approach is the limited capacity of these vectors. LVVs have approximately an 8-12 kilobase (kb) payload, which limits their delivery capacity to 1-2 genes. This physical limitation attenuates LVVs effectiveness in clinical gene therapy settings in which a larger payload capacity is needed to resolve genetic mutations.\nStage of Development\nResearch -\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have devised a strategy to produce LVVs with roughly double the payload capacity of those currently available. Wild-type LVVs have two identical or nearly identical gRNAs. However, the full capacity of these gRNAs was not able to be utilized due to dimerization interactions between the two gRNAs that result in dimer linkage structure that is integral to viral packaging. The inventors have designed LVV structures that allow for the combining of the two gRNAs such that interactions between like-gRNAs that would form homodimers are thermodynamically favored and stabilized, while interactions between unlike gRNAs that would form heterodimers are not thermodynamically favored and stabilized. Thus, these LVVs can form dimer linkage structures needed for viral packaging (homodimers) while avoiding heterodimers that would disrupt distinct sequences meant to be delivered as a payload into the genomes of human cells.\n\nApplications: Use of increased-capacity LVVs for gene therapy in vivo, Use of increased-capacity LVVs as research tools.\n\nAdvantages: Roughly double the payload capacity of LVVs used under current methods, Increased payload capacity makes these LVVs for broad use in a myriad of biomedical applications that require more than 1-2 genes to be modified..","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford have developed novel lentiviral vectors that significantly increase the amount of genetic information that can be delivered, enhancing the potential for gene therapy applications. Traditional lentiviral vectors are constrained by a payload capacity of approximately 8-12 kilobases, which limits their ability to deliver multiple genes effectively. The new vectors are designed to nearly double this capacity, allowing for a more robust delivery of genetic material.

(A?) is a key protein involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A key property of A? that is now believed to be at the core of its toxicity in AD is its ability to form soluble, toxic oligomers. Targeting such oligomers remains a promising avenue for AD therapeutic development. It has been found that 1:1 equimolar LL-37/A?40 mixtures are totally prevented from forming A? fibrils, while lower relative molar amounts of LL-37 slow the kinetics of fibril formation; and in this patent, a synthetic peptoid mimic of LL-37 is also shown to bind A?.\nIt has also become clear that sporadic AD (not resulting from a unique familial predisposition to disease) is either caused by or accompanied by the occurrence of polymicrobial brain infections and dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Certain oral pathogens that are associated with dementia—including Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG), Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) and Candida albicans—can be killed or inactivated by the LL-37 peptide, which is produced by the human innate immune system, as well as by peptoid mimics of LL-37 described in this patent.\nAlthough A?:LL-37 interactions offer an interesting starting point in the development of new therapeutic approaches that block A? aggregation and toxicity, the relatively complex, poorly understood, pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects of LL-37, as well as its relatively high molecular weight (~4500 g/mol, 37 amino acids) and extreme vulnerability to cleavage by proteases, are substantially disadvantageous features from the standpoint of using the peptide as an exogenous AD therapeutic. Thus, a biostable peptoid mimic of LL-37 is more promising.\nTechnology\nIt was recently discovered that certain peptoid mimics of LL-37 share the same anti-amyloid activity of the peptide, while also exhibiting potent antimicrobial and antiviral activity against both P. gingivalis, HSV-1, and C. albicans. Thus, these peptoids have the potential to be developed as antimicrobial treatments that may also serve as anti-amyloid treatments.\nFigure:\n\nApplications: Therapeutic or prophylactic treatments for Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nAdvantages: Leverages recently discovered aspects of A? amyloid formation, A?:LL-37 interactions and A?:peptoid interactions, Simultaneously reduces A? amyloid loads and addresses the polymicrobial brain infections that frequently accompany AD.","**Summary:** The technology focuses on a synthetic peptoid that mimics LL-37, which binds to amyloid beta (A?) and has the potential to prevent the toxic aggregation associated with Alzheimer's Disease. The peptoid also demonstrates broad-spectrum antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activity, effectively targeting pathogens linked to dementia, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Herpes Simplex Virus-1, and Candida albicans. This approach highlights the connection between polymicrobial brain infections and Alzheimer's, suggesting that interventions targeting these infections could influence disease progression.

**Applications:** The peptoid can be applied in the development of therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's Disease, particularly in blocking A? aggregation and addressing polymicrobial infections in the brain.

CZB-204S-PC\nStanford ref. no. S21-067\nResearchers at Stanford have developed an innovation that will enhance the depth of the imaging capabilities for optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging.\nOptical coherence tomography is a technique for visualizing various medias that was originally developed in the 1990s for the imaging of ocular measurements. This technique is of clinical significance due to its ability to image tissue morphology at a much higher resolution than other clinical imaging techniques such as MRI. OCT provides what are effectively 'optical ultrasound' images by directing an optical beam at a tissue of interest. A fraction of this light will then be reflected from sub-surface features of the tissue and subsequently recorded to create a digital reconstruction of the sub-surface tissue morphology. The key advantage of this technique is its high resolution and lack of ionizing radiation due to its use of light as a reflective source rather than sound or radio frequency. Despite advancements in the field of OCT imaging, improved methods to extend the depth of focus in these systems represents a major unmet medical need.\nStage of Development\nResearch-\nin vivo\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed new methods of creating needle-shaped beams to extend the depth of focus in OCT imaging systems. Briefly, a diffractive optical element with a predetermined phase profile is used to create a single beam with multiple foci along the axial direction of propagation.

CZB-273S-P1\nStanford ref. no. S22-487\nResearchers at Stanford University have developed a new approach for proximity labeling via optogenetic control.\nAllosteric regulation is common in naturally occurring enzymes in living tissues. However, despite its ability to improve spatial and temporal control, allostery has yet to be used extensively in artificially engineered enzymes.\nOne artificially engineered enzyme, TurboID, achieves broad proximity-dependent biotinylation. While Turbo is useful for mapping interactomes and organelle proteomes both in vivo and in vitro, one important drawback is that Turbo's substrate, biotin, is endogenously expressed in most tissues of living organisms. This endogenous expression severely limits its temporal specificity. Furthermore, poor genetic integration and targeting can additionally contribute to the limited spatial specificity of Turbo and other proximity labeling enzymes. This limitation can be highly dependent on cell type, cellular compartment, and proteins of interest. Further methods are needed to improve the spatial specificity of proximity labeling via Turbo.\nStage of Development\nResearch -\nin vivo\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a light-regulated version of Turbo, dubbed LOV-Turbo. This enzyme was engineered through a combination of structure-guided design, screening and directed evolution to express a light-dependent domain. LOV-Turbo has virtually undetectable activity in darkness but activates within seconds of weak blue light illumination. Additionally, LOV-Turbo has an extremely wide dynamic range even in the presence of high amounts of biotin. The inventors have proven in a peer-reviewed study that this enzyme can efficiently and accurately perform proximity labeling in yeast, bacteria, and the mouse brain.

"Stanford University","Methods and proteins for targeting human progenitor exhausted T cells","Docket #: S23-114","Published Application: WO2024206930","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/methods-and-proteins-targeting-human-progenitor-exhausted-t-cells","Immune checkpoint blockade, a class of immunotherapy treatment which works by blocking inhibitory receptors on T cells to improve immune responses, has proven to be a remarkable clinical advance in the treatment of many diseases, particularly in cancer. However, most patients do not benefit from checkpoint blockade, and many of those who do eventually experience progression of disease. While the use of immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized cancer treatment, there is a need for greater mechanistic understanding of how checkpoint blockade works in patients.\nRecent studies have suggested that the success of immune checkpoint blockade may be related to the expansion of a population of T cells known as progenitor exhausted T cells. This population of progenitor exhausted T cells is known to express the inhibitory receptor PD-1 and the transcription factor TCF1. However, TCF1 is not expressed on the cell surface, making it difficult to target. Furthermore, there is no validated way to target these progenitor exhausted T cells in humans, as most studies have been performed in mice. Thus, there is an unmet need for more markers that can specifically identify progenitor exhausted T cells in humans. Doing so could enable the selective targeting and activation of the exhausted T cell population, potentially leading to improved patient responses to immune checkpoint blockade.\nInventors at Stanford have profiled the T cell compartment of patients with lung cancer using single-cell-paired RNA and T cell receptor sequencing methods at high depth and regional resolution. They have identified a population of progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells in the lymph node of patients that are clonally linked to terminally exhausted T cells in the tumor. Additionally, by performing antigen specificity assays, the inventors found that this progenitor exhausted T cell population comprises a subset of tumor antigen-specific T cells, suggesting they are involved in the tumor response. Computational analysis identified several genes that preferentially mark these lymph node progenitor exhausted T cells, including CCL5, CMC1, EOMES, IL32, SIRPG, RARRES3, CST7, GZMM, and PDIA3. This invention can enable methods that can specifically target progenitor exhausted T cells in humans to modulate this population for clinical benefit.\n\nApplications: Immunology research, Selective targeting and activation of progenitor T cell population during immune checkpoint blockade treatment, Immunotherapy.\n\nAdvantages: There is currently no clinical standard for targeting these progenitor exhausted T cells in humans..","**Summary:** The description outlines advancements in immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade, which enhances T cell responses to treat diseases like cancer. Despite its success, many patients do not respond sufficiently to this treatment, prompting the need for deeper insights into its mechanisms. Recent findings indicate that progenitor exhausted T cells, which express the inhibitory receptor PD-1 and the transcription factor TCF1, might play a crucial role in the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade. However, targeting these cells poses challenges since TCF1 is not expressed on the cell surface, and no validated techniques exist to identify or target these T cells in humans. 

**Applications:** The ability to identify and target progenitor exhausted T cells in human patients could enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapies, leading to better patient outcomes in the treatment of cancers and possibly other diseases that rely on T cell activation.

**Problem Solved:** The technology addresses the lack of specific markers to identify progenitor exhausted T cells in humans, which has hindered efforts to effectively target and activate these cells, ultimately aiming to improve responses to existing immunotherapies.","Immune checkpoint blockade is an immunotherapy that enhances T cell responses by blocking inhibitory receptors, significantly advancing cancer treatment. Despite its success, a majority of patients do not benefit from this approach, and many experience disease progression even after initial response."

Despite success in the development of synthetic receptors, most are not compatible with currently available therapeutic application systems, or the systems are difficult to use and their requirements impede many in vivo applications. The LIDAR system consists of three core components: an mRNA and two fusion proteins that dimerize upon the presence of a ligand. The first fusion protein enables strong and specific binding to the mRNA. The other fusion protein contains a catalytic domain that is placed in close proximity to the mRNA, enabling editing of the mRNA and allowing translation of an output (protein) coding sequence on the mRNA.\nThere are three classes of LIDAR sensors with the same core mechanism of activation: cLIDAR with a cytosolic ligand, eLIDAR with an extracellular ligand but intracellular components, and tLIDAR with an extracellular ligand whose detection is mediated by a natural receptor, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). LIDAR can detect most extracellular ligands that have a natural receptor including small molecules, peptides, and proteins. The input could also be synthetic, allowing for detection of most proteins that can be bound by antibodies, natural binding domains, or small molecules that can trigger dimerization of a protein pair. LIDAR is also capable of sensing intangible external stimuli, such as light or magnet fields. Multiple inputs could also be detected at the same time with multiple distinct outputs or conditional outputs. LIDAR can further directly interface with RADAR technology to detect both an mRNA of interest and a protein of interest. The output could be any protein that is able to be encoded on a single mRNA transcript.\nStage of Development:\nProof of Concept\n\nApplications: Can be integrated into natural signaling cascades or synthetic circuits for precise tuning of complex cellular functions, Can enable detection of both cell type (as defined by mRNAs in the cell) and the surrounding state (as defined by proteins, peptides, or small molecules inside or outside the cell), Could be applied as the basis of next-generation cell therapies such as CAR-T, Could be applied in cell engineering applications, allowing for markerless selection of cells for purification or to screen for increased protein production.\n\nAdvantages: Leverages RNA editing to exert function, a feature that no existing synthetic receptors possess, Can incorporate signals from an expanded set of inputs not accessible with current technologies, Can be delivered wholly by RNA, which broadens potential delivery strategies and enables in vivo delivery, Response time would be much faster than synthetic receptors that rely on transcription factors, Can be built upon completely humanized components, which is much safer and more compatible with in vivo applications, Can be built upon a variety of receptor architectures (cLIDAR, eLIDAR and tLIDAR).","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford have developed a versatile molecular sensor called LIDAR that translates the presence of a ligand into the production of an output protein. The system comprises an mRNA molecule and two fusion proteins that dimerize in response to ligand presence. One fusion protein binds specifically to the mRNA, while the other contains a catalytic domain that facilitates RNA editing and subsequent protein translation. There are three types of LIDAR sensors: cLIDAR, which responds to cytosolic ligands; eLIDAR, which reacts to extracellular ligands but operates with intracellular components; and tLIDAR, which detects extracellular ligands through natural receptors like GPCRs or RTKs.

**Applications:** LIDAR can potentially be applied in various therapeutic areas by enabling precise control of protein synthesis in response to a wide range of extracellular ligands, including small molecules, peptides, and proteins. Its versatility allows for the detection of both natural and synthetic ligands, making it useful for applications in drug development, gene therapy, and synthetic biology.

**Problem Solved:** The technology addresses the limitations of existing synthetic receptors that are often incompatible with therapeutic applications or are overly complex for in vivo use. By providing a straightforward mechanism for ligand detection and protein translation, LIDAR enhances the usability of synthetic sensors in biological contexts, thereby expanding the opportunities for targeted therapeutic interventions.","Researchers at Stanford have developed a molecular sensor called ligand-induced dimerization activating RNA editing (LIDAR) that converts ligand presence into protein translation.

Although it is known that epicardial cells on the surface of the heart give rise to coronary artery smooth muscle deep in the myocardium, the differentiation steps between the epicardium and mature smooth muscle were previously unknown. Inventors at Stanford discovered that pericytes, mural cells closely associated with small blood vessels, are epicardial-derived progenitors for coronary artery smooth muscle. Pericytes is a new potential cell type for cell therapy that could be used for vascular regeneration, revascularization after an infarct, or vascular malformation.\nThe Red-Horse Lab have developed a method of providing smooth muscle cells to a tissue where they are needed. The invention involves creating an isolated population of epicardial-derived pericytes and providing the pericytes to the tissue of interest.

Lower muscle mass across large human cohorts has been strongly associated with higher incidence of obesity, worsened diabetes and metabolic disease, frailty in the elderly, and even increased mortality. A class of peptide ligands that regulate muscle mass are growth hormone (GH) secretagogues. These peptide agonists act in the pituitary to increase GH secretion, leading to downstream activation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) and IGF1-mediated anabolic pathways. GH secretagogues have attracted considerable therapeutic potential as anti-frailty and anti-cachexic agents, while also being explored for growth retardation, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and cardiometabolic disease.\nInventors at Stanford have devised a genomic prediction algorithm to identify candidate pyroglutamyl amidated peptides that might be hidden within existing genomic sequences. By applying this algorithm to the mouse and human genomes, they have identified candidate peptides sequences with both N- and C-terminal posttranslational modifications that are 100% conserved between the two species. A subset of the synthetic peptides corresponding to these predicted sequences exhibit robust GH secretagogue activity in vitro. The inventors showed robust detection of these peptides in mouse plasma, establishing their endogenous presence. Furthermore, they have obtained evidence for a receptor-based mechanism of action that is independent of the classical GHS receptor and GHRH receptor pathways. The identified peptides might be useful for the treatment of disorders, including cachexia, growth retardation, frailty, and gastrointestinal dysfunction, via the anabolic activation of the GH/IGF1.\n\nApplications: -A drug for patients for increasing muscle mass and preventing frailty, cachexia, or growth retardation., -Cellular and molecular research techniques, -Cell signaling, -Algorithm to identify peptides for metabolic pathways.\n\nAdvantages: -Computational platform enables identification of peptides that activate the GH/IGF1 axis independent of any of the known upstream pathways, -Predicted sequences are validated in vitro, -can be used to detect peptides from unknown pathways.","**Summary:** This technology highlights the discovery of novel secreted peptides with potential signaling activities that may play a role in regulating muscle mass. The reduction of muscle mass is linked to various metabolic issues and increased mortality, prompting research into peptide ligands known as growth hormone secretagogues, which enhance GH secretion and activate anabolic pathways via IGF1. The inventors at Stanford developed a genomic prediction algorithm to uncover candidate peptides with specific posttranslational modifications, finding sequences conserved across mouse and human genomes. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that some of these peptides exhibit significant GH secretagogue activity and are detectable in mouse plasma, suggesting their natural presence and potential biological significance.

There are currently extended release steroid implants for the posterior segment of the eye. Recently, there was a novel drug delivery device for extended anti-VEGF medication, which involved a refillable intraocular reservoir with a diffusion filter to allow for extended release. However, due to the nature of the surgery during implantation, there are side effects including a 2% endophthalmitis rate, 5.2% vitreous hemorrhage, 3.6% conjunctival erosion, and 5.9% conjunctival bleb. This limits clinical adoptability. The lens capsule is a safe space in the eye and has an extensive safety profile for implanted intraocular lenses. Stanford researchers propose using a drug delivery scaffold for implantation in the lens capsule at the time of cataract surgery, which is known as a safe surgery with very low surgical complications. This drug delivery scaffold is used to hold the new intraocular lens at the time of cataract surgery. In addition, it contains a valved drug delivery reservoir with a diffusion filter to allow extended drug delivery. The lens capsule is between the anterior and posterior segments of the eye and will allow for extended drug delivery to the anterior chamber for anterior medications such as glaucoma medication, antibiotics, and steroids. It will also allow extended drug delivery to the posterior chamber with medications targeting the retina, such as anti-VEGF medications, complement inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and chemotherapy medications.

Miniaturization of these optical components is key to facilitating their integration into a range of applications. Despite many advances, the size and weight of traditional macroscopic lenses and dynamic optical elements still take up significant space due to their use of classic optical elements. Therefore, it is highly desirable to reduce the size and weight of the dynamic optical components in such systems. Subwavelength control over the phase using ordered arrays of nanoantennae, or metasurfaces, could allow this goal to be achieved. Tunable metasurface lenses have been realized and typically use strain or thermal tuning of the entire metasurface or mechanical movement between metasurface lenses. Recent efforts have demonstrated impressive modulation of phase and color of pixel elements that could be individually actuated with high-speed microelectromechanical MEMs technology. However, these are challenging to fabricate and experience limitations in dynamic applications due to vibration instability.\nInventors at Stanford have created a hybrid polymer/metal tunable optical metasurface system, with operation in wavelength ranges from the visible to the infrared. It can reversibly tune the color and phase of reflected wavefronts through applications of stimuli, including applied voltage or application of suitable fluids to the surface of the metasurface. The tuning mechanism is non-volatile, involving changes in polymer thickness due to changes in thermodynamic equilibrium condition. . In the case of fluidic control, the fluid infiltrates into the polymer and causes a change in the swelling degree. In the case of electrochemical control, applied voltage leads to ion intercalation, modifying the swelling degree. Depending on the specific design chosen, this can result in a change of the reflected color from the metasurface, continuous tuning of the direction of the reflected beam, or on-off modulation between different diffraction orders. These ultra-thin devices can also be made with thicknesses of 500nm, much smaller than conventional optical elements that range from the millimeter to centimeter scale.

Multiplexing droplet multiplexed systems isuseful for increasing throughput and required for some custom assays, and several strategies have been implemented. These include multiple fluorescence dyes (e.g., using multiple emission wavelengths and color filters), barcoding of droplets using barcoded particles, and barcoding using gel beads containing barcoded synthetic DNA. When samples are labeled by color, a one-to-one relationship between color and a particle or reaction is common, limiting the degree of multiplexing. This is due to the finite bandwidth of the emission spectrum of commonly used fluorophores, and the limited range of the visible spectrum. There is a need for higher multiplexing capabilities for droplet microfluidics systems.\nTherefore, Stanford inventors developed a novel multiplexing method that uses fluorescence and encoding of multiple samples by the spatial and temporal sequence of droplet formations and the subsequent spatial positioning of droplets in a constrained, poorly mixed output region.

It has the potential to revolutionize clinical trials, sleep studies, and even patient monitoring of recovery after injury or surgery. One of the most important applications of actigraphy is to understand natural sleep-wake patterns, especially since these are nearly impossible to truly replicate in a clinical or laboratory setting. With actigraphy, we can quantify the duration, timing, and quality of sleep experienced at home using automated algorithms. Actigraphy traditionally relies on data across multiple days or weeks to characterize routines and activity-rest cycles of a single person. While this may be possible for those who follow strict routines, reliance on longitudinal data collection to establish sleep patterns is not possible for those with erratic sleeping patterns or changing schedules, or in cases of shorter duration studies.\nThe Coleman Lab at Stanford has invented an algorithm capable of classifying sleep and wake states in a single day from triaxial accelerometer data. Traditional actigraphy relies on days to weeks' worth of activity data to characterize patterns of activity and rest within individuals, but reliance on longitudinal data is challenging for short studies and for individuals with irregular schedules. This novel, two-stage algorithm classifies sleep and wake states from a single day. The algorithm uses many features of triaxial accelerometer data to capture the signal variability, and a two-step process modeling reduces the noise from each single-stage classification alone. Additionally, existing algorithms classify sleep from proprietary actigraphy device outputs, but triaxial accelerometers are built into most smart devices and can be used by this algorithm, making tracking activity cycles more accessible. The invention is more accurate (97%) than the gold standard Cole-Kripke algorithm (60-70%) used in commercial clinical devices.

First, it is difficult to assign a causal relationship between biomarkers and MDD because causal tests are rarely performed on seemingly MDD-related differences identified in patients. Second, although MDD arises from aberrant communication in the brain, many neuroimaging studies evaluate either tonic activity levels in individual brain regions or functional connectivity between brain regions. The latter comes with a major caveat that signaling directionality is not assigned, with possibly significant physiological implications.\nStanford researchers sought to address these problems by examining how directed communication patterns in the human brain relate to the neurobiology of MDD using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and rs-fMRI. They found that active rTMS modulates the directional flow of rs-fMRI activity between different brain regions and that variance in the temporal effect's magnitude corresponds to treatment efficacy. Additionally, they found that rTMS corrects a baseline aberrancy in neural flow patterns. They also showed that the baseline temporal structure of individual patients with MDD can predict treatment response. Hence, they developed a novel biomarker for depression treatment efficacy.\nNote: This docket is related to S22-390, which describes neuromodulation targeting based on lag-based resting state functional connectivity.\nStage of Development\nResearch - in vivo\n\nApplications: Biomarker for efficacy of depression treatment.\n\nAdvantages: No other such biomarker exists on the market..","**Summary:** Stanford scientists developed a strategy utilizing resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to assess the likelihood of a person’s response to depression treatment. This approach targets the abnormal communication patterns within brain networks that contribute to major depressive disorder (MDD). Traditional methods have not effectively identified biomarkers due to challenges in establishing causal relationships and the limitations of evaluating brain connectivity without considering directionality. The researchers discovered that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can influence the directional flow of rs-fMRI activity across brain regions, indicating a potential for improved treatment outcomes based on directed communication patterns.

**Applications:** The technology is applicable in the treatment of major depressive disorder by providing a method to predict treatment response using advanced neuroimaging techniques. It can enhance the personalization of depression therapies, allowing for targeted interventions that align with specific brain connectivity profiles.

**Problem Solved:** This approach addresses the longstanding challenge of identifying reliable biomarkers for major depressive disorder, overcoming the obstacles of causal inference and the need for understanding directional communication in brain networks. By integrating rs-fMRI and rTMS, it offers a new pathway for more effective and tailored treatments for individuals suffering from depression.","Stanford scientists have developed a new strategy using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to identify potential treatment responses for major depressive disorder (MDD).

However most hospitals were initially unable to process even 1000 tests per day due to the shortage of reagents and other resources, whereas an order of magnitude or more that number of clinical tests were needed to adequately meet patients' needs. In addition, due to the high positivity rate of tested populations, standard pooling assays (where groups of samples are co-purified and patients in positive groups are re-tested individually) were not appropriate as, by mid-March 2020, up to 25% of tests in highly populated regions such as New York were positive. Therefore, a multiplexed strategy was necessary to allow the scaling up of tests while robustly preserving patient identity.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have designed an approach to non-enzymatically barcode patient samples in large collection volumes and then concentrate those samples within a pooled library. Each barcode consists of three high-melting temperature oligos that anneal at adjacent positions along the viral genome and thereby also provide a position barcode. After annealing barcoding oligos to the target viral RNA, each oligo is then ligated using an RNA-splinted ligation. The ligation product is then amplified and distributed into 2n wells and the abundance of each ligated barcode is then quantified by qPCR with patient-specific primers as a proxy for viral load. Each barcoded patient sample is also redundantly pooled in two non-overlapping patient cohorts along with positive and normalizing controls, providing replicate readouts for each patient's samples.\nStage of Development\nResearch – in vitro\n\nApplications: A unified testing platform for clinical laboratories to dramatically scale up community surveillance and patient diagnostics., Identifying positive patient samples within a pooled population without the need to exhaustively reprocess all patients within positive cohorts..\n\nAdvantages: The assay allows testing with a ligase rather than a reverse-transcriptase enzyme, providing an alternative way to create the template for the qPCR reaction., The assay provides quadruple redundancy to capture measurement noise for both sample barcoding and real-time qPCR., The core workflow with approximately 1000 samples can be completed in ~2.5 hours by a staff of 2-3 people, thereby the inventors' conservative estimate of throughput for this method is 10,000 samples per day for each available 384-well plate qPCR machine., All aspects of the IPSM technology can be implemented using standard equipment and commonly available molecular biology reagents..","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford have developed a method called Identity Preserving Sample Multiplexing (IPSM) for the rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals.

Despite recent advances in therapies targeting plaques (monoclonal antibody therapies), there is currently no treatment currently available that can stop, prevent, or reverse the pathogenesis of AD. Additionally, AD pathology often begins decades before the onset of measurable clinical symptoms or neurologic deficits. In another vein, evidence in the literature suggests that adult neurogenesis is impaired in AD, specifically in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the hippocampus, which may contribute to the neuropathogenesis of this disease. Neural stem/precursor cells (NPC) in this region have been reported to be abrogated in animal models of dementia, but it remains an open question whether this finding is a side effect or a causative factor in AD disease processes.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have defined a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of AD through targeting important molecular pathways in adult NPCs. Through their research, the inventors have discovered that cell-intrinsic NPC deficits are at least partially regulated by Cdkn2a, which has been implicated in tumor formation. To avoid off-target effects, the inventors modulated bone morphogenic protein receptors (BMPRs) which are highly expressed in adult NPCs. By inhibiting BMPR signaling, the inventors determined that BMPR inhibition rescues plaque formation via mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP). Prevention of the formation of mutant APP in turn prevents self-mediated renewal defects in human neurospheres.

S20-303\nResearchers at Stanford have developed a method for real-time wireless resistive sensing using non-linear PT-symmetry.\nFully passive sensors are lower cost and less complex than their active sensor counterparts. Indeed, fully passive sensors consist of two primary components: an inductor and a sensing element. Sensing elements are either a capacitor or a resistor whose value fluctuates in response to a measurable parameter. This measurable parameter is read in fully passive sensors by magnetically coupling a primary or reader coil to the sensor coil. Sensor measurement is performed by detecting fluctuations in the impedance profile (the effective resistance of an electric circuit or component to alternating current) of the reader coil that corresponds to variations in the sensor. Measuring these fluctuations proves difficult due to the necessity of sizeable lab equipment and the fact that measurements are prone to errors when performed at different distances and orientations. However, when a resonant reader (inductive-capacitive) is tuned to the same resonant frequency as the sensor, it improves the sensitivity of the sensor to fluctuations. This results in impedance fluctuations with sharper features, allowing for more accurate measurements.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors establish a sensing method that enables robust measurement in a real-time, distance immune fashion. This system uses fully passive resistive sensors for coupling independent, powerful wireless sensing. This invention removes the need for sweeping, which allows the system to convey real-time, single point sensing. Self-oscillation remarkably simplifies the reader and is achieved through a fast-settling nonlinearity. This fast-settling nonlinearity has a voltage amplitude that is proportional to the sensor's resistance. Additionally, system analysis is generalized to arbitrary operating conditions through a dual time-scale theoretical framework. Finally, detuning from PT-symmetric conditions by an order of magnitude allows for a robust correction strategy that reduces errors in the system.

CZB-171S\nResearchers at Stanford University have developed a novel treatment for coronavirus infection.\nCoronavirus infections are endemic in humans and were the causative pathogen in up to 30% of seasonal upper respiratory infections prior to 2020. Several coronaviruses of interest including MERS, SARS-CoV1, and SARS-CoV2 have emerged in recent years. These novel viruses proved to be infectious to humans and arose ostensibly through zoonotic jumps from both reservoir species (bats) and amplifier species (raccoon dogs, pangolins). Of these novel coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV2 has proved to be especially worrisome, resulting in a world-wide pandemic and 6.8 million deaths as of March 2023. While mRNA vaccines have curtailed infection and mortality rates, few therapeutic drugs exist for those who do become infected. SARS-CoV2 enters cells by binding its Spike protein to the ACE2 receptor which is expressed in a myriad of tissues, including the lungs and epithelial cells that line blood vessels. SARS-CoV2's entrance into cells via the ACE2 receptor is necessary for the virus to be able replicate and cause downstream pathogenic effects.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have identified inhibitors of transmembrane serine protease family member II (TMPRSS2), a known mediator of cell entry of pathogenic coronaviruses. TMPRSS2 is co-expressed in the lung with ACE2, the SARS-CoV2 entry receptor.

"Stanford University","Myc degradation by long non coding RNA for cancer therapeutics","Docket #: S22-163","Published Application: WO2023212572","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/myc-degradation-long-non-coding-rna-cancer-therapeutics","Researchers at Stanford University have discovered that the absence of a long non coding RNA (lnc122) predisposed mice to high numbers of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), and its replacement decreased the risk of HCC. Mechanistic studies revealed that lnc122 acts via degradation of the oncogenic protein Myc. Consequently, methods to increase lnc122 expression can be used to treat a variety of Myc driven and/or dependent cancers.\nDysregulation of the MYC proto-oncogene occurs in ~70% of all human cancers and is linked to poor prognosis. Accordingly, the Myc protein is a transcription factor that is a major driver of tumorigenesis and a well-established cancer target for a variety of cancers, including liver cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, among others. However, inhibition of Myc has proven difficult due to its lack of a traditionally druggable binding pocket and primarily nuclear localization. Alternative methods for targeting Myc are being pursued, such as targeting MYC transcription or mRNA translation, preventing its function as a transcription factor by blocking binding of Myc to chromatin or Max, and promoting Myc degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS). While these strategies are promising and numerous clinical studies are being pursued, there have yet to be approved cancer drugs targeting Myc.\nThis technology offers a contrasting strategy to promote Myc degradation via the UPS. Current approaches to hijack the UPS include proteolysis-targeting chimaeras (PROTACs), which bring the target protein and E3 protein ligase into close proximity with a heterobifunctional molecule. This strategy is difficult in the case of Myc as high affinity ligands for the target protein are required. In contrast, here, the inventors found that a long non coding RNA present in hepatocytes, lnc122, serves as a mediator for E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UBR5-dependent Myc degradation. Specifically, lnc122 enhances the binding of UBR5 to Myc, resulting in ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Myc. While lnc122 is naturally present primarily in liver cells, UBR5-dependent ubiquitination occurs across tissues. Thus, strategies which increase the expression and/or presence of lnc122 can be applied to promote Myc degradation in a variety of tumor types.\nFigure 1. Schematic of lnc122-mediated targeted protein degradation of Myc. (Credit to the inventors)\nStage of Development: In vivo data\n\nApplications: Therapeutics for Myc driven/dependent cancers.\n\nAdvantages: By targeting a driver oncogene/protein such as Myc, therapies can be developed for cancers that currently have no targeted therapies, Tumors are highly dependent on driver oncogenes, making targeting these drivers such as MYC highly promising for significant clinical benefit, Myc is a promising cancer target, but is difficult to target with traditional approaches, such as small molecules and antibodies, Lnc122 enables targeted degradation of Myc via the UPS system and can be applied to a variety of tumor types.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford University have found that the absence of the long non-coding RNA lnc122 increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in mice, while its reintroduction reduces this risk. The mechanism underlying this effect involves lnc122 facilitating the degradation of the oncogenic protein Myc, which is implicated in around 70% of human cancers and is associated with poor patient outcomes. This discovery prompts the exploration of methods to enhance lnc122 expression as a therapeutic approach for various cancers driven or dependent on Myc.

**Applications:** The technology can be applied to the treatment of Myc-driven and/or dependent cancers, including but not limited to liver cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. It provides a novel strategy to promote Myc degradation, thereby possibly overcoming challenges faced in directly inhibiting Myc due to its properties.

**Problem Solved:** This approach addresses the significant challenge of targeting the Myc protein, which has a poorly druggable binding pocket and is primarily localized in the nucleus, making traditional inhibitory techniques ineffective. By promoting Myc degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome system, this technology aims to offer an alternative pathway for effective cancer therapeutics.","Researchers at Stanford University found that the absence of the long non-coding RNA (lnc122) led to an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) in mice, while its replacement reduced this risk. lnc122 functions by degrading the oncogenic protein Myc, suggesting that enhancing lnc122 expression could be a potential therapeutic strategy for Myc-driven cancers."

However, follow-up studies manipulating microglia in vivo to validate functions inferred from RNA-sequencing data are needed. Current tools for microglial manipulation include various genetically modified mouse models, all of which are time-intensive and are infeasible for screening multiple candidate genes from transcriptomic datasets if one is financially- and space-constrained.

While early cancer detection methods such as genetic biomarker screening and regular mammograms have significantly reduced breast cancer mortality in resource-rich settings, treatment options have lagged. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) refers to breast cancer that is estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 negative and is known to have significantly worse treatment outcomes than other breast cancer subtypes, reducing median survival time by 13 months. This decreased survival time is in part due to available treatment strategies as TNBC is unable to be treated with target-specific therapies. Subsequently, the only treatment available to TNBC patients are non-specific treatments such as chemotherapy, which is often less effective, highly cytotoxic, and results in long-term sequelae. Cyclin-dependent kinases, specifically CDK19 and its related isoform CDK8, form complexes with other proteins to regulate RNA polymerase association and transcriptional activity. Compounds that inhibit both CDK19 and CDK8 have been of interest in recent years as anti-cancer therapies, including in TNBC. However, these targets have been abandoned due to off-target effects of CDK8 inhibition, likely caused by its wider tissue distribution as compared to CDK19. A compound that selectively inhibits CDK19 while limiting off-target inhibition of CDK8 has not yet been described in the literature. Given the current lack of treatment options, there is an urgent unmet need to investigate potential therapeutic targets for TNBC.\nStage of Development\nResearch-\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors isolated and characterized a number of compounds that selectively inhibit CDK19 over CDK8. These compounds were assayed using FRET displacement to determine CDK19 selectivity indexes (CDK19 IC50 / CD8K IC50). It was determined that many of the isolated compounds had high CDK19 selectivity, with compound A4 performing exceptionally well with a selectivity index of greater than 50. Furthermore, treatment with CDK19-selective inhibitors in an in vitro TNBC cell line resulted in significant cell death, indicating its efficacy in killing TNBC cancer cells. When CDK19-selective inhibitors were incubated with a human fibroblast cell line in vitro, they did not exhibit significant cell death as compared to controls, suggesting that CDK19-selective inhibitors are not broadly cytotoxic. Indeed, when patient-derived TNBC organoids were treated with compound A4 and subsequently allowed to regrow without pharmacological intervention, TNBC cancer cells failed to regrow when compared to organoids treated with a non-selective CDK19/CDK8 inhibitor and DMSO negative controls. Taken together, these studies suggest that CDK19 selective inhibitors described by the inventors are promising therapeutic candidates for TNBC, with compound A4 being especially promising.\nTechnology Reference\nStanford ref. no.

CZB-162S\n\nApplications: Targeted, non-cytotoxic therapeutic for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).\n\nAdvantages: In vitro studies suggest that these compounds are not broadly cytotoxic, These compounds are a targeted therapy, which lends to them being a more effective treatment option than non-specific TNBC therapies such as chemotherapy, The compounds described by the inventors selectively inhibit CDK19 over CDK8, leading to fewer off-target effects.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford University have discovered selective inhibitors for CDK19, aimed specifically at treating triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a subtype of breast cancer characterized by the absence of estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors.

**Applications:** The CDK19-selective inhibitors are intended for use in treating patients with triple-negative breast cancer, potentially offering a more targeted approach that may enhance efficacy and reduce toxicity compared to current chemotherapy options.

This discrimination hinges on the ability of T-cell receptors (TCR) to recognize specific peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules expressed on antigen presenting cells, which triggers downstream signaling events and T-cell effector functions. However, the relationship between TCR binding and triggering is not fully understood. For instance, measured in vitro affinities with a presented peptide do not always correlate with stimulation of T-cell activity, as some of the most potent stimulatory peptides bind with only weak or moderate affinities. Recent evidence suggests that the pN to nN biomechanical forces generated at the TCR-pMHC interface during T-cell immunosurveillance and synapse formation may be critical for sensitive and specific recognition. Distinguishing agonist peptides from non-agonist peptides therefore requires an in vitro assay in the presence of applied loads that quantifies binding and downstream activation. Currently available screening approaches can only quantify peptide binding alone, and not T-cell activation, and they take place in the absence of force and present peptides at artificially high concentrations, thereby reducing their physiological relevance. Several mechanobiology methods exist that can exert well-calibrated shear loads on T-cells interacting with specific pMHCs displayed at low densities, however these techniques typically require expensive equipment, are labor intensive, and are limited in peptide throughput. A peptide screening method that could probe both TCR binding and triggering at a high throughput level is needed.\nStage of Development\nResearch –\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a novel technology called BATTLES for Biomechanically-Assisted T-cell Triggering for Large-scale Exogenous-pMHC Screening.

Mechanisms contributing to this response are not well understood. Antibodies formed early during infection can bind virus particles, forming immune complexes that neutralize or mediate clearance of virus. However, immune complexes can also promote inflammation and exacerbate symptoms of disease via interactions between antibody Fc domains and Fc gamma receptors, particularly on myeloid cells, which are central regulators of the inflammatory response. How antibodies within immune complexes modulate infection depends, in part, on their Fc domain structure. IgG is the dominant antibody isotype in systemic antiviral immunity. The inventors and others have found that a high abundance of afucosylated IgG antibodies is linked to severe COVID-19, however whether afucosylated IgG production is a consequence of, or an antecedent to, the development of more severe COVID-19 remained unclear.\nStage of Development\nResearch –\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nTwo independent cohorts were assessed during an initial period of mild COVID-19 and it was found that the absence of neutralizing antibodies and an increased abundance of afucosylated IgG was associated with a rapid progression to more severe disease.

However, a growing number of studies indicate that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are actively involved in cell function and specialization. In addition, protein-coding RNA is transcribed from only 1-2% of the genome, whereas ncRNA covers ~70% of the genomic content and the majority of all cellular transcripts. The role of these transcripts in shaping different cell types and states remains poorly understood. Current techniques aimed at measuring ncRNA in single cells can only target a certain subset of noncoding transcripts, and no current method can simultaneously quantify all RNA types within a cell. Thus, the ability to map the regulatory connection between coding and noncoding transcripts within a cell is limited. This gap motivates the need for a novel single cell technology capable of assaying both poly(A)+ and poly(A)- RNA, irrespective of transcript length.\nStage of Development\nResearch –\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors developed a """"one-pot"""" scalable method designed to capture both coding and noncoding transcripts regardless of their length. This method, named Smart-seq-total, harnesses the template-switching capability of MMLV reverse transcriptase to generate full-length cDNA with high yield and quality. Smart-seq-total captures nonpolyadenylated RNA through template-independent addition of poly(A) tails, and further oligo-dT priming of all cellular transcripts, meaning all RNA molecules can also be tagged with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs).

Systematic mapping of these interactions provides key insights into vital cellular functions in both healthy and disease states. Current approaches to determining genome-wide interactions with a protein of interest (ChIP-Seq, CUT & RUN) were developed using short-read next generation sequencing (NGS), where short reads (~200bp) are mapped to a reference genome by stitching together uniquely overlapping sequencing reads. However, some highly repetitive regions of the human genome are unable to be correctly assembled using this technology because short repetitive sequences often lack unique overlaps that assembly algorithms rely upon. Long-read sequencing technology has made it possible to assemble some of these genomic regions for the first time as recently as 2020, and has elucidated their role key biological processes including chromosome segregation, nuclear organization, and transcriptional regulation. Additionally, current techniques rely on amplification-based readouts which have intrinsic biases and therefore only provide a semi-quantitative picture of protein-DNA interaction frequencies.\nStage of Development\nResearch-\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors of the new method, DiMeLo-Seq, establish a novel way to quantify DNA-protein interactions in previously unexplored, highly repetitive portions of the human genome. This method combines elements of previously established antibody-directed protein-DNA mapping techniques with nanopore sequencing to elucidate interactions. Briefly, cells are permeabilized and incubated with a primary antibody to target a DNA-interacting protein of interest. Next, a non-specific deoxyadenosine methyltransferase fused with antibody binding protein A (pA-Hia5) is allowed to bind to the primary antibody and all unbound pA-Hia5 is washed away. Nuclei are then incubated with methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which allows for adenosine methylation near the protein interaction of interest.

An ever-present threat of new pandemic viral strains like the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its related variants necessitates the development of more potent and protective vaccines. Scientists favor subunit vaccines that use representative pathogen fragments as antigens for their higher safety. Unfortunately, these subunit vaccines are hampered by their weak immunogenicity.

It is also shown in an ex vivo endothelial disease model that this TKI inhibits tube formation and proliferation in endothelial cells, suggesting it can also treat HHT by reducing angiogenesis.\nIncidence of PAH worldwide is 1 in every 20,000 to 60,000 individuals. Yet, only 15-20% of patients have the inherited form of the disease, caused mainly by loss-of-function mutation in the BMPR2 signaling pathway. In addition, there is evidence that BMPR2 expression and signaling is downregulated in other, non-hereditary forms of PAH as well.

About a fifth to a third of epilepsy patients are refractory to treatment, and many patients undergo intracranial neuromonitoring studies, involving surgically implanted electrodes in the brain, to localize their seizure source. Treatment options for patients with refractory focal epilepsy include surgical resection, laser ablation, vagal nerve stimulation, and responsive neurostimulation. However, there is no guarantee that a patient will become seizure-free with most of these treatments.

Further, they have developed cell-based models and a phenotypic assay for the development of integrin therapeutics.\nIntegrins proteins are the primary cell membrane receptors that mediate cell adhesion in mammals, anchoring the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrins, composed of an alpha and beta subunit with 24 known heterodimers, are essential for cell mechanotransduction, signaling, survival and migration. Dysregulation of integrin signaling contributes to the development of various diseases, making integrins key therapeutic targets in indications including thrombosis, autoimmune disorders, fibrotic diseases, microbial infections, and many types of cancer. While several integrin inhibitors are marketed drugs, therapeutic success has only been achieved for four integrin isoforms. Inhibitors targeting other integrin isoforms, particularly those in the alpha-v subfamily, which are indicated in cancers and fibrotic diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and nonalcoholic fatty liver syndrome (NASH), have faced significant challenges. In particular, inhibitors for alpha-v-containing integrins have demonstrated encouraging in vitro results, but have failed to show significant therapeutic benefits in clinical trials, despite their high safety profiles. The discrepancy between preclinical and clinical studies suggests that the preclinical models used in the drug discovery programs failed to accurately represent the in vivo physiology.\nThe inventors have discovered a new type of integrin function, called curved adhesion. To date, focal adhesions have been the most widely studied integrin-mediated cell adhesions likely due to their formation on ECM-coated flat surfaces, such as in 2D cell culture. Focal adhesions, which are driven by mechanical tension and require high substrate rigidity, were believed to be the dominant adhesion structure and were the primary target for integrin therapeutic development. However, ECM in tissues is largely composed of entangled protein fibers that are often too soft to support the assembly of focal adhesions. Curved adhesions, in contrast, are driven by membrane curvature instead of mechanical tension and can thus anchor cells to soft ECM fibers. Curved adhesions can co-exist with focal adhesions but are structurally and functionally distinct. In particular, curved adhesions are exclusively mediated by the alpha-v beta-5 integrin isoform, which is upregulated in many cancers and fibrotic diseases. The present studies indicate that curved adhesions dominate in 3D physiological environments. Therefore, targeting curved adhesions rather than focal adhesions offers a promising route towards the discovery of effective integrin drugs, particularly those for alpha-v-containing isoforms.\nThis technology presents a new platform to induce formation of curved adhesions in cell culture for the discovery of integrin therapeutics targeting curved adhesions. Additionally, it provides a proximity-based phenotypic assay for detecting curved adhesion inhibitors in high throughput screens.\nFigure 1.

They have developed innovative cell-based models and a phenotypic assay to facilitate the creation of integrin therapeutics. Integrins, important proteins that regulate cell adhesion by connecting the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, play critical roles in various cellular processes. Dysregulation of integrin signaling is linked to numerous diseases, making them essential targets for therapeutic interventions. Despite existing integrin inhibitors on the market, the success has been limited to only four isoforms, particularly for those in the alpha-v subfamily, which are relevant for diseases like cancer and fibrosis. Although in vitro results for inhibitors targeting alpha-v-containing integrins are promising, these therapies have not translated to significant effectiveness in clinical trials.

Our ability to form new oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for myelin formation, declines as we age, limiting the capacity to replace myelin loss. Therefore, oligodendrocyte rejuvenation in the elderly is a promising strategy for disease treatment.\nOligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) from which oligodendrocytes arise rely on growth factors supplied by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for their function. Age-related changes in the brain result in lower OPC support, resulting in inefficient myelin turnover and axonal damage. However, re-exposure of aged brains to young CSF induces OPC proliferation and maturation to oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus. Young CSF achieves this by inducing Serum Response Factor (SRF) signaling via the Fgf8 sub-family of Fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs), which consists of Fgf8/17/18. Among these, only Fgf17 has similar effects on progenitor proliferation, maturation, and long-term memory as young CSF.

While a powerful method for characterizing intact protein structure, the quality of data acquired during TD-MS is highly dependent on the sample preparation. To prepare samples for MS analysis, protein analytes are typically purified from complex biological mixtures using an affinity (or immunoaffinity) capture technique on beads or resin. Yet, conventional affinity capture lacks real-time process monitoring, making optimization of sample preparation in case of weak or absent MS signal challenging. Alternatively, Biolayer Interferometry (BLI), a label-free optical sensing technology, is widely used to study the kinetics and affinity of real-time biomolecular interactions. BLI necessarily monitors the affinity capture of analytes in real-time, but cannot provide any structural information on the captured binding partners. Thus, the combination of BLI and TD-MS can provide both real-time monitoring of protein capture and structural identification. However, development of a seamless coupling method between these two technologies has been hindered by the small sample quantity that can be captured on the BLI microprobe tips.\nTo address this challenge, this technology directly couples BLI with HR-MS with a method called Microprobe-Capture In-Emitter Elution (MPIE). To implement MPIE, the analyte is first captured on the surface of a microprobe (Figure 1A), the microprobe is directly inserted into an electrospray emitter, and the analyte is eluted by spraying into a mass spectrometer for HR-MS analysis (Figure 1B). In comparison to conventional affinity capture techniques such as bead-based immunoprecipitation, MPIE introduces real-time process monitoring and provides binding characteristics of analytes, offering more information-rich experimental results.\nFigure 1.

This approach enables real-time monitoring of protein analyte capture while also allowing for in-depth structural information on intact proteins, including details on post-translational modifications and proteoform variation. Conventional sample preparation often relies on affinity capture methods that lack real-time feedback, making it difficult to optimize conditions when there are issues with MS signal. The integration of BLI, which tracks the affinity capture of analytes without labels, with TD-MS addresses this limitation.

Addressing this issue, Stanford researchers have developed a device and descriptive system for quantitative assessment of orbital soft tissue restriction called STORM. This medical device measures resistance of eye movement to locate soft tissue impingement and adhesions in surgical and diagnostic settings. In addition, to more precisely measuring restrictions, the resulting heat map identifies the location of the adhesion/entrapment.\nStage of Development\n\nApplications: Orbital fractures (especially complex repairs in conjunction with large and/or custom implants), Orbital reconstruction following skull base or sinus surgery, Thyroid eye disease, Congenital myopathy and fibrosis syndromes, 3rd nerve palsy and other large angle strabismus syndromes.\n\nAdvantages: Quantitative measurement of orbital soft tissue restriction to locate soft tissue impingement and adhesions in surgical and diagnostic settings, Generates heat map which identifies the location of the adhesion/entrapment, High clinical efficacy, Easily applied by all surgeons (majority of orbital fractures are also repaired by surgeons without ophthalmic training), Addresses gap in market space, The closest competitor that we are aware of is a functional first generation prototype developed by our team that contains a load cell within force-sensing forceps manipulated by the surgeon, with translation of the instrument measured by an inertia monitoring unit (IMU) that combines the capacity of an accelerometer and gyroscope, theoretically permitting proxy positional assessment by measurement of speed and linear acceleration about three axes.

Optimal scalable diagnostic tests are fast, cheap, highly accurate, and can be completed at home. While polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are the gold standard for accuracy, they are slow, expensive, and must be performed in specialized laboratory facilities. Antigen-detection tests are lower in cost and portable, but often sacrifice accuracy. Tests for genetic material based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) have gained traction due to their lower cost and faster speed, but comparable accuracy to PCR tests. LAMP is a method of DNA detection that enables rapid amplification of a specific gene at constant temperature. Negating the need for variable temperatures, as is required for PCR tests, increases the scalability and application of LAMP tests to higher volumes and lower resource facilities. However, LAMP amplification has been typically paired with fluorescence based or colorimetric readouts, which requires costly detection instrumentation, making the application to ultra-cheap, disposable, and/or widespread at home tests challenging.\nThis technology uses a similar amplification strategy to LAMP, but instead of colorimetric detection, relies on an electrical impedance measurement as the detection output. This is achieved by adding a compaction component to DNA amplification which folds the amplified DNA into micron-sized nanoballs. The presence of these nanoballs can then be directly detected by changes in impedance when the nanoballs flow through a microfluidic channel. The ease of detection for electrical signals along with the high accuracy of DNA amplification enables the technology to be applied to cheap, fast, and portable devices for high accuracy diagnostic tests for infectious diseases.\nStage of Development: Prototype\n\nApplications: Infectious disease diagnostic testing, At home diagnostic tests.\n\nAdvantages: Reaction occurs at constant temperature (as opposed to PCR which requires thermocycling), Fast detection (~15-30 mins), Cheaper cost per sample compared to PCR, antigen, colorimetric LAMP, etc., High accuracy (comparable with PCR tests), Test compatible with saliva in addition to swab-based sample collection (compared to colorimetric tests in which saliva often interferes), Portable and compatible with at home use.","**Summary:** Researchers from several prestigious institutions have created an innovative technique for detecting pathogenic genetic material quickly and inexpensively. Their method utilizes electrical impedance measurement of DNA nanoballs that have been amplified, improving the speed and cost-effectiveness of diagnostics while maintaining good accuracy. Traditional approaches, such as PCR tests, are known for their high accuracy but are limited by their cost, speed, and need for specialized lab environments. Although LAMP offers a faster and more affordable alternative, its reliance on complex detection methods has hindered its application in ultra-cheap and home diagnostic tests.

**Applications:** This technology has the potential to be employed in a variety of diagnostic settings, particularly in public health, where fast and economical tests for infectious diseases are vital. It could facilitate the development of widely accessible home testing kits, allowing for timely and accurate detection of viral and bacterial infections.

**Problem Solved:** The developed method effectively addresses the limitations of traditional diagnostic tests by providing a rapid, cost-effective, and accurate means of identifying pathogenic infections.

In recent years, organoids of human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells have provided an in vitro model to study brain development and disorders. While self-organized organoids can be generated that resemble different brain regions (such as human cortical organoids, (hCO)), the in vitro models lack the microenvironments or sensory inputs that are present in a living brain. Thus, in vitro organoids fail to provide an understanding of brain function, including neural circuits, behavioral outputs, and neuropsychiatric disease phenotypes.\nThis technology successfully integrates human organoids into intact, living brains of developing rats to create an in vivo model of human neural development and function (Figure 1). The transplantation is performed several days after birth when the rat brains still have developmental plasticity. Early introduction enables the transplanted organoid (t-hCO) to anatomically and functionally integrate into the rat brain, creating working hybrid neural circuits. The resulting mature t-hCO neurons are able to respond to external sensory stimuli and can drive behavioral responses. The ability to transplant a broad spectrum of hiPS cell derived organoids offers this platform broad application to the study and therapeutic testing for many human neuropsychiatric disorders.\nFigure Description: Transplantation of human cortical organoids into the developing rat cortex.

Additionally, it may aid in drug testing and the development of therapies aimed at treating various neurological disorders.

**Problem Solved:** This approach addresses the significant challenge of studying human neurological diseases due to the lack of suitable animal models and limited availability of human brain tissue. By creating a living model that mimics human neural development and function, researchers can gain deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying brain disorders and explore potential treatments in a more accurate biological context.","Researchers from Stanford University have developed an in vivo model to study human neural development and neuropsychiatric disorders.

"Stanford University","Minimally Invasive Neochord Devices for Mitral Valve Repair","Docket #: S20-202","","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/minimally-invasive-neochord-devices-mitral-valve-repair","Stanford researchers have developed two novel, minimally invasive neochordal devices for mitral valve repair. The first, described in S19-432, is a high-impact, minimally invasive, percutaneous, transcatheter device that does not require open heart surgery nor cardiopulmonary bypass. It is administered percutaneously, entering the venous system, targeting the mitral valve through the atrial septum. This approach allows for direct positioning of a neochord spanning the mitral leaflet and left ventricular myocardium, a surgery known as posterior ventricular anchoring neochordal (PVAN) repair. This technology is far superior to existing transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair technologies because it aims at percutaneously implanting a neochord, as opposed to creating a double-orifice valve, as double orifice valves have been shown to increase harmful stenosis and forces on the valvular system. This technique replicates the gold standard, neochordal repair procedure, while edge-to-edge repair recapitulates an outdated technique that leads to worse outcomes. Moreover, the shorter neochord lengths due to the posterior ventricular targeting has been shown to reduce chordal forces on the valve, leading to a potentially more durable repair.\nThe second device is a neochord anchoring prosthetic for transapical off-pump mitral valve repair. The device is an elastic post inserted into the apex of the heart following neochord leaflet attachment. This device, functioning like an artificial papillary muscle, serves as an anchor for one or more neochordae. The elasticity and shortened neochord lengths mitigate the elevated chordal stresses associated with apical anchoring, aiming to reducing chordal forces and neochord pull out frequency and minimizing blood leakage.\nDr. Joseph Woo, renowned chairman and surgeon of Stanford Cardiothoracic Surgery, invented these devices and the PVAN procedure, which has been shown to provide tremendous repair results and patient outcomes. Moreover, recent studies have shown that shorter neochord lengths, accomplished with posterior left ventricular targeting and elastic transapical anchors, result in reduced forces on the neochordae and surrounding existing chordal architecture, translating to very low failure rates, reduced fatigue damage, greater repair durability, and outstanding patient outcomes. The inventions directly address some of the largest concerns regarding treatment of one of the most prevalent valvular diseases in the world, enabling a higher quality repair without the trauma of major surgery nor the rare expertise of surgeons from high volume treatment centers and leveraging advanced, minimally invasive technologies of the future.\nStage of Development:\nProof of Concept\n\nApplications: Percutaneous, transcatheter, neochordal mitral valve repair in a beating heart, Stand-alone medical device for implanting artificial chordae with any beating heart, Concomitant implanted medical device for improving transapical neochordal repair biomechanics and outcomes.\n\nAdvantages: -High quality repair technique: These devices are associated with a repair and not valve replacement, preserving the native structures and biomechanics as much as possible., -Reduced chordal strains: Shorter length neochordae result in reduced strain in the neochord and surrounding chordal architecture, translating to reduce fatigue and increased durability of the repair, -Low failure rates: Reduced strains directly result in reduced failure and increased durability., -PVAN is an entirely percutaneous and minimally invasive: Percutaneous approach facilitates a minimally invasive technique, which improves recovery times and reduces surgical complications., -Transcatheter delivery method: the invention leverages futuristic transcatheter approaches, which allows for wide adoption and clear avenues for robotic integration and manipulation..","**Summary:** Stanford researchers have developed two innovative minimally invasive neochordal devices designed for mitral valve repair.

MDMA's therapeutic mechanism derives from its ability to foster feelings of empathy, and there is no other drug in clinical use that known to have this effect. While this breakthrough promises great potential in helping psychiatric patients, MDMA also has significant abuse potential, cardiotoxicity and potential neurotoxicity. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify novel compounds with empathogenic effects and a more favorable side effect profile. Existing drug screening platforms for such drugs primarily rely on in vitro screens of receptor affinity, and preclinical behavioral assays which are not specific for prosocial or empathogen-like effects.\nStanford scientists have developed a new screening methodology which involves both a novel set of behavioral assays that are specific for prosocial behaviors in mice, and a novel application of ex vivo brain imaging that detects patterns of brain circuit activation. The behavioral screening assays are a combination of the 3-chamber assay, social conditioned place preference assay, and the social transfer of pain assay. The brain imaging assay uses techniques adapted from human neuroimaging to detect drug and behavior-dependent expression of a gene that reflects neural activity. This suite of assays could identify novel empathogenic drugs, presenting a route to new potential breakthrough treatments for PTSD and other psychiatric disorders with more favorable side effect profiles.\nStage of Development:\nInventors have performed initial validation steps for the circuit mapping and are continuing to validate behavioral assays used to detect novel empathogens.\n\nApplications: Drug screening platform for novel empathogens, which have applications in treating disorders like PTSD.\n\nAdvantages: Can detect empathogens that would be overlooked by current screening methodologies, Finds potential therapies with empathogenic qualities that have already proven useful in treating PTSD in clinical trials.","**Summary:** Stanford scientists have created a series of preclinical assays aimed at identifying empathogenic effects of drugs, which have the potential to aid in the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

In particular, these molecules could be used in a rescue inhaler.\nDrug format - Small molecule (analogs of catecholamine type compounds such as isoprenaline, adrenaline and noradrenaline).\nDrug class - Improvement of existing class of bronchodilators.\nResearch stage and Preliminary data - The inventors have validated the compounds in vitro, demonstrating 100-fold selectivity for the β2-AR over the β1-AR in a radioligand binding assay, and 1000-fold selectively for the β2-AR over the β1-AR in an arrestin recruitment assay.\nTarget - Beta-2 adrenergic receptor (β2-AR).\nBackground - The adrenergic family of receptors are the primary points of action for the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. The receptors are divided into two subfamilies (α and β) which differ in ligand specificity, expression in tissues, and downstream signaling. In particular, activating β2-AR induces relaxation of airway smooth muscle. Thus, compounds that target β2-AR have been used as bronchodilators to treat various respiratory diseases including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). In contrast, β1-AR is highly expressed in the heart and activating this AR can lead to elevated blood pressure, exacerbate coronary artery disease and cause arrhythmias. Therefore, if βAR drugs are not selective, they activate β1-AR along with β2-AR, causing severe and unwanted side effects in asthma or COPD therapy.\nMode of action - These compounds are analogs of adrenaline and noradrenaline which activate β2-AR with high selectivity over β1-AR. They are short-acting β2-AR agonists that can dilate airways in the lungs. In addition, the β2 selectivity, makes them potential candidates for treating heart failure.\nCompetitive edge - These compounds could greatly reduce the risk of cardiovascular side effects (e.g., arrhythmia, elevated blood pressure) compared to traditional bronchodilators that target the β2-AR. The molecules are 100 to 1000-fold selective for β2-AR over β1-AR whereas current therapies (e.g., salbutamol) are only 20-fold selective.

Glaucoma comprises progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells. Degeneration of these nerves results in cupping, a characteristic appearance of the optic disc, and visual loss. Currently, glaucoma is treated by lowering intraocular pressure. However, this strategy is not always effective. Another possible way to treat glaucoma is by preventing neurodegeneration in glaucoma through neuroprotective HDAC4.

Physiological concentrations of different plasma proteins can vary considerably, spanning over 10 orders of magnitude. Current methods rely upon sample splitting and differential dilutions, which are vulnerable to issues arising from non-linear dilutions (NLD). NLD describes the phenomenon wherein measured concentrations of a given analyte deviate greatly from their expected values when measured at different dilutions. The effects of NLD can be dramatic, and there is currently no single assay that can quantify both low- and high-abundance proteins simultaneously from a single sample.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a tunable proximity assay, EVROS, that can overcome the problems arising from NLD. The EVROS method is based on paired oligonucleotide-tagged affinity reagent detection of target analytes; when two detection reagents simultaneously bind to the same target molecule, barcoded DNA strands can undergo a ligation reaction in the presence of a complementary """"hybridization splint"""" DNA strand. Ligated and barcoded nucleic acids can be further amplified and detected by high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Importantly, EVROS introduces two independent tuning strategies to modulate the signal response curve of each analyte individually. First, a probe loading strategy ensures that similar signals are produced for all targets, regardless of abundance. Second, an epitope depletion strategy (i.e., introduction of a pool of depletant antibodies) shifts the binding curve of the detection reagents to match the physiological concentration range of the target. These two tuning mechanisms can be applied to many types of immunoassays. The inventors demonstrate the power of EVROS over the Luminex approach in solid phase proximity ligation assay (spPLA) format to simultaneously quantify four different proteins with physiological concentrations ranging from low femtomolar to high nanomolar – a dynamic range spanning seven orders of magnitude in a single 5 µL sample of undiluted serum.\nStage of Development\nResearch – in vitro\n\nApplications: Multiplexed quantification of disparate analyte concentrations from small starting sample volumes (e.g., biomarker discovery, disease monitoring, blood testing in neonates or biobanked samples)..\n\nAdvantages: Tunable EVROS assay has a wide dynamic range, capable of determining the concentration of multiple analytes in a sample, even if the analytes are present at very different concentration levels, EVROS requires only 5 µL of sample, spPLA format includes polyclonal antibodies that are divided into pools for each target analyte (e.g. unlabeled depletant antibodies, detection antibodies, target capture antibodies), eliminating the need to screen multiple sets of monoclonal antibodies, Affinity reagents can be combination of antibodies, aptamers and nanobodies.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford have developed a tunable proximity assay capable of detecting multiple analytes within a single sample, offering a wide dynamic range.

Such biosensors are typically based on aptamers that undergo a reversible structure-switching mechanism that is coupled to a detectable readout. Unfortunately, it remains a challenge to generate novel aptamer switches, because most aptamers assume a stably folded structure and do not undergo a binding-induced conformation change. Most approaches to engineer aptamer switches rely on rational design and require prior knowledge of aptamer structure. Such detailed structural characterization has only been achieved for a relatively small number of aptamers. Furthermore, even the most advanced modeling software fails to account for non-canonical base-pairing or can correctly predict three-dimensional folding, which can be critical for target recognition and binding.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a system for rapid and massively parallel screening of different switch scaffolds in a single experiment, circumventing the need for rational design. Building upon their recently developed non-natural aptamer array (N2A2) system, the method enables the synthesis and screening of an array of fluorophore-labeled anchored displacement strand (ADS) switch constructs directly onto the flow-cell of a modified Illumina MiSeq instrument. Target-responsive molecular switches are identified by sequential imaging of flow-cell with and without the target molecule, and signal from library members can be linked to their nucleotide sequence by the location of the signal. Imaging data from each ADS construct cluster reveals the presence of switches for which target binding results in increase (signal-on) or decreased (signal-off) fluorescence.

Ultrasound neuromodulation using one or two transducers have been designed previously, but high pressure needs to be applied to achieve stronger modulation, causing tissue damage due to cavitation. The Khuri-Yakub group designed PIRF, which maximize radiation force by situating two transducers oppose from one another to generate a standing wave that can stimulate neural tissues with far less energy. However, this method still has limited spatial resolution, and the position of the target or the transducer need to be moved mechanically to modulate a different area.\nThe group has therefore developed an improved PIRF system using a chirp waveform in which the frequency changes with time instead of a single waveform. Chirp excitation remarkably reduces the size of stimulation spot and allows for high spatial regulation. In addition, the modulation spot can be moved electronically rather than mechanically by correcting in proportion to time delays, which decrease the technical barriers associated with current neuromodulation methods. This new neuromodulation device can be readily implemented into current medical equipment as well as other fields where ultrasonic stimulation is required.\n\nApplications: Medical equipment for neuromodulation and nerve stimulation for various disorders such as Parkinson's, Tourette syndrome and epilepsy, Ultrasonic stimulation of other parts of the body where spatial resolution is required, Other fields where acoustic radiation force (ARF) is used (ex. particle manipulation, acoustic tweezers, etc), Implementation of PIRF with chirp waveform into general focused transducers.\n\nAdvantages: Greater radiation force with the same acoustic pressure, Reduced damage caused by heat and cavitation from pressure, Reduced stimulation spot size with chirp waveform, Improved spatial resolution with chirp waveform compared to the previous generation PIRF, Precise movement of modulation spot inside the body electrically, Easy implementation into existing transducers by changing the input signal to chirp waveform.","**Summary:** Stanford researchers from the Khuri-Yakub group have developed a high spatial resolution ultrasonic neuromodulation device that utilizes a chirp waveform for pattern interference radiation force (PIRF). This approach overcomes the limitations of previous ultrasonic neuromodulation techniques, which required high pressure and often resulted in tissue damage through cavitation. The new system employs two transducers positioned opposite each other to create a standing wave, allowing neural tissues to be stimulated with significantly lower energy. The introduction of chirp excitation not only minimizes the size of the stimulation spot but also enables electronic modulation of the spot's position, thus addressing the mechanical movement challenges prevalent in current methods.

**Applications:** This technology has potential applications in medical equipment for neuromodulation and nerve stimulation aimed at treating various disorders. Additionally, it may find utility in fields requiring ultrasonic stimulation.

**Problem Solved:** The new device offers a solution to the issues of high energy requirements and tissue damage associated with traditional ultrasonic neuromodulation methods.

Researchers at Stanford have developed a method for quantitative assessment of neonatal health using dried blood spot metabolite profiles and deep learning. Prematurity is associated with significant newborn health risks, including intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Current diagnosis and treatment of the latter three conditions are reactive to the occurrence and onset of typical symptoms. Moreover, current classification methods for preterm birth (gestational age and birthweight) can vary widely with regard to adverse health outcomes and thus of limited value for risk stratification. To create a more comprehensive approach, the Stanford team linked quantitative metabolite results from routine newborn screening (NBS) dried blood spots representing over 40,000 livebirths to clinical outcomes. Using deep learning, NBS metabolites were condensed into a metabolic health index predicting the likelihood of suffering from the four adverse neonatal outcomes described above.

"Stanford University","Vactosertib (small molecule inhibitor of the TGF-beta pathway) for the treatment of ventilator induced diaphragm dysfunction","Docket #: S21-337","","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/vactosertib-small-molecule-inhibitor-tgf-beta-pathway-treatment-ventilator-induced","Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a widely used treatment modality for the management of respiratory failure in intensive care units (ICU). An estimated 300,000 patients undergo MV annually in the U.S. In these patients, timely extubation promotes improved health outcomes and minimizes the risk of important complications such as pneumonia, delirium, gastrointestinal bleeding, and death. Progressive and dramatic diaphragm weakness and atrophy can result from MV, called ventilator induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD), beginning after as little as 2 days of MV. VIDD is characterized by the early reduction in the ability of the diaphragm to generate force in the absence of atrophy, and later development of frank diaphragm muscle fiber atrophy. It has also been established that VIDD is an important driver of failure to wean patients from MV.\nPrevention of VIDD is likely to reduce ICU stay, complications, and mortality in ventilated patients. The Shrager lab has demonstrated that components of the TGF-beta pathway, specifically Smad3, are critical to the development of VIDD in rats. Use of a Smad3 inhibitor prevented VIDD in rats in a published study. The inventors hypothesized that administering Vactosertib to patients undergoing MV would disrupt diaphragm dysfunction and atrophy and thereby promote timely extubation. The novel treatment method would likely decrease ventilator days and resultant complications and deaths stemming from intubation and MV. It would have the potential to become a drug widely used in the management of ICU patients requiring MV. There are no medications currently approved for the treatment of diaphragm dysfunction or atrophy related to mechanical ventilation. While device-based approaches exist, these are cumbersome and invasive. The novel method of inhibiting Smad3 is simple enough to be used as a prophylactic.\n\nApplications: If approved by the FDA, this drug would ideally be given to intubated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) to reduce ventilator days and related complications.\n\nAdvantages: There is currently no approved drug for the treatment of diaphragm atrophy related to mechanical ventilation, Less invasive and less complex method compared to currently available methods (transvenous stimulation device).","**Summary:** Vactosertib is a small molecule inhibitor of the TGF-beta pathway that has been proposed for treating ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD) in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. VIDD is a condition characterized by diaphragm weakness and atrophy, which can develop rapidly within days of mechanical ventilation. Experimental studies indicate that inhibiting the Smad3 component of the TGF-beta pathway has the potential to prevent VIDD, promoting better diaphragm function and enabling more timely extubation.

**Applications:** The technology aims to improve outcomes for patients receiving mechanical ventilation in intensive care units by preventing diaphragm dysfunction. If successful, it could lead to a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation, diminished incidence of complications associated with prolonged intubation, and improved overall mortality rates in critically ill patients.

**Problem Solved:** The use of Vactosertib seeks to address the critical issue of ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction, which can contribute to extended ICU stays, increased risk of complications such as pneumonia and delirium, and higher mortality rates in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. By mitigating VIDD, the treatment could facilitate quicker recovery and extubation, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes in critical care settings.","Mechanical ventilation is a common treatment for respiratory failure in intensive care units, with approximately 300,000 patients undergoing the procedure annually in the U.S. Prolonged mechanical ventilation can lead to ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction, resulting in significant diaphragm weakness and atrophy."
"Stanford University","Acute and Chronic Pain Suppression through Targeted Peripheral Nerve Application of Focused Ultrasound","Docket #: S17-430","Published Application: WO2022266261, Published Application: 20240115887","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/acute-and-chronic-pain-suppression-through-targeted-peripheral-nerve-application-focused","Stanford researchers have developed method for targeted application focused ultrasound to peripheral nerves to suppress acute pain.\nThe prevalence of acute pain is high across multiple other healthcare settings, including inpatient wards, emergency departments, and postoperative units. Acute pain from any injury is frequently inadequately managed; yet, poorly controlled acute pain is associated with significant morbidity. Moderate-severe acute pain is associated with increased risk of developing myocardial ischemia, impaired pulmonary function, ileus, thromboembolism, impaired immune function, infection, and anxiety.\nIn the US, 100 million patients undergo inpatient and outpatient surgery each year. The vast majority of patients experience pain after surgery, and up to 75% of patients will have moderate-severe pain on the day of surgery. Of the 100 million emergency department (ED) visits in the U.S. each year, acute pain is also one of the most common complaints. Two out of three of ED patients with pain report it as moderate-severe, and yet, only half experience adequate pain relief. Among inpatient adults, up to 80% experience pain and 40% experience severe pain during their hospitalization. Extremity injuries (trauma and surgical) are common reasons for presentation to emergency department and for surgical intervention, and are associated with a high incidence of moderate-to-severe pain, prolonged opioid use, and chronic pain. Acute pain after surgery and trauma typically improves markedly within 2 weeks, but mild-moderate pain often persists for many weeks.\nCurrent acute pain treatment approaches generally fall into two broad categories: of systemic pain medications (often opioids) and neuromodulating techniques, such as peripheral nerve blockade (PNB) with local anesthetics. Opioids remain among the most commonly used medications for acute pain management; in fact, 40-50% of all inpatients receive opioids during hospitalization. However, opioids are associated with a myriad of adverse outcomes, both short- and long-term. Short-term adverse effects of opioids include respiratory depression, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, and ileus, which worsen patient outcomes and increase patient care costs. Long-term negative effects of acute opioid administration include prolonged opioid use, high-risk opioid use, and the CP development. Further, chronic opioid use after traumatic injury, surgery, and hospitalization is frequent. Long-term opioid use is also associated with an increased risk of developing a large number of negative outcomes, including immunologic and hormonal dysfunction, neurocognitive deficits, hyperalgesia, suicide, and death. Additionally, opioids preferentially inhibit C-fibers over A-delta fibers and thus are better at controlling dull, burning, or rest pain, but not sharp or movement pain. Yet, despite not adequately managing pain, opioids are still widely utilized for acute pain therapy. In fact, more than 70% of surgical patients fill an opioid prescription after surgery, and more than 50% of trauma patients receive an opioid prescription upon discharge. While peripheral nerve blockade (PNB) decreases acute pain in many settings, peripheral nerve blocks have important limitations which have led to their under-utilization in trauma and surgical settings. While only inhibition of pain fibers (A-delta and C fibers) is needed, local anesthetics also block motor (A-alpha) fibers and non-pain sensory (A-beta) fibers, which may increase the risk of patient injury from falls and prevent early participation in physical therapy. Further, while the use of diagnostic ultrasound to find peripheral nerves is straightforward, PNBs can be technically difficult due to the challenges of perineural needle placement. Thus, anesthesiologists' PNB training is complex with expanding requirements for subspecialty training. Additionally, the time required for PNBs is often negatively perceived by surgeons and healthcare providers due to the risk of delays. Single-shot PNBs (single injection of local anesthetic) are short-lived (24 hours) and may result in rebound pain after cessation. Continuous PNBs (a percutaneous indwelling catheter is inserted with the tip next to a nerve for continuous or intermittent local anesthetic infusion) typically last 3-5 days, but require significant clinical follow-up for the provider/patient, and an increasing risk of catheter infection with a greater duration. Additionally, local anesthetic systemic toxicity, with a mortality rate of 10%, is a risk when local anesthetics are injected during PNB.\nPain after trauma and surgeries commonly is moderate-to-severe for 1-2 weeks after the injury and surgery. The vast majority of patients have poorly controlled acute pain during this period, which worsens patient outcomes.\nUltrasonography was developed in the 1940s to image tissue transcutaneously; diagnostic ultrasound energy delivery to imaged tissues is low. Ultrasound waves pass through human soft tissues with known attenuation factors for each tissue, enabling transcutaneous, (noninvasive) application to both superficial and deep tissues. Similarly to light waves, ultrasound waves can be focused to areas of varying size (relatively easily from 1mm to several mm in diameter) by using a concave transducer, delivering energy noninvasively to a target tissue, and having minimal impact on surrounding tissues. This focused ultrasound (FUS) can be used to deliver 4-6 orders of magnitude greater energy to tissues then is delivered by imaging ultrasound; depending on the FUS parameters used, the energy is transferred to tissue as thermal and mechanical energy. With magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guidance, high intensity FUS is used clinically as a noninvasive technique to safely ablate tissue, e.g., prostate cancer and uterine fibroids. Lower intensity FUS can be used for clinical purposes, non-permanently altering tissues.\nCurrently, FUS is widely investigated for its potential in modulating the central nervous system, specifically to treat diseases such as essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, neuropathic pain, and depression. Advantages of FUS for transcranial neuromodulation include the ability to noninvasively target deep brain regions, its ability to be directed at very specific and small areas of the brain, and its lack of ionizing radiation. There is increasing evidence that FUS may be an optimal tool for treating peripheral pain conditions. Prior investigations have also studied the effect of FUS on the peripheral nervous system (PNS), finding dose-dependent reversible or permanent reduction in peripheral nerve action potential (AP) amplitudes across different ex vivo and in vivo animal models. Investigators have postulated that FUS may be used to manage some pain conditions, and animal studies suggest further potential for this purpose. However, published investigations into FUS's utility for acute pain management are lacking from the scientific literature.\nInjected liposomal bupivacaine, for PNB and local infiltration at the surgical site, was developed to provide extended duration pain management. However, a recent meta-analysis concluded that liposomal bupivacaine does not significantly extend pain relief compared to non-liposomal bupivacaine. ATX-101, a phase II investigational sustained release local anesthetic-polymer, has also been proposed as an adjustable duration for local infiltration and peripheral nerve blockade. However, injection of local anesthetics is invasive and requires a high level of training to safely guide a needle to a peripheral nerve. Additionally, local anesthetics are direct neurotoxins, and exposure of peripheral nerves to local anesthetics beyond 48-72 hours results in increasing nerve injury (although without known clinically-relevant adverse effects).\nThe Anderson lab has investigated FUS's potential for acute pain suppression and found that using a distinct set of parameters, FUS 1) preferentially inhibits pain fibers over motor fibers and 2) blocks acute pain for 1-2 weeks after injury.\nFUS appears to be a promising modality for reversibly inhibiting peripheral nociceptive fibers without the need for systemic, addicting pharmacologic agents (i.e., opioids). FUS has the benefits of regional anesthesia and 1) is noninvasive, obviating the risk of infection; 2) eliminates the need for local anesthetics which inhibit motor fibers and have potential for systemic toxicity; 3) differentially inhibits nociceptive fibers over motor fibers, thus is unlikely to reduce PT participation or increase the risk of falls; 4) would require significantly less training and post-procedural care to utilize than regional anesthesia; 5) potentially could be employed as early in the chain of care as the battlefield triage station; and 6) may decrease the risk of developing chronic pain after trauma, and thus, reducing CP-associated morbidities (i.e. substance use disorder).\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Acute pain treatment using a distinct set of FUS parameters intermittently or in a pulsatile form.\n\nAdvantages: No other focused ultrasound device or procedure currently exists for peripheral nervous system neuromodulation to suppress acute pain., The current focused ultrasound method is a desirable alternative to opioid drug treatment for pain treatment., The device and procedure are noninvasive, The current device and method are a non-drug-based method for pain suppression..","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford have developed a method utilizing focused ultrasound for the targeted application to peripheral nerves, aimed at suppressing acute pain. This new approach addresses the inadequacy of current pain management techniques that leave many patients suffering from moderate to severe pain following injuries or surgery.

It is particularly relevant for patients undergoing surgeries, as well as those presenting with extremity injuries, where acute pain is commonly reported.

Acting synergistically, this architecture achieves high selectivity and conversion efficiency for partial oxidation of methane to form methanol and other oxygenates at room temperature. Direct conversion of methane to methanol and other partial oxidation products is one of the most scientifically challenging problems in chemistry that, if solved, has significant implications for the clean energy economy. With millions of tons of methane being wasted through venting and flaring, its conversion to valuable chemicals and liquid fuels and its ability to displace carbon-rich fuels such as coal, jet fuel, diesel and gasoline could substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, methane's high C-H bond strength, negligible electron affinity and low polarizability pose a high activation barrier. In addition, partially oxygenated products such as methanol and formaldehyde are more reactive than methane and thus are prone to over-oxidation to CO2. Consequently, direct methane to methanol conversion is often faced with a trade-off between CH4 conversion efficiency and methanol selectivity. New catalysts that can directly convert methane to methanol and other oxygenates under mild conditions with both high conversion and selectivity would greatly reduce the carbon footprint of the current industrial two-step methanol production process.\nStructure of the new photocatalysts for methane partial oxidation at room temperature.

The former approach suffers from sub-optimal performance, while the latter typically employs complex designs that require high fabrication time, effort, and cost. Moreover, with either of these approaches the operating frequency is fixed by geometric design decisions and scaling the system to incorporate large transducer arrays is particularly challenging due to inevitable process variations when using MEMS devices. Aside from the above challenges, all resonant transducers also have an inherent tradeoff between sensitivity and bandwidth, wherein one can either achieve high sensitivity or wide bandwidth but not both simultaneously.\nTo address these problems, Stanford researchers have developed a method that shifts complexity from custom transducer/MEMS fabrication to intelligent electronics instead, increasing system performance by overcoming the sensitivity-bandwidth limit and allowing for robust, reconfigurable, and cost-effective system scaling. This is accomplished through two all-electronic tuning circuits: 1) a tunable negative capacitance that can be utilized to shift the transducer to a desired resonance frequency while canceling any parasitic capacitance to maintain high sensitivity and combat process variations and 2) a tunable resistance that electronically dampens transducer resonance and increases bandwidth at the desired resonance frequency. Together, they provide an exclusively electronic means for tuning the transducer's resonance frequency, sensitivity, and bandwidth on the fly depending upon application requirements. Thus, with the proposed solution, one could use conventional, easy-to-fabricate transducers while employing the electronic tuning knobs to enable high-performance, yet highly reconfigurable ultrasonic sensing systems for a variety of applications ranging from medical ultrasound, non-destructive testing, and air-coupled sensing.\nFigure Description: Via the negative capacitance tuning technology described, the inventors are able to attain high sensitivity at all frequencies (source: inventors).\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Time-of-flight based applications like ultrasound localization, ranging, and distance estimation, Medical ultrasound, Non-destructive testing, Non-contact 1D, 2D and 3D ultrasound sensing and imaging in air, Cross-medium imaging\n\nAirborne sonar imaging (water-to-air)\nUnderground mapping (soil-to-air)\nMedical imaging (tissue-to-air), Airborne sonar imaging (water-to-air), Underground mapping (soil-to-air), Medical imaging (tissue-to-air).\n\nAdvantages: High sensitivity, wideband transducer response, Single device for high performance across frequencies (versus needing multiple devices), Simple fabrication with electronic compensation of any process variations to enable robust, low-noise MEMS-electronics integration.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford have created a programmable tuning circuit that enables dynamic electronic adjustment of ultrasound transducers' resonance frequency, sensitivity, and bandwidth.

Many PBM devices utilize light sources that flicker at particular frequencies (that is, they oscillate between an on and off state at that frequency).

Further, the mutant site needs to be edited with near perfect efficiency to prevent the eventual expansion of the proliferative mutant populations.\nInventors at Stanford's Porteus lab have developed a CRISPR-based method in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to deactivate the JAK2 mutation most frequently altered in polycythemia vera and related myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Using a system that incorporates two guide RNAs, the inventors were able to develop a targeting method to limit insertions and deletions in exons of the wild type allele, while the mutant sequence can be specifically targeted for nuclease activity. The mutant gene is then repaired via homologous recombination, with the normal donor template delivered in an AAV6 capsid.\nIn in vitro experiments using human doner hematopoietic stem cells, the gene editing technique produced efficient replacement of the mutant JAK2 allele, with minimal impact on the wild type allele. Edited cells can subsequently be used as a starting material for autologous bone marrow transplant.\nStage of development\nIn vitro proof of concept in patient-derived HSCs, in vivo research ongoing.\n\nApplications: Potentially curative therapeutic for polycythemia vera or other JAK2-mutated MPNs, Ex vivo gene editing strategy for incorporation into stem cell transplantation protocols.\n\nAdvantages: Potential for one-time, curative treatment option.","**Summary:** The invention addresses polycythemia vera, a rare blood cancer caused by a mutation in the JAK2 gene, which leads to excessive production of red blood cells and increased risk of serious cardiovascular events. Current treatments are limited to managing symptoms and lack curative options. Researchers at Stanford's Porteus lab have developed a CRISPR-based gene editing technique targeting the JAK2 mutation specifically in hematopoietic stem cells. This method utilizes two guide RNAs to achieve accurate editing, avoiding alterations to the wild type JAK2 allele essential for normal blood cell production. The targeted mutant allele modification is accomplished through homologous recombination, with a normal donor template introduced via an AAV6 capsid. Initial in vitro results indicate successful replacement of the mutant allele while preserving the wild type allele's function.

**Applications:** The technology could revolutionize the treatment approach for patients with polycythemia vera and related myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) by potentially offering a curative gene editing solution that targets the underlying genetic mutation, allowing for normal hematopoiesis without compromising the essential functions of the wild type JAK2 gene.

**Problem Solved:** The invention addresses the limitations of existing treatments for polycythemia vera, which primarily focus on symptom management rather than correcting the underlying genetic mutation. By utilizing a precise genome editing strategy to deactivate the harmful JAK2 mutation while preserving the normal allele, this approach offers the potential for a long-term cure and improved clinical outcomes for patients suffering from this condition.","Polycythemia vera is a rare blood cancer caused by a mutation in the JAK2 gene, resulting in an overproduction of red blood cells and associated coagulation events.

The expression of tEPOR in the modified cells and their descendants, in particular in the erythropoietic lineage (e.g., red blood cells), leads to enhanced growth and/or proliferation. This enhanced growth and/or proliferation leads to the enrichment of the cells relative to unmodified cells in vitro and/or in vivo. Accordingly, when coupled with a desired trait or an additional genetic modification (e.g., to effect the expression of a therapeutic transgene), the induction of tEPOR expression in the modified cells can be used to enhance the presence of the desired and/or modified cells in vitro or in vivo. Currently, edited cell chimerism is one of the greatest bottlenecks to clinical efficacy of gene therapies for hemoglobin diseases. As a result, transplanted genetically modified HSCs often fail to proliferate or be maintained sufficiently to provide therapeutic benefit.

In the past 50 years, myopia prevalence in the U.S. and Europe has doubled and in China has jumped from 20% to 90% of the population. Slowing myopia progression even minimally can help prevent blindness. Despite the high prevalence, no pharmacologic treatment has been approved or cleared for myopia control by the U.S. FDA. Increasing ocular dopamine has been explored as a treatment; however, use of isolated dopaminergic agents can cause side effects such as nausea and vomiting, as well as conjunctivitis. The Stanford team's novel approach uses a dopaminergic prodrug to avoid negative effects on the eye while still allowing for penetration of medication past the ocular surface. They found that topical administration of the prodrug etilevodopa showed no evidence of retinal toxicity and warrants additional investigation as a potential therapeutic treatment for myopia.\nStage of Development\nPre-clinical.

The hip is a ball and socket joint with the head of the femur (thighbone) serving as the ball. ONH is a painful condition that occurs when blood supply to the ball (femoral head) is disrupted. This condition can lead to collapse of the ball, subsequent arthritis and eventual need for total hip replacement.

Chiral spectroscopy based on differential absorption of circularly polarized light (CPL) is a method that can help separate these closely related molecules, but the effect is generally too weak for efficient separation or sensitive detection. Nanophotonic platforms can enhance the effect by increasing the local density of optical chirality of the circularly polarized light, but metasurfaces that operate in the ultraviolet spectrum are lacking.\nScientists in the Dionne group have developed a high quality factor diamond metasurface that concentrates the local density of optical chirality up to 1130-fold to allow sensitive detection of enantiomeric molecules with CPL and enables efficient separation with a chiral column.

"Stanford University","Blocking and Reversing Extracellular Vesicle-Driven Transcriptomic Transformation with Annexin V Treatment","Docket #: S21-223","Published Application: WO2023130112","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/blocking-and-reversing-extracellular-vesicle-driven-transcriptomic-transformation","Stanford researchers led by Dr. Francis Blankenberg have developed a novel therapeutic concept for blocking and reversing the transcriptomic changes induced by uptake of extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, by administration of Annexin V protein to a tumor microenvironment (TME). EVs continuously shed within the TME contain the cytoplasmic and membrane contents of their parental cells and are rapidly taken up by adjacent cells. It is known that tumor-derived EVs may interfere with immune therapies, and EV cross-talk can influence major tumor-related pathways such as hypoxia-driven epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cancer stemness, angiogenesis, and metastasis involving many cell types within the TME. The Stanford team has shown that infusion of rh-Annexin V (AnxV), a well-described safe human protein with nanomolar affinity for externalized membrane bound phosphatidylserine (PS), can block the uptake of PS+ EVs shed within the TME and inhibit EV-driven pro-tumoral transcriptomic transformation of tumor-associated immune, neo-angiogenic and stromal cells. They further show that irradiated orthotopic 4T1 murine mammary carcinomas transform the TME towards a pro-tumoral, immunosuppressive and neo-angiogenic transcriptome as determined by RNAseq analyses which can be reversed with systemic infusions of AnxV.\nStage of Development\nThe researchers have demonstrated that extracellular AnxV not only can inhibit PS-mediated phagocytosis/efferocytosis and PS receptor signaling pathways as described previously, but can reduce and/or reverse the pro-tumoral transcriptomic changes within the tumor microenvironment one week following a single 20 Gy dose of gamma radiation delivered to orthotopic 4T1 murine mammary carcinomas.\n\nApplications: Inhibition of pro-tumoral transformation of immune, stromal, and vascular cells mediated by EVs/exosomes shed by tumor cells, AnxV treatment may be combined with a second anti-cancer therapy, e.g., radiation therapy, checkpoint inhibitor therapy, chemotherapy, CAR-T cell therapy, administration of anti-tumor antibodies, and targeted cancer therapy.\n\nAdvantages: New high potential therapeutic concept.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford, led by Dr. Francis Blankenberg, have developed a therapeutic approach using Annexin V to mitigate the transcriptomic changes caused by the uptake of extracellular vesicles in the tumor microenvironment. These extracellular vesicles, particularly those derived from tumors, have been shown to significantly influence pathways related to cancer progression, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and immune evasion. By administering recombinant human Annexin V, which binds to externalized phosphatidylserine on the surface of these vesicles, the team found that they could block the uptake of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles, subsequently inhibiting the pro-tumoral transcriptomic changes in various cell types within the tumor microenvironment. The therapy has been shown to reverse the immunosuppressive and neo-angiogenic changes initiated by tumor-derived extracellular vesicles in murine mammary carcinoma models.

**Applications:** This technology could potentially be applied in cancer therapies aimed at improving the effectiveness of immune therapies and reversing the adverse effects of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles in various cancer types. It may also be useful in refining treatments that promote a more favorable tumor microenvironment for patient outcomes.

**Problem Solved:** The development addresses the issue of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles disrupting immune response and promoting cancer progression through alterations in the transcriptomes of surrounding cells in the tumor microenvironment. By preventing the uptake of these vesicles, the approach offers a pathway to inhibit their pro-tumoral effects, thereby enhancing therapeutic strategies against cancer.","Stanford researchers led by Dr. Francis Blankenberg have developed a therapeutic approach using Annexin V protein to block and reverse transcriptomic changes caused by the uptake of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the tumor microenvironment.

Given the technological promise of halide perovskites, this intuitive synthetic route sets a foundation for the directed synthesis of richly structured complex semiconductors that self-assemble in water. The method may be applied to perovskites or more generally to other heterostructures with two different 2D materials. The coupling of two different inorganic lattices can form materials that show a combination of properties (e.g., a magnetic lattice and a conductive lattice can show magnetoresistance). Further, the heterostructure can show new emergent properties not seen in the individual 2D parent structures (e.g., excitons delocalized between both layers).

The effect of ultrasound on excitable biological tissue has been studied since 1920s but the exact mechanisms of the phenomenon are not fully discovered or understood yet. Previous and current approaches using focused, or planar ultrasound transducers inevitably experience attenuation of plane waves in a coupling medium and are bulky and complicated to be coupled with high-resolution imaging/recording techniques.\nWe developed new type of ultrasound neurostimulation device using lamb-wave mode-conversion principle to improve the delivery of ultrasound and reduce the complexity of the in-vitro and ex-vivo experimental setup. The device consists of a piezoelectric cylinder, a 250 µm thick glass coverslip as a specimen stage, and surrounding glass wall. Working in radial mode vibration, the piezoelectric cylinder induces lamb-waves in the glass coverslip and the antisymmetric mode lamb-waves below approximately 1 MHz, which have phase velocities slower than that of the biological solution or water in the specimen stage. These propagate through the glass coverslip, converge at the center, and then leak into the biological specimen.

Surgical management of kidney stone disease includes ureteroscopy, in which a ureteroscope is passed endoscopically up to the stone and a laser fiber is used to fragment/and or dust the stone. While fragmentation and active retrieval of stone fragments achieves higher stone-free rates, it is often associated with a significantly longer operating time as fragments are extracted one by one with a basket. Dusting creates smaller fragments which are left in the kidney and are assumed to pass spontaneously in the urine, however this assumption is not true in all patients.\nComplete stone clearance is desirable, as residual stone fragments can re-obstruct the ureter and are associated with complications such as emergency room visits and repeat surgery. Only 60-75% of ureteroscopic treatments achieve complete stone-free status, and around 30% of patients with even small ( 2 mm) residual fragments experience stone-related complications.\nThe MagSToNE technology provides a solution to improve surgical efficiency and efficacy by quickly removing stone fragments and achieving more complete stone clearance. The invention consists of two components, a small-diameter flexible magnetic wire (MagWIRE) and superparamagnetic particles with surface chemistries that bind to kidney stones. After a kidney stone is fragmented, a superparamagnetic particle solution is instilled through the ureteral access sheath and coats the fragments, rendering them magnetizable. The MagWIRE is able to enter through the ureteroscope or the access sheath and uses a unique magnetic configuration to generate a strong magnetic field to optimize the capture of stone fragment along the entire length of the wire (Figure 1).\nThe MagWIRE can quickly pass in and out multiple times to retrieve multiple fragments with each pass, resulting in the efficient and effective removal of all fragments. This device is designed to work with existing ureteroscopy setups, making it a convenient tool to incorporate into urology practices and presents a great opportunity for companies involved in kidney stone management devices.\nStage of Research\nIn vitro studies were performed with iron oxide particles of a range of sizes (7 nm to 4.5 µm) and kidney stones of a variety of compositions (calcium phosphate (CaPO4), calcium oxalate monohydrate (CaOxM), uric acid, and struvite). Particles ranging from 50 nm to 3 µm in diameter facilitate the magnetic capture of > 90% of calcium phosphate stone fragments 1 mm in diameter (Figure 2). Ferumoxytol, an FDA-approved nanoparticle used intravenously for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia, also performs satisfactorily. Larger 1 µm particles perform more consistently across a range of stone compositions, also achieving > 90% capture of stone fragments 1 mm in size (Figure 3). For stones 1mm, when compared to conventional basket retrieval, the MagSToNE system retrieved > 10-fold more stone and performed 20 times faster (Table 1).\nResearch is ongoing to further optimize the particle surface chemistry, particle delivery, and wire design to facilitate capture of larger stone fragments. Particle biocompatibility and proof of concept studies are planned for porcine models.\nFigure 1:\nFigure 2:\nFigure 3:\nTable:\n\nApplications: Efficiently removes kidney stone fragments using magnetization in stone procedures. Designed for use in ureteroscopy but can also be applied to percutaneous nephrolithomy (PCNL) and cystoscopy for bladder stones..\n\nAdvantages: Maximizes stone free rate while minimizing operative time, Able to remove small fragments that are difficult to retrieve with conventional baskets, MagWIRE has slim profile similar to existing guide wires used for ureteroscopy, MagWIRE has been well-characterized, studied and prototyped in a previous application (see publication), Designed to work with existing ureteroscopy setups, Currently no magnetic stone extraction technologies in commercial use, Can potentially utilize an existing FDA-approved nanoparticle to facilitate clinical translation.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford University have developed a device called MagSToNE that employs magnetization to enhance the removal of kidney stones during ureteroscopy. This technology aims to improve the stone-free rate while reducing the operating time associated with traditional methods. The device consists of a flexible magnetic wire and superparamagnetic particles, which work together to retrieve stone fragments more efficiently than current techniques, which often lead to prolonged surgical duration and incomplete removal of fragments.

**Applications:** The MagSToNE device can be used in medical procedures for the treatment of kidney stones, specifically during ureteroscopy, where it aids in the extraction of both fragmented and intact kidney stones.

**Problem Solved:** The MagSToNE technology addresses the challenges of achieving complete stone clearance during ureteroscopy, which traditionally results in complications related to residual stone fragments.

By categorizing distinct genome-driven subsets of breast cancer, inventors were able to determine the rate, route, and location of tumor metastasis with utmost precision. Currently, doctors rely on the size/grade of the tumor and the degree of lymph node spread but the exact course of the tumor is unknown especially after the patient was considered cured (after 5 yrs post diagnosis). This leaves doctors with no full-proof way to plan careful clinical follow-ups--ultimately missing critical cancer recurrences.\nAfter following over 3000 women diagnosed with breast cancer (between 1977 and 2005), researchers discovered that certain molecular components of tumor tissue could be categorized into specific, distinct tumors which helped to provide a chronology of tumor metastasis.

Foam is the most common form of shock absorption material, but its force exerted is proportional to the degree of displacement. They are also singular in their ideal force profiles making them incapable of adapting to different impact speeds. In applications such as football helmets or automobile safety, this can lead to more damage than the initial impact itself. This design utilizes an incompressible liquid contained within a fabric vessel, which is ejected upon impact as the vessel collapses into an outer elastic refill chamber.

Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness world-wide, affecting millions of adults in the United States alone. The disease is characterized by the degeneration and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), a type of neuron that functions in transmitting visual signals from the retina to the optic nerve. Glaucoma is also characterized by functional changes in the astrocytes of the retina and optic nerve head (ONH), which function to support and protect RGCs. Current eyedrop treatments for glaucoma are aimed at reducing elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and slowing progression of the disease. Unfortunately, these treatments lose effectiveness at the later stages of the disease and fail to directly target the role retinal and ONH astrocytes play in glaucoma progression. This new methodology allows for highly specific targeting of viral vector gene therapies to retinal and ONH astrocytes, facilitating novel and desperately needed modalities for the treatment of glaucoma and other optic neuropathies.\n\nApplications: Targeted gene therapy delivery to retinal/optic nerve head astrocytes, Glaucoma, Optic neuropathies.\n\nAdvantages: No existing gene therapies for glaucoma and other optic neuropathies, No existing methods for targeting gene therapy to retinal/optic nerve head astrocytes.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford have developed a method for delivering gene therapy specifically to retinal astrocytes, which may provide a new approach for treating glaucoma and other optic neuropathies.

With a market cap of $3.2 billion, antifoams (or defoamers) are additives used across industries to control deleterious foaming in liquids such as lubricants and diesel fuels. Usually, antifoams take the form of dispersed particles or immiscible droplets, which are difficult to incorporate and susceptible to separation from the liquid during operation. Once the antifoams separate from the liquid they are effectively useless, leading to unwanted foaming. Unlike existing products, which break up foams through either spreading or bridging-dewetting mechanisms, the new antifoams use a different physical mechanism - species concentration-induced surface tension gradients (also called Marangoni flows). This different physical mechanism makes fully miscible antifoams possible. When mixed into a target liquid, the miscible antifoam, through its relatively higher volatility, leads to surface tension gradients that cause bubble rupture up to 10 times faster than the target liquid without the antifoam.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept.

Normal and healthy cells display the cell-surface protein CD47 that serves as a 'don't eat me' signal through interaction with signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) receptors on phagocytes of the immune system. This signaling is a key component to the specificity of the immune system's clearance of aged, damaged, and dying cells. Pathogens across the tree of life have evolved proteins that mimic CD47 to similarly suppress phagocytes from consuming them, enhancing their ability to establish persistent infections. Characterizing potential CD47 mimics in diverse pathogens remains a challenge as they can often not be identified through sequence-similarity searches. This engineered protein can not only block the function of pathogen CD47 mimics to reduce infections and improve protective innate immune responses, but also be employed as a probe for the discovery of unknown CD47 mimics.\n\nApplications: Infectious diseases, Bacterial Infection, Lyme Disease, Fungal Infection, Aspergillosis, CD47 mimic target discovery.\n\nAdvantages: No current therapeutics that target pathogen CD47 mimics, High specificity, High affinity, Unknown pathogen CD47 mimic discovery tool.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford's Weissman lab have developed an engineered protein that effectively blocks the action of CD47 mimics employed by various pathogens to avoid detection and destruction by the immune system.

However, pathogens have evolved to express proteins that mimic CD47, allowing them to evade the immune system and persist within the host. This new protein not only mitigates the immunosuppressive effects of pathogen CD47 mimics but also serves as a valuable tool for identifying unknown CD47 mimics in different pathogens.

Sometimes the cell product is no longer detectable in the peripheral blood, due to potential exhaustion or lack of engraftment. Additionally, most T cells become exhausted when they cannot properly differentiate into effector memory T cells, thereby disrupting their persistence in the body. Current approaches to address this issue have been limited, as they rely on restarting from different T cell progenitors instead of trying to manipulate the underlying molecular pathways that are involved in T cell memory.\nInventors at Stanford have developed a method to show how modulating certain transcription factors can improve adaptive immunity. They demonstrated that memory T cells highly express the BHLHE40 transcription factor and modulating the expression of BHLHE40 can lead to the development of novel cancer immunotherapies. Through modulation of BHLHE40 transcription factor, the Roncarolo Lab was able to decrease the frequency of T cells becoming exhausted. BHLHE40 is required for efficient expression of cytokines including: IFNg, IL4, and IL-2. Knocking out BHLHE40 in human naive CD4+ T cells leads to an increase in IL-10 production but does not have a significant effect in IL10 production when knocked out in total CD4+ T cells.\nBy inhibiting a transcription factor (e.g. through genetic manipulation), the invention can be used to prevent the differentiation of a subset of cells and skew the differentiation into another subset of cells. By identifying the transcription factors involved in the differentiation, cells can more easily differentiate in vitro and in vivo and be leveraged for the development of novel immunotherapies.\n\nApplications: Cell manufacturing by upregulating transcription factors during the production of CAR-T cells or in vivo post infusion., Cell control and targeting, Immunotherapy and CAR-T cell therapy.\n\nAdvantages: Targets underlying molecular pathways involved in T-cell memory instead of T-cell progenitors, Reduces cell manufacturing time, Increases Tr1 cell yield.","**Summary:** The technology centers around the modulation of the BHLHE40 transcription factor to improve the differentiation of type 1 regulatory T cells and reduce T cell exhaustion. Exhausted T cells, which lose functionality over time, contribute to the ineffectiveness of T cell-targeted immunotherapies. The inventors at Stanford demonstrated that enhancing the expression of BHLHE40 in memory T cells can bolster adaptive immunity and reduce T cell exhaustion, thereby facilitating the development of new cancer immunotherapies. Specifically, BHLHE40 is crucial for the expression of key cytokines like IFNg, IL4, and IL-2. While knocking out BHLHE40 in naive human CD4+ T cells increases IL-10 production, this effect is not observed when BHLHE40 is knocked out in total CD4+ T cells.

**Applications:** The modulation of BHLHE40 may allow for the development of innovative cancer immunotherapies aimed at enhancing T cell functionality and persistence, potentially improving outcomes in cancer treatment. This approach can also be applied in various immunological disorders where T cell exhaustion is a concern.

**Problem Solved:** The technology addresses the issue of T cell exhaustion, which hampers the effectiveness of immunotherapies by disrupting the differentiation and persistence of T cells in the body. By targeting the molecular pathways associated with T cell memory and exhaustion, the method provides a novel solution to enhance the efficacy of immune responses.","Exhausted T cells become dysfunctional over time, contributing to reduced effectiveness of T cell-targeted immunotherapies and possibly becoming undetectable in the peripheral blood.

The application of CAR-T cell anti-cancer therapy for treatment of hematologic cancers have been successful, however the tumor microenvironment (TME) surrounding solid tumors exhibit an immunosuppressive effect that directly inhibits CAR-T cell function. An important component of the immunosuppressive TME is phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization causing anti-tumor immunity including arrest of T-cell signaling within cytotoxic CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. This essentially blocks immune signaling and inactivates CAR-T CD8+ lymphocytes. Stanford researchers have found that exogenous administration of annexin V, which binds to PS with high affinity, masks the highly immunosuppressive effects of externalized PS found in the TME. Furthermore, the combination of tumor specific CAR-T cell therapy with continuous administration of annexin V over several weeks' reverses tumor induced CAR-T cell exhaustion, a novel invention that has the potential to make CAR-T therapy a viable treatment for solid tumors.\n\nApplications: Administration of combination CAR-T cell therapy with annexin V for the treatment of solid tumors, Continuous systemic or local infusion of annexin V at doses of 2 to 2.5 mg/kg/day for 2 to 4 weeks based on animal model work is well tolerated.\n\nAdvantages: Annexin V is a human protein with nanomolar affinity for PS, CAR-T cell therapy has been ineffective in treating solid tumors, combination therapy with annexin V could make it a viable treatment option.","**Summary:** Researchers at Stanford University have developed a method to reverse tumor-induced exhaustion of CAR-T cells and CD8+ T cells by administering annexin V. This approach addresses the challenges posed by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS), which impedes T-cell signaling and inhibits CAR-T cell function. By using annexin V, which binds to PS with high affinity, the detrimental effects of PS in the TME can be masked. Combining tumor-specific CAR-T cell therapy with ongoing administration of annexin V over several weeks has been shown to reverse CAR-T cell exhaustion, suggesting a promising avenue for enhancing CAR-T therapy's efficacy against solid tumors.

Imitation learning is an AI process of learning by observing an expert, and has been recognized as a powerful approach for sequential decision-making, with diverse applications like healthcare, autonomous driving and complex game playing. However, conventional imitation learning methodologies often utilize behavioral cloning, which has advantages of simplicity and stability, but fails to recognize any information involving an environment's dynamics. Conventional methods that do exploit dynamics information tend to be difficult to train in practice due to an adversarial optimization process over reward and policy approximators.

However, the repaired area after the graft exhibits fibrotic healing, which results in fragility, lack of flexibility, and scar contracture. Groups at Stanford and elsewhere have demonstrated that mechanotransduction pathways are involved in scarring and fibrosis and that Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) proteins are key signaling components in these pathways.\nIn this work, Stanford scientists test the principle that FAK inhibition is an effective strategy for reducing wound scarring and fibrosis using a previously validated and selective FAK inhibitor called VS-6062. They combine split thickness skin grafting with the application of collagen-pullulan hydrogels containing this FAK inhibitor and show in a porcine model that the addition of the inhibitor-containing hydrogel accelerates wound healing, reduces scarring, and blocks scar contracture as compared to hydrogels alone. The promising results of this straightforward method in a large animal model indicate a technology that is ripe for clinical trials and commercialization.\n\nApplications: Scar reduction, improved wound healing, and reduced wound contracture after skin graft repair of burn wounds or related soft-tissue defects.\n\nAdvantages: Improved function: Less wound contracture and greater flexibility of the skin around joints improves movement as compared to the standard-of-care skin graft alone, Improved appearance: Less scarring than with grafting alone leads to improved aesthetic result for patients, increasing their quality of life, IND-stage therapy: Promising results in porcine models and an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA in preparation indicate an advanced therapeutic product ready to move into patients soon.","**Summary:** Stanford inventors have discovered that applying a hydrogel containing an inhibitor of mechanotransduction pathways enhances healing and reduces scarring after the repair of traumatic injuries, such as severe burn wounds, when used in combination with split thickness skin grafting (STSG).

"Stanford University","Perfect color routers for solid state image sensors","Docket #: S20-402","Published Application: WO2022094453, Published Application: 20230417960","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/perfect-color-routers-solid-state-image-sensors","Image sensors are used across the board in high-resolution image sensing technologies, and critically rely on their ability to separate colors of light. Current commercial standards utilize color filters, which absorb unwanted wavelengths to filter and transmit only the desired color to the photodetector of the corresponding color channel, , e.g., red (R), green (G), blue (B). Although effective, this design is very inefficient and captures only a small fraction of light at the detector (less than 20-25% for a color filter array with a typical 2 by 2 pixel RGGB Bayer kernel), which makes low light imaging challenging and limits the practical size of image sensor pixels. The Fan group has designed a color router based on lossless materials that cleanly routes all incident light based on its spectral content (colors) with perfect (~ 100%) photon efficiency to the proper photodetector for all color channels. This results in a 4-5 times increase in the number of photons at the pixel photodetector level compared to a color filter-based approach. This color router design allows further scaling of image sensor pixels to sub-wavelength sizes ( 400 nm) since no light is reflected or absorbed. The underlying design principles can be applied to any desired wavelength of light and dielectric materials, allowing this technology to push the performance and size in color-separating devices to the absolute limit.\nPhoto description: a) Diagram of a typical color filter (CF) setup (ML = microlens) and b) diagram of a color router setup.

Unlike traditional color filters that absorb unwanted wavelengths and allow less than 20-25% light transmission, this new approach captures nearly 100% of incoming light.

"Stanford University","Deep Learning for In Vivo Near-Infrared Imaging","Docket #: S20-378","Issued: 12039723 (USA)","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/deep-learning-vivo-near-infrared-imaging","Near-infrared (NIR) imaging is a valuable research tool that produces quality images with high spatial and temporal resolution through millimeter tissue depths. Imaging at the NIR-IIb window (1500 – 1700 nm) is the most effective one-photon approach to suppressing light scattering and maximizing imaging penetration depth. Unfortunately, toxic nanoparticle probes must be used to capture images in the NIR-IIb window. Biocompatible fluorescent probes can be used at a lower wavelength at NIR-I (700 – 1000 nm) or NIR-IIa (1000-1300 nm); however, light scattering occurs at shorter wavelengths and results in suboptimal imaging. Inventors in the Dai lab at Stanford trained artificial neural networks to transform a fluorescence image in the shorter wavelength NIR window of 900-1300 nm to a high-resolution image resembling a NIR-IIb image. With deep-learning translation, in vivo lymph node imaging achieved unprecedented signal-to-background ratio, while enhancing tumor-to-normal tissue ratio to improve tumor margin localization. The deep learning software also improved image clarity and in vivo non-invasive NIR-II resolution. The invention is compatible with any fluorescence imaging system and a wide range of NIR fluorophores. NIR imaging equipped with deep learning could prove to be a valuable tool to facilitate basic biomedical research and empower clinical diagnostics and imaging-guided surgery in the clinic.\n\nApplications: -Tumor imaging, -image-guided therapy, -Fluorescence microscopy.\n\nAdvantages: -Compatible with any NIR fluorophores and targeting ligands, -Generalizable to other fluorescence imaging systems, -Does not require prior information input for imaging processing.","**Summary:** Near-infrared imaging is a powerful tool that captures high-quality images through millimeter tissue depths, particularly in the NIR-IIb window which offers superior penetration and reduced light scattering. While toxic nanoparticle probes are typically required for imaging within this range, biocompatible probes can only be employed at lower wavelengths, resulting in less optimal imaging due to light scattering. Researchers at Stanford developed artificial neural networks that can convert fluorescence images from the 900-1300 nm NIR window into high-resolution images that mimic NIR-IIb images. This deep learning approach has significantly improved the signal-to-background ratios in in vivo lymph node imaging and enhanced the tumor-to-normal tissue ratio for better tumor margin identification. Furthermore, it enhances image clarity and allows for non-invasive imaging in the NIR-II resolution range. The technology is compatible with various fluorescence imaging systems and fluorophores, thereby offering diverse applications in medical research and clinical practice.

**Applications:** The technology has potential applications in tumor imaging, image-guided therapy, and fluorescence microscopy, contributing significantly to basic biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. 

**Problem Solved:** The innovation addresses the limitations associated with traditional NIR imaging techniques, such as the reliance on toxic nanoparticle probes and suboptimal imaging at shorter wavelengths, by providing a non-toxic, high-resolution imaging solution that enhances clarity and accuracy in biomedical applications.","Near-infrared imaging is a valuable research tool that achieves high-quality images through millimeter tissue depths, particularly effective in the NIR-IIb window (1500 – 1700 nm) for minimizing light scattering.

"Stanford University","Local Autonomy-Based Haptic Robot Interaction with Dual Proxy Model for Remote Operation","Docket #: S20-460","","https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/local-autonomy-based-haptic-robot-interaction-dual-proxy-model-remote-operation","Remotely operated robotic devices are becoming increasingly important in fields such as medicine, space and field research. However, their widespread application is hampered by distance between the robot and its operator which results in communication delays. To address this issue, Stanford researchers have developed a system to perform remote haptic control of robots even in the presence of large communication delays. While existing systems quickly become dangerous and unstable when delays reach ~100 milliseconds, this approach that leverages robot local autonomy is robust to delays longer than 1 second. The method consists in separating the control between the operator and robot into three components. Two local controllers on the operator and robot side that maintain a degree of autonomy, and a dual-proxy model that connects them and acts as a smart communication bridge by generating safe and consistent inputs to the local controllers. Finally, a perception algorithm allows the robot to detect its environment geometry in real time. This informs the parameters set in the dual proxy model to enable fully autonomous implementation of the system. This system is applicable to any remote robotic operation regardless of distance and communication delay.\nPhoto description: Dual proxy model for local autonomy-based haptic interaction.
