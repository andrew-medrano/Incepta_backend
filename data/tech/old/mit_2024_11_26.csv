MIT,"Drinkable, Tough Hydrogels for GastrointestinalApplications",Case number: #24642JQ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/drinkable-tough-hydrogels-gastrointestinal,"This technology is a method for oral drug delivery involving the administration of pharmaceutically acceptable fluids to a patient in drinkable form. These fluids then partially or fully solidify within 15’ in the stomach to form a slow or sustained drug release article. This drinkable formulation allows for easier oral administration of drugs in a liquid format which transitions to a solid state within the stomach while encapsulating the active agent(s), optimizing drug release over time while providing protection against the harsh environment of the stomach.\n\nTechnology: This method can utilize either one or two compositions. If a singular composition is used, it is formulated to thicken and solidify when exposed to pH conditions in the gastrointestinal tract. In the case of two separate compositions, the first fluid contains crosslinkers, and the second fluid contains hydrogel precursors and pharmaceutical agent. When these fluids are mixed within the stomach, they polymerize to form a double network hydrogel. The patient drinks the first fluid followed by the second, allowing the mixture to harden to form an excipient containing the active pharmaceutical agent(s). The compositions and methods were enabled with crosslinked alginate and four-arm PEG-maleimide hydrogels for sustained releases of both viable enzymes and probiotic bacteria in vivo using large animal model systems (porcine). The biocompatible devices remained within the stomach for up to 24 hours prior to dissolution.\n\nProblem Addressed: Oral drug delivery (e.g., pills, gel tabs, or capsules) can be difficult, unpleasant, or impossible for many patients, particularly older and younger ones. While liquid formulations are easier to ingest, they are susceptible to rapid dilution and/or degradation within the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract and may not provide ideal release profiles or localization of therapeutics. This technology offers a drinkable drug formulation capable of changing into a solid after swallowing.\n\nAdvantages: Drinkable formula allows for easy drug administration. Capable of transitioning from liquid to solid within the stomach. Solid state protects the drug against the harsh gastric environment. Longer gastric retention, allows for co-encapsulation, and improves control of API release kinetics"

It operates by introducing specific mutations within the DNA binding cleft of the Cas nuclease, which decreases, inhibits, or prevents non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and related indel-producing pathways. At the same time, it enhances homology-driven repair pathways, such as homology-directed repair (HDR) and microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ). This advancement enables more accurate and predictable genome edits compared to existing CRISPR-Cas systems.\n\nTechnology: The engineered Cas nuclease (vCas9) is introduced into cells, where it decreases, inhibits, or prevents indel-producing DNA repair pathways, such as NHEJ, and enhances precise editing pathways like HDR and MMEJ. This shift is driven by specific mutations within the DNA binding cleft of the Cas nuclease. The technology is versatile, functioning in both dividing and non-dividing cells, making it suitable for a wide range of genome editing applications.\n\nProblem Addressed: This technology addresses the limitations of traditional CRISPR-Cas systems, which frequently result in unpredictable and imprecise genome edits due to the common occurrence of indel mutations through pathways like NHEJ. These indels can lead to unintended genetic modifications, complicating the editing process. By decreasing, inhibiting, or preventing NHEJ and promoting HDR and MMEJ, this technology enables more precise and reliable genome edits.\n\nAdvantages: The engineered Cas nucleases reduce NHEJ while increasing HDR and MMEJ, leading to more precise genome editing.. These nucleases are effective in both dividing and non-dividing cells, broadening their applicability..

MIT,Backbone Cleavable Polymethacrylates Via Optimized ThionolactoneComonoemers,Case number: #25292,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/backbone-cleavable-polymethacrylates-optimized,"This technology comprises a chemical formula for thionolactones, which may be useful as comonomers for copolymerization. Thionolactone-based polymethacrylates represent a novel class of polymers that incorporate cleavable thioester groups into their backbone, enabling their degradation into smaller fragments. Utilizing radical ring-opening polymerization (rROP), these polymers are synthesized by copolymerizing thionolactones with methacrylates, resulting in degradable random copolymers. This technology marks a significant advancement in sustainable materials, offering an eco-friendly alternative to traditional non-degradable polymers.\n\nTechnology: The synthesis of backbone cleavable polymethacrylates begins with thionolactones—comonomers that can copolymerize with methacrylates to produce random copolymers. By employing rROP, cleavable thioester groups are randomly integrated into polymer backbones. The resulting polymers are backbone-degradable, allowing them to be broken down under specific conditions for recycling, upcycling, or biodegradation schemes.\n\nProblem Addressed: This technology addresses the need for degradable polymethacrylates by incorporating cleavable thionolactones into polymer backbones. Previously, the development of such materials has faced challenges due to the reaction kinetics of methacrylate polymerization, making it difficult for cleavable comonomers to be inserted into the polymer backbone randomly. The disclosed technology presents optimized thionolactone comonomers capable of forming eco-friendly, degradable polymethacrylates.\n\nAdvantages: Enables the creation of polymers with cleavable thioester groups in their backbones, thereby allowing for degradation into small fragments suitable for recycling or biodegradation. Offers a new approach to polymer design by utilizing thionolactones as comonomers, which have not been previously used to make poly(methacrylates).

MIT,Liquid Exchange and Positioning of Cellular Entities in a Liquid-airInterface,Case number: #24928J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/liquid-exchange-and-positioning-cellular-entities,"This technology is a hanging drop-based microfluidic system, device, and method for liquid exchange in the vitrification of an egg or embryo. The method involves forming a hanging drop chamber, receiving the specimen into the chamber, and loading various liquids into the plurality of microfluidic channels to facilitate a controlled liquid exchange surrounding the cell prior to freezing. By automating the delicate process of cryoprotectant loading and specimen retrieval, this technology ensures low-cost, scalable, and consistent outcomes.\n\nTechnology: An egg or embryo is first loaded into the disposable chamber (or hanging drop). From there, it sinks due to gravity and migrates towards the liquid-air interface of the chamber, which has an opening connected to the microfluidic channel in the housing. Once in the housing, the liquid exchange process commences by flowing different liquids (e.g., cryoprotectants) through the inlet and microfluidic channel and out through outlet. Once the specimen has been retrieved from the chamber via a vitrification carrier (such as a cryoloop which can be connected to a robotic arm), it is rapidly moved into a vitrification medium, such as liquid nitrogen, to complete the freezing process for long term storage.\n\nProblem Addressed: The absence of an automated method for egg or embryo freezing has caused the egg vitrification market to have high costs, low scalability, and high variability in clinical outcomes. Egg freezing’s technical and sensitive nature necessitates highly trained embryologists, which are in limited supply. However, even with skilled embryologists, damage to eggs can still occur during several critical steps of vitrification, namely loading of the cryoprotectant, timing of the processes, and using too much liquid during freezing. An automated device operated by an entry-level embryologist could ensure consistent clinical outcomes comparable to top-tier experts and enable scalability. By significantly reducing the level of technical skill and clinical infrastructure needed to perform reliable egg freezing, this invention can simultaneously improve the quality of cryopreservation, lower costs, increase the number of viable cells upon thawing, and enable expanded access for patients.\n\nAdvantages: Reduces the level of technical skill and clinical infrastructure needed for egg or embryo freezing. Provides a fully automated and self-contained system for vitrification. Can be fully operated by entry-level technicians. Decreased likelihood of damaging eggs. Improved reliability and quality of cryopreservation"
MIT,Targeted Trans-splicing Using CRISPR-CasSystems,Case number: #20505ER,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/targeted-trans-splicing-using-crispr-cas-systems,"This technology provides a novel method of targeting ribonucleic acids for trans-splicing using any CRISPR/Cas13 orthologs having two Higher Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes Nucleotide-binding (HEPN) endonuclease domains (Type VI CRISPR effectors). The method uses the principles of endogenous RNA processing and RNA-writing using a CRISPR/Cas13 protein to initiate the targeted trans-splicing of defective pre-mRNAs, effectively correcting mutations at the pre-translation level in the nucleus and allowing for the treatment of essentially all types of mongenic diseases. The system is a significant improvement over CRISPR-mediated genomic DNA editing and other gene therapies as it allows for the option of transient RNA repair while improving both the specificity and the efficiency of trans-splicing events.\n\nTechnology: The CRISPR/Cas13 system (a complex of the nuclease-inactive Cas13, guide RNA, and a repair splice donor/acceptor template), specifically recognizes target sequences on the defective pre-mRNA. The system then mediates the process of trans-splicing, utilizing the repair template to join exons within the pre-mRNA or replace targeted exons. This precise modification ensures the desired edits within the repair template are incorporated into the final mRNA. As a result, a modified RNA molecule is produced, which can encode the corrected protein, a novel protein or serve as therapeutic noncoding or regulatory RNA.\n\nProblem Addressed: This technology addresses the limitations of traditional RNA splicing methods by improving the efficiency and specificity of trans-splicing. It offers a mechanism to precisely repair RNA, increasing protein diversity without altering the genomic DNA. Additionally, it can be exploited for molecular therapy to correct mutated gene products and treat a wide range of diseases.\n\nAdvantages: The use of Cas13 and guide RNA allows for precise manipulation of RNA transcripts. Enables exon swapping at 5’/3’ ends and internally, in dividing and post-mitotic cells. Trans-splicing at the pre-mRNA level does not cause changes to genomic DNA. Potential for one off-the-shelf therapeutic formulation to be able to correct multiple different disease-causing mutations in a gene across a patient population"

MIT,Hardware Synthesis from MulticycleRules,Case number: #13362,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/hardware-synthesis-multicycle-rules,"Enabling scheduling of single cycle as well as scheduling multi-cycle rules in a synchronous digital system whose behavior is governed by an asynchronous system specification (e.g., a TRS) provides a way to allow complex actions at state transitions of the asynchronous system without requiring that the complex actions be synthesized in logic that must be performed in a single clock cycle. For example, a relatively infrequent action may include a critical timing path that determines the maximum clock frequency of the system. By allowing that infrequent action to take multiple clock cycles, even if that action takes more absolute time, other actions may take less absolute time by virtue of being able to operate the synchronous system at a higher clock rate.

This method improves upon existing technologies by providing a more efficient and potentially more cost-effective solution for CO2 capture and storage systems.\n\nTechnology: The manufacturing process begins with creating surfactant-coated MgO nanoclusters in a non-aqueous solvent. Subsequently, the clusters are coated with alkali-metal salts through a series of solution dispersions and evaporations, thereby enhancing their CO2 adsorption capacity. When exposed to a gas stream containing CO2, the coated nanoclusters adsorb the CO2, effectively removing it from the stream through rapid uptake of large amounts at moderate temperatures.\n\nProblem Addressed: This invention addresses the urgent need to reduce CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion to mitigate climate change. Coal-fired power plants and mobile sources are major contributors to CO2 emissions, making effective post-combustion carbon capture technologies essential. Current methods for CO2 capture can be energy-intensive and costly. This technology offers a more efficient and potentially cheaper alternative, facilitating easier implementation on a large scale or retrofitting into existing CO2-emitting technologies or plants, including mobile sources such as vehicles, trains and ships.\n\nAdvantages: Lower energy requirements compared to traditional CO2 capture methods.

MIT,Electromagnetic Wave Broadband AngularSelectivity,Case number: #16896,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/electromagnetic-wave-broadband-angular-selectivity,"An angularly dependent material-system can be used in solar energy conversion, privacy protection, and high signal-to-noise detectors.\n\nTechnology: The material-system is achieved through two separate approaches.  Both operate under the following principles: all dielectrics have a Brewster Angle, angle of incidence at which light is completely transmitted, and the location of the bandgap scales proportionally to the periodicity of the quarter-wave stack (i.e. the bandgap can be controlled by stacking layers of quarter-wavelength thickness). Therefore, the effective bandgap can be enlarged by stacking quarter-wave stacks with various periodicities together and if all of these layers have the same Brewster Angle then the entire stack will theoretically transmit all frequencies of light incident at a particular angle. The first approach is photonic crystals that consist of only isotropic materials. This approach consists of 84 layers of Silicon dioxide (SiO2) and Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) fabricated with Bias Target Deposition (BTD) technique and fused on a silica wafer. The sample is transparent to p-polarized incident light at the angular window of transparency (55o±8o), and behaves like a mirror at all other incident angles over the entire visible spectrum. For s-polarized, light the sample behaves like a mirror at all angles, but this can be overcome with a mirror and polarization """"flipper"""". In the first approach, the Brewster angle is limited to angles >45o and is not very tunable. This is overcome in the second approach which consists of isotropic and anisotropic layers, which can be made out of polymers (PET and PMMA) or metamaterials (Rogers R3010 panel and polypropylene). The second approach used only 12 periods of layers to demonstrate the concept. This angularly selective system can change the form of waves from a point source to plane waves and increase the resolution of systems like GPS and Radar that currently rely on interactive wave propogation. This method can also be implemented for systems that have Brewster angle analogs, such as acoustic and elastic waves.\n\nProblem Addressed: In currently known angularly selective systems, the transmission of light depends on the light frequency. This material-system decouples the frequency and the viewing angle, so that there is transparency throughout the visible spectrum at one angle and reflection at every other angle.\n\nAdvantages: Ability to transmit light independent of frequency for one incident angle.

The electrons in this model flow in the opposite direction of a typical OPV. Inverted bilayer OPVs were constructed with layers in the following order from bottom to top: 1) glass, 2) ITO bottom cathode, 3) low work function  PEDOT cathode buffer layer treated with TDAE or Cs2CO3, 4) C60 electron acceptor (40 nm thick), 5) tetraphenyldibenzylperiflanthene (DBP) electron donor (30 nm thick), 6) MoO3 anode buffer layer, and 7) Ag top anode.  Work function measurements showed that TDAE treatment decreased the work function of PEDOT:PSS by 0.6 eV and the work function of CVD PEDOT by 0.8 eV. Cs2CO3 treatment decreased the work functions of both types of PEDOT by 0.3 eV. These low work function PEDOT layers increased the open-circuit voltage (Voc) to 0.9 V, which is comparable to conventional OPVs. In future iterations of this design, current flow through the cell could be could be increased by blending the electron acceptor and electron donor in the center of the structure into a bulk heterojunction or by choosing different materials for the electron acceptor and donor layers (layers 4 and 5).\n\nProblem Addressed: OPVs with a conventional structural orientation are illuminated at the bottom through a transparent anode, such as indium tin oxide (ITO), and electrons are collected on a low work function metal cathode on top. Inverted OPVs use ITO as cathode material and low work function metal substances as anode material instead. Inverted OPVs have several benefits: they may 1) provide more degrees of freedom in designing OPV fabrication schemes, 2) allow for protection of the delicate organic semiconductor layers below the anodic buffer layers, and 3) be more stable by allowing use of higher work function metal top contacts. However, ITO has a high work function and makes a poor cathodes by itself. In order to increase the efficiency of an inverted OPV, a low work function (LWF) cathode buffer layer must be developed to provide a sufficient electric field throughout the device.\n\nAdvantages: More flexibility in the design of OPV fabrication schemes.

MIT,Multi-Stage Membrane DistillationProcess,Case number: #15901,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/multi-stage-membrane-distillation-process,"This multi-stage vacuum membrane distillation technology has applications in small-scale or off-grid desalination, where it delivers performance and efficiency comparable to existing large-scale systems at lower capital cost.\n\nTechnology: This invention overcomes the tradeoff between throughput and thermal efficiency inherent in single-stage VMD systems by cascading multiple VMD modules each operating at progressively lower pressures. At each stage, heated feed water is vaporized and driven through a gas-permeable membrane by a vacuum drawn on the vapor side of the membrane. The hot product water is passed through a condenser and a permeate cooler where energy is transferred to cold incoming feed water. Liquid feed water remaining in the first vaporization vessel is then transferred to the next stage where further vaporization is induced by the lower vapor-side pressure and the process is repeated. Systems can be built with arbitrary numbers of stages, with more numerous stages associated with better thermal efficiency and increased equipment cost.This multi-stage VMD system achieves high throughput since each module produces desalinated water in parallel. Additionally, thermal efficiency is improved by vaporizing as much water as possible at early, low-vacuum, stages before proceeding to later, high-vacuum stages. This allows more heat to be recovered as incoming feed water absorbs energy from progressively hotter product water as its own temperature rises.\n\nProblem Addressed: In vacuum membrane distillation (VMD), a saline liquid stream is vaporized and driven across a hydrophobic porous membrane by lowering the pressure on the vapor side of the membrane. The desalinated vapor is condensed and cooled to recover the latent heat of vaporization. VMD systems are attractive because their relatively low operating temperatures and pressures result in lower capital cost. However, existing VMD systems suffer from poor thermal efficiency (Gained Output Ratio, GOR<1) as drawing a higher vacuum on the vapor side of the membrane to increase throughput results in a lower condensation temperature and lower energy recovery effectiveness. Multi-stage flash (MSF) desalination systems offer superior thermal efficiency (3The novel desalination cycle described in this invention addresses these problems by achieving throughput and thermal efficiency comparable to MSF systems while retaining the capital cost advantage of VMD systems.\n\nAdvantages: Requires smaller, lower-pressure, and cheaper containment vessels compared to MSF systems. Amenable to scaling down for low volume operations. Compatible with low-temperature heat sources such as unconcentrated solar energy. Lower operating temperatures reduce risk of fouling on membrane and heat exchanger surfaces"
MIT,CD80 is a Biomarker of p53 Activity and a Target for CancerTherapy,Case number: #15386H,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/cd80-biomarker-p53-activity-and-target-cancer-therapy,"This technology is a novel method for the characterization of p53 activity in tumorigenic cells using the cell surface expression of CD80 as a biomarker for in vitro and in vivo studies.\n\nTechnology: This invention is based on the discovery that genetic restoration of p53 activity effectively cleared tumorigenic cells in a mouse model of human adenocarcinoma. Tumor cell destruction is orchestrated by the immune system’s natural killer cells (NK), which upregulate the expression of the cell surface marker, CD80, in response to p53 activation. This invention uses anti-CD80 antibodies to monitor the status of p53 activity when DNA damage response or other cellular stress related mechanisms are activated.Cell surface expression of CD80 in response to p53 action is of potential clinical relevance. For instance, the induction of CD80 upon p53 action makes CD80 a useful biomarker for chemotherapeutic success. In addition, cell surface localization of CD80 allows antibody-mediated therapies to specifically target cancer cells with an activated p53 program.\n\nProblem Addressed: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide - specifically, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), representing 85% of lung cancer cases. Lung adenocarcinoma, a histologic class of NSCLC, is associated with recurrent mutations in several well-defined oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, such as p53. As a tumor suppressor, p53 plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation, and it is involved in apoptosis, genomic stability, and inhibition of angiogenesis. For instance, p53 is known to be involved in DNA repair, maintaining growth arrest, and ultimately inducing apoptosis if the cell is damaged. In humans, p53 is encoded by the TP53 gene.  Exposure to chemicals, radiation, or viruses increases TP53’s probability of becoming mutant. These mutations are significant because over 50 percent of human tumors are associated with a mutation or deletion of the TP53 gene.\n\nAdvantages: anti-CD80 antibodies make tumor cells a specific target. CD80 expression useful for monitoring exposure to DNA damage agents or other cellular stresses.. CD80 in response to p53 acivation is of potential clinical relevance. CD80 is expressed on the cell surface after p53 activation"

When carbon fiber is heated above a certain threshold temperature, it experiences a significant loss of both tensile strength and stiffness. The Inventors have demonstrated that tensioning the fibers to approximately 12% of mean breaking strength during the heating process results in the preservation of both stiffness and strength.\n\nProblem Addressed: Carbon fiber is often used in conjunction with resins to create composite materials with excellent tensile stiffness and strength in the plane of the reinforcing fiber plies. It has been suggested that circumferentially coating carbon fibers with arrays of aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) could enable through-thickness and interply reinforcement of carbon fiber-reinforced composites, thereby improving their mechanical properties along other directions. However, conventional methods of growing CNTs significantly degrade the tensile strength and stiffness of carbon fibers used as the substrate.

MIT,Normalization Correction for Inter-Detector Scatter Enhanced Positron EmissionTomography,Case number: #16136,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/normalization-correction-inter-detector-scatter,"This technology is a correction calculation that uses inter-detector scatter (IDS) events collected by a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner to improve PET image quality. This calculation increases the system’s sensitivity and can be used for preclinical and clinical applications, such as the detection of solid tumors.\n\nTechnology: This technology is a strategy for normalization correction for IDS events that have been sorted by any method. The correction, determined during a calibration step, can then be applied to the coincidence data set for PET scans.In calibration, a radiation source is uniformly exposed to all detector pairs in a PET scanner. Double coincidences and IDS coincidences are acquired until enough measurements have been collected to achieve statistical significance in both data sets. IDS events are then sorted and represented, for example, in an LOR histogram. The number of IDS events sorted to a particular LOR is then divided by the average number of IDS events for all of the LORs in the scanner to calculate IDS normalization values for each LOR. In contrast to other normalization methods, which only generate normalization value for double coincidences, this method provides a second set of normalization values for IDS events. During the PET scan, sets of double coincidences and IDS coincidences are collected and stored as separate LOR histogram. The corresponding normalization (from calibration) will be applied independently to each data set. After correction, the data sets are added together to provide normalized information for accurate image reconstruction.\n\nProblem Addressed: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans are frequently used in the early detection of solid tumors, as well as for evaluating heart disease and multiple neurological disorders. In PET, the patient is administered a radioactive tracer that accumulates in metabolically active tissues, such as tumors. The radioactive tracer emits photons which are detected by the scanner. Specifically, PET scanners are optimized to detect double coincidences, which occur when two photons emitted from the same annihilation event encounter opposite block detectors within a specific coincidence time window. Double coincidences provide valid, meaningful information.Scattered coincidences are also detected by the PET scanner and produce distorted information that decreases the sensitivity of PET scanners. Scatter coincidences occur when at least one of the emitted photons undergoes scattering and loses a fraction of its total energy before its detection, and the event is then detected by a pair of detectors that are non-collinear with the originating annihilation. Current methods for correcting inter-detector scatter (IDS) coincidence data involve sorting a given IDS coincidence event to the appropriate line-of-response (LOR) by determining the most likely order of detection of an IDS coincidence from the initial annihilation event. The sorted IDS coincidence data set and double coincidence data set are then merged and normalized solely based on information from the double-coincidence data set. However, this approach produces artifacts in resulting PET images, thereby reducing the sensitivity of the scanner in preclinical and clinical applications.  Increasing the sensitivity of PET systems could reduce scan time and reduce the amount of radioactive compound injected to the patient to obtain similar quality images. This invention is a specific correction for normalization of IDS events and provides the basis to calculate that correction for any event-sorting strategy and processing scheme to apply the correction to generate more accurate PET images.\n\nAdvantages: Appropriately corrects and normalizes double coincidences and IDS coincidences generated by a PET scanner. Improves sensitivity of PET scans, which will improve diagnostics and reduce the amount of radioactive tracer required"

Applications include high-performance structures for the electronics industry, magnetic and semiconducting nanowires, and quantum dot assembly.\n\nTechnology: This system is comprised of cells engineered to express surface-displayed amyloid fibers bound to heterologous polypeptides, which can in turn bind a variety of nanomaterials. The expression and assembly of multiple amyloid subunits generates complex nanostructures. The domains and patterns of the assembled structures are determined by 1) The nanomaterials attached to amyloid fibers (e.g., metals, quantum dots, proteins) 2) The binding properties of the amyloid fibers 3) Inducible control over amyloid fiber expression.\n\nProblem Addressed: The precise assembly of structures that combine organic and inorganic materials and range in size from the nanoscale to the macroscale has been a challenge for the synthetic biology and nanotechnology fields. Current technologies are generally restricted in terms of material diversity, anisotropic patterning, and the degree of control over assembly. Existing phage-based methods, for example, are limited by the length and dimensions of the phage, in addition to restricted subunit patterning due to uncontrolled, random integration (Courchesne et al. 2014).

MIT,Developer Free Positive Tone Lithography by Thermal DirectWrite,Case number: #16288,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/developer-free-positive-tone-lithography-thermal,"This technology has potential environmental and cost saving opportunities as a 2D laser direct write platform for batch processing of computational microchips and other 1D and 2D materials architectures.\n\nTechnology: Dewetting of thin films as a positive tone process through a variety of focused laser spike (FLaSK) annealing techniques is a relatively nascent technique and has only really begun to show its potential for development-free positive tone patterning of 1D or, barring overlap, 2D structures. As currently presented, it exists in two distinct forms: (1) patterning of isolated trench-ridge lines near the optical limit, and (2) patterning of subwavelength lines by overlapping the exposures. While capability (2) is more exotic, capability (1) should not be diminished; submicron 2D structures in a method that requires no developer step and only uses inexpensive, commodity polymers, free space optics, and visible (sub watt) lasers could be a potentially competitive process, especially for industrial scale fabrication tools where price is a critical concern.\n\nProblem Addressed: This system is designed to do 2D patterning via a dewetting mechanism that can reach competitive resolutions with current systems without the need for several key attributes: (1) photosensitive media, (2) post-exposure baking, and (3) development. Step (1) has two distinct implications: (1.i) Polymers for dewetting can be much cheaper than photoresist polymers (lab grade polystyrene is ~$0.20 per gram (which is 2 wt% of the solution) and coating solvent is ~$0.05 per mL compared to ~$2 per mL of a typical photoresist) and (1.ii) lab facilities where photosensitive media are handled often must have dark-room-like environments or exposure limits must be enforced. Step (2) simply reduces the number of steps. Step (3) can be a major cost consideration as labs where development is a necessity require both (3.i) a large supply of fresh developer and also (3.ii) the means to dispose of used developer. Removal of this step could present a large reduction in both the chemical costs and also the environmental footprint of a facility. Beyond equipment companies, companies who do their own in-house patterning, such as those who manufacture photomasks and stamps, could employ this method in a custom system to produce grating structures in a much more affordable fashion.\n\nAdvantages: Reduced cost and environmental effects.

The microneedles are base-coated in the UV-treated poly(o-nitro benzyl methacrylate-co-poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate polymer (PNMP), which is unstable when exposed to biological fluids. Polyelectrolyte multilayer films (PEM films) embedded with drugs are added layer by layer to the base coat of PNMP. Upon injection, the base coat of PNMP dissolves and the coats of PEM are shedded into the body, where they slowly degrade and release their contents. This system has been shown to successfully deliver a DNA vaccine consisting of a combination of adjuvants, transfection agents, and plasmid DNA in vivo in mice. The application of microneedles to the skin for 15 minutes deposits the multi-layer films to the epidermis. The films initially show a burst release of 35% of drug content and subsequently slow to a linear release for 10 days. Compared to mice injected using traditional intradermal and intramuscular methods, mice that were injected using this invention showed significantly greater immunoglobulin G titers in sera, as well as a significantly greater frequency of antigen-specific and central memory T cells two weeks following treatment. These results indicate that the invention improves upon current methods to deliver exogenous material such as DNA vaccines in a therapeutic setting.\n\nProblem Addressed: Microneedle arrays have been employed as an alternative approach to traditional needles because they are safer, more convenient, and pain-free. Upon contact with the skin, they rapidly dissolve and release the encapsulated drug. However, sustained or kinetically controlled drug release, which is especially important for certain applications such as DNA vaccine delivery, is difficult to achieve through this method. A new microneedle platform that can deliver drugs for controlled release will improve upon the current microneedle arrays in use.\n\nAdvantages: Fast and painless delivery of drugs. Modular, tunable, and flexible assembly of microneedle arrays. Controlled drug release over a span of days. Optimized for the delivery of DNA therapeutics for transfection. Significantly greater immunity compared to traditional vaccine injection methods"

MIT,Pulse-Modulated Feedback Control to Overcome HighNon-Linearities,Case number: #14017,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/pulse-modulated-feedback-control-overcome-high-non,"The technology is advantageous in any application requiring precise controlled motion in the presence of significant mechanical friction. The joints of robot manipulators are commonly actuated by rotary electric motors combined with high-ratio gear trains (including harmonic drives). High-ratio gear trains improve the torque capacity of electric motors but introduce substantial friction that varies with position and load. The hydraulic valves used to control fluid power in high-force or large-scale pipeline applications. Precise flow control requires precise control of valve position but high pressures induce substantial friction that varies with pressure. Micro-electro-mechanical motion control systems commonly encounter substantial friction. Friction in this application is especially hard to model due to the difficulty of characterizing surface irregularities. In these applications, Pulse-Modulated control can be used to eliminate the effect of friction and thus create fine movement control.\n\nTechnology: The first key idea takes advantage of the extremely rapid sampling available with modern digital control (rates of 1 KHz to 10 KHz are now routine) to generate the discontinuous ‘impulse-like’ inputs required for fine motion control in the presence of friction. Rapidly switching from zero effort to maximum effort and back is like a ‘hammer-blow’ that overcomes static friction. Rapid return to zero effort (as needed) minimizes ‘lurching’ due to stiction. The second key idea is to take advantage of friction itself to dissipate and minimize unwanted oscillations due to control action. Lightly-damped resonance (common in mechanical systems) complicates continuous control because pushing in the direction to reduce error may actually. increase. error. However, significant friction can act to suppress resonant oscillations so that the simple strategy of pushing in the direction to reduce error is effective.\n\nProblem Addressed: Friction, ubiquitous in mechanical systems, severely challenges conventional feedback control. It embodies a force-velocity relation that is discontinuous at rest (zero velocity). Conventional feedback control assumes (and usually requires) continuity. The colloquially termed ‘stiction’, static friction (zero velocity), is usually greater than sliding friction (non-zero velocity). With conventional control, stiction causes ‘lurching’ at the onset of motion. The parameters of mathematical models of friction usually depend strongly on position and loading. This dramatically increases the challenge of system identification and model-based control. This invention develops a simple feedback control strategy - Pulse-Modulated control- which effectively makes non-linearities “disappear” by guaranteeing that the error between the commanded and actual motion stays within a finite region - the result is a virtual disappearance of extreme discrepancies that could not be described by any simple analytical equation.\n\nAdvantages: Can cope effectively with friction that depends on position, direction of motion, and applied load. Versatile - it applies to any application where friction is prominent; essentially, almost any application where sliding between surfaces may occur. Easy to apply and requires minimal knowledge of plant behavior—specifically, only the maximum effort that will ensure no motion (usually zero) and the minimum actuator effort required to ensure motion (often maximum motor output). Required controller software is minimal - it may be implemented with simple programmable logic controllers. Due to its simplicity, the controller incurs minimal cost"

The repair of DNA damage results in a measurable change in fluorescent reporter protein expression. Therefore, each fluorescent reporter color corresponds to the repair of a different type or dose of DNA damage. Fluorescence is measured by flow cytometry or laser scanning cytometry. A 96 well plate of cell samples can be assessed at once, allowing for high throughput and straightforward multiplexing.\n\nProblem Addressed: In a human cell, normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as radiation can cause as many as one million individual molecular lesions per day. To maintain genetic integrity and normal cell functions, a mechanism called DNA damage repair is crucial in allowing a cell to identify DNA damage and mediate its repair. DNA repair capacities differ between species and individuals within species. Quantifying this difference is important for research purposes and for clinical diagnostics (e.g. personalized disease prevention, prescribing chemotherapy tailored to an individual patient based on differences in DNA repair capacity of the patient). Furthermore, the different types of DNA damage necessitate different molecular pathways of DNA repair.\n\nAdvantages: Targets several different pathways in a single assay.

MIT,Motion InvariantPhotography,Case number: #13075,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/motion-invariant-photography,"Object motion during camera exposure often leads to noticeable blurring artifacts. Proper elimination of this blur is challenging because the blur kernel is unknown, varies over the image as a function of object velocity, and destroys high frequencies. In the case of motions along a 1D direction (e.g. horizontal), applicants show that these challenges can be addressed using a camera that moves during the exposure. Through the analysis of motion blur as space-time integration, applicants show that a parabolic integration (corresponding to constant sensor acceleration) leads to motion blur that is not only invariant to object velocity, but preserves image frequency content nearly optimally. That is, static objects are degraded relative to their image from a static camera, but all moving objects within a given range of motions reconstruct well. A single deconvolution kernel can be used to remove blur and create sharp images of scenes with objects moving at different speeds, without requiring any segmentation and without knowledge of the object speeds."

MIT,A Means of Turbocharging Single Cylinder Internal Combustion Engines Using an AirCapacitor,Case number: #16438K,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/means-turbocharging-single-cylinder-internal,"Turbocharging technology for single cylinder engines is applicable to a variety of current and prospective single cylinder diesel engine markets, including tractors, generators, water pumps, rickshaws, motorcycles, lawn mowers, and landscaping equipment.\n\nTechnology: This invention presents a solution for turbocharging single cylinder internal combustion engines by adding an air capacitor to the intake manifold of the engine. During the exhaust stroke of the engine, the turbocharger is mechanically powered by the exhaust gases to compress fresh air. The fresh air is stored in an air capacitor until the intake valve is opened, at which point the pressure in the air capacitor forces fresh air into the cylinder. An optimal capacitor to engine volume ratio allows 80% or more of the turbocharger pressure to be delivered throughout the intake stroke and will not contribute significantly to turbo lag. For smaller capacity engines in the range of 625 cc, the increase in engine size due to an additional air capacitor would be minor. Experimentally,  30% more power has been achieved with a turbocharger single cylinder engine with an air capacitor, compared to the same naturally aspirated engine. It should be possible to produce 40-60% more power in future iterations. The capacitor can be modified to include cooling fins, which would increase the density of its stored air. The capacitor can also be built into the structure of the vehicle such as the frame tubing on a motorcycle or a rickshaw.\n\nProblem Addressed: Turbocharging increases the power per capacity of internal combustion engines by forcing more fresh air into the combustion chamber to burn more fuel. However, single cylinder engines are difficult to turbocharge because the intake valve is closed when the exhaustive valve is open. This problem is usually surmounted by adding more cylinders, but in smaller vehicles such as tractors and generators, the engine cost is a large fraction of the overall price of vehicle production. Thus, turbocharging single cylinder engines would have an economic advantage over turbocharging multi-cylinder engines.\n\nAdvantages: 40-60% higher specific power output of turbocharging single cylinder internal combustion engines compared to engines using natural aspiration (30% achieved so far). Lower cost of production for single cylinder engines compared to multi-cylinder engines 80% or more of turbocharger pressure delivered throughout the intake stroke. Only a small increase in engine size for smaller capacity engines"
MIT,Metal Spacer Enhanced Permeate Gap Membrane Distillation for Energy EfficientDesalination,Case number: #16943,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/metal-spacer-enhanced-permeate-gap-membrane,"This invention uses high conductivity spacer materials on the condensate side of a permeate gap membrane distillation (PGMD) system to increase the effective conductivity of the gap and improve flux and energy efficiency. This can be used to increase the efficiency of membrane distillation processes for desalination, food processing and waste treatment applications.\n\nTechnology: Membrane distillation for desalination involves the passage of hot salt water over a microporous, hydrophobic membrane that allows pure water vapor through while retaining the dissolved salts in solution. In the PGMD design, the other side of this membrane contains a water column that fills the entire region between the membrane and the condensing surface. The gaps in the PGMD systems include a spacer material, often made of plastic, to hold the membrane in place.This technology uses conductive metal spacers in an enhanced PGMD system. Detailed modeling of the heat and heat mass transfer processes shows the high conductivity spacer yielding positive effects, including a greatly reduced transport resistance across the gap and up to twice the energy efficiency of other membrane distillation configurations. The gap conductivity can be increased by using a metal mesh, metallic wool or any porous metal medium. The material used should be corrosion resistant as it is in continuous contact with liquid water.\n\nProblem Addressed: Membrane distillation (MD) is used to separate the more volatile components of a mixture via phase change. MD is well-suited for harnessing solar and geothermal energy sources and is often used in off-grid desalination applications. Meanwhile, the overall market is dominated by large-scale, multi-stage distillation systems that produce millions of gallons of desalinated water per day with low energy consumption. The inventors have developed a permeate gap (PGMD) system that shows promise for higher efficiencies as these large-scale systems with lower capital investments.\n\nAdvantages: Metal spacers improve flux and energy efficiency of PGMD system. PGMD system has low capital investments compared to large scale distillation systems. System doesn’t require complex parts such as vacuum pumps or pressure chambers. Low construction costs"
MIT,Superelastic Shape Memory Ceramic Particles and the PreparationTherefore,Case number: #16922J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/superelastic-shape-memory-ceramic-particles-and,"Superelastic shape memory ceramics (SMCs) exhibit a combination of high strength, large recoverable strain, large energy damping, and are light weight. These features are useful as an energy-damping layer for armor systems or as an energy absorber for automobiles, sports equipment, and aerospace applications.\n\nTechnology: SMC particles can be prepared in large scale by a solid-state sintering method modified with polymers containing rich aromatic rings, or a spray drying method. The crystal structure of the particles is controlled by using a fast sintering scheme and the particle size distribution is controlled by tuning the precursor viscosity, inlet temperature, and gas pressure. The resulting samples exhibit highly repeatable superelasticity with cycling over one hundred times at strains up to 7% compared to regular polycrystalline zirconia that cracks at strains of 1-2% and after only a few cycles.  Additionally, these ceramics can withstand very large stresses (~0.5-3GPa) and reversibly damp mechanical energy up to ~40MJ/m3, which is much higher than that of shape memory alloys, fiber-reinforced composites, or rubbers.  The SMC particles can be used as a filler in composites with polymer, metal or ceramics as matrix to enhance their energy absorbance or used alone as a powder compact for impact energy damping. Figure 1 shows the working mechanism of the SMC particles.\n\nProblem Addressed: Zirconia has a well-studied martensitic transformation between tetragonal (austenite) and monoclinic (martensite) phases with associated shear strains of up to 16%. However, the mismatch stresses in the polycrystalline zirconia prevents the shape memory and superelastic behavior and induces brittle fracture failure in the material. This technology solves the cracking problem by creating small-volume ceramics with few crystals in particle form, such that they have a large free surface area and few grain boundaries to enable robust superelasticity properties.\n\nAdvantages: Highly reliable and repeatable.

In this invention, the salmochelin is linked to antibiotics with polyetheylene glycol linkers. The modified salmochelin binds to receptors on the cell membrane and delivers its conjugated antibody into the bacteria. Modified salmochelin is advantageous to non-native antibiotic models because its mechanism of delivery involves native cell machinery. This allows for enhanced recognition and delivery. Moreover, modified salmochelin can easily be adapted to deliver non-antibiotic entities into pathogens, such as other toxic molecules, or even fluorophores or biotin.\n\nProblem Addressed: Antibiotic resistance has long been a cause for concern in the microbiology community. Most conventional methods of countering the development of resistance focus on the creation of new antibiotics that target intracellular processes; however, gram-negative bacteria possess an outer membrane that acts as a barrier to antibiotic entry. Spontaneous mutations in these membranes provide gram-negative bacteria new methods of antibiotic resistance. A novel method for the intracellular delivery of existing antibiotics may provide an additional means of targeting pathogenic gram-negative bacteria that bypasses the outer membrane barrier.\n\nAdvantages: Combats the development of antibiotic resistance, which occurs when the outer membrane in gram-negative pathogens undergo spontaneous mutation. Specific targeting of pathogenic bacteria compared to commensal bacteria. Exploitation of native cell machinery to deliver antibiotics. Capability of delivering non-antibiotic constructs into pathogens as well"
MIT,High Throughput Isolation of Antigen-Specific Antibodies andCells,Case number: #16927J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/high-throughput-isolation-antigen-specific-antibodies,"Point of care detection of HIV and other infectious diseases, which require multiplexed detection; Microfluidic separation and isolation of antibodies; Microfluidic separation and isolation of cells; Affinity purification in a column\n\nTechnology: Multiplexed isolation of rare antibodies, proteins or cells from complex mixtures is a process essential for disease diagnosis and drug development.  However, current methods, such as affinity chromatography and flow cytometry, can be time and labor intensive when used for interrogating more than a single protein in a sample, and are not well-suited for detecting rare events due to their relatively low throughput.  Professor Jay Han and colleagues have developed a novel method to isolate rare proteins and cells in complex biological samples by flowing a sample incubated with antibody-coated beads of different sizes in a spiral microfluidic channel.  The device takes advantage of the principles of inertial microfluidics to separate the differently sized beads, each bound to a different protein of interest, with high fidelity and throughput.  This system has a variety of applications, ranging from sample purification in pharmaceutical contexts to point of care disease diagnosis, and can be easily adapted for multiplexing.\n\nProblem Addressed: This is a device for isolating individual antibodies, proteins or cells from a complex mixture, and it addresses the current technology's inefficiencies.\n\nAdvantages: Versatile tool that can be used for research, industrial and clinical purposes. Multiplexed and high throughput. Can work with small or large volume sample. High specificity. Low cost. Sample can be easily analyzed with downstream tools"
MIT,"Methods, Materials and Systems for Voltage Programming MaterialProperties",Case number: #16957,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/methods-materials-and-systems-voltage-programming,"Applications for this technology include electrically controllable catalysts for the chemical industry, voltage-controlled low-power magnetic memories, and voltage-controlled optical switches. Some additional applications of this technology allow for the creation of environmentally-responsive materials, low cost sensors, and lab-on-a-chip systems.\n\nTechnology: This invention has a multi-layer architecture, which contains a central bi-layer material sandwiched between metal electrodes. The bi-layer is comprised of the target material to be electronically modified, and a functional material with mobile ionic species. The application of an electric field across the structure of the device causes the ionic species within the functional material to affect the chemical composition of the thin target layer and change its properties. Additionally, a “write head” may be used to control the local voltage or temperature, allowing for spatially-varying material properties.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current techniques for nano-fabrication of materials- annealing, particle bombardment, and plasma exposure - are able to change material properties; however, these processes are difficult to control and are non-reversible. In addition, these current techniques do not allow for spatial control of the material properties. This invention allows for a highly manipulative and completely reversible nano-fabrication platform.\n\nAdvantages: Permits post-synthesis modification of nano-materials. Reversible. Ability to create spatially-varying material properties"
MIT,Compiler for PrintableRobots,Case number: #16959,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/compiler-printable-robots,"This technology finds application in the field of robotics, specifically in customizable personal robots that could be created to tackle everyday tasks by users who are not necessarily technology experts.\n\nTechnology: This technology describes a means to create customizable, 3D printed robots with folding structures inspired from Origami, from high level structural specifications. This is done by creating libraries of basic building blocks and pre-designed mechanisms, which can then be connected together to make custom robot assemblies. While technology experts can focus on creating new building blocks, a casual user can printed these out on a 3D printer, and then assemble them using files and instructions generated by the system. The robotic device assembled thus can be controlled via system generated user interface on a smartphone. This disclosure entails several robots that prove the versatility of this approach.\n\nProblem Addressed: While robots have been in use for decades now in commercial and research applications, they have not been adapted well for personal use. Creating a robot typically takes time, effort and infrastructure, which may not be a feasible investment for a casual user.\n\nAdvantages: Enables creation of robots for custom tasks without heavy investment in infrastructure. Users without high technology expertise can create robots for personal use"
MIT,Superhydrophobic Condensing Surfaces for Air Gap MembraneDistillation,Case number: #16942,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/superhydrophobic-condensing-surfaces-air-gap-membrane,"This invention provides for significantly improved condensate production and thermal performance of an air gap membrane distillation (AGMD) system. This can be used to increase the efficiency of membrane distillation processes for desalination, food processing, and waste treatment applications.\n\nTechnology: Recent research suggests that hydrophobic surfaces can have 5-7 times the heat transfer coefficient of laminar film condensing. This invention consists of employing hydrophobic condensing in AGMD. In typical AGMD, a hot saline feed side passes a hydrophobic membrane, which allows hot water vapor through but not saline liquid water. The vapor crosses an air gap and is condensed on a condensing surface. The condensing surface may be cooled by a cold stream, or in multistage configurations, feed streams at progressively lower temperatures.The inventors paired superhydrophobic condensation surfaces with untreated and superhydrophobic air gap support meshes of high and low conductivities to determine optimum conditions for energy efficient permeate production in AGMD. They determined that introducing superhydrophobic surfaces can result in an up to 110% improved efficiency for AGMD desalination. Superhydrophobic condensation conditions at varied feed and cold side temperatures are recommended for substantial improvement for AGMD systems.\n\nProblem Addressed: Membrane distillation is a thermal desalination technology which can provide small-scale desalination. AGMD is an MD configuration with an air-filled cavity between the membrane and condensing surface, traditionally with laminar film condensation. The thermal resistance of the air gap prevents conduction between the cooling surface and hot feed, making AGMD the most efficient mainstream MD technology, at the cost of a large associated mass transfer resistance from diffusion through the air gap. This creates a trade-off between system size and efficiency for AGMD, which requires large condensing areas to be superior.\n\nAdvantages: Superhydrophobic surfaces offer significantly increased efficiency for MD desalination. Method improves AGMD condensate flux"
MIT,Design Interconnects for Finer Pitch Assembly Suitable for Commercial and MilitaryApplications,Case number: #16918L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/design-interconnects-finer-pitch-assembly-suitable,"This interconnect technology was designed to support military applications, however, the devices may support the miniaturization of electronic products such as mobile phones, tablets, and digital cameras while providing enhanced sensor processing and communication performance.\n\nTechnology: The presented technology reduces interconnect width, allowing a reduced pitch in comparison to conventional semiconductor structures and devices. This is accomplished with a semiconductor structure composed of a substrate, interconnect pad, and an isolating layer where one or more conductive structure projecting from the surface of an interconnect pad form a connection for electrically and mechanically coupling the semiconductor structure to other semiconductor structures and devices. The electrical connections may be made by drilling holes through the substrate in appropriate locations and plating the inside of the holes with a conducting material (e.g., copper). The interconnect pad is provided to promote scalability of the semiconductor structure since it can couple to other semiconductor structures or devices. An isolating layer includes a polymer, which may be used as a dielectric bridge for crossover of circuits within the same layer of substrate. This dielectric bridge may be created by selective deposition of a dielectric material (e.g., nanoporous silica, silicon oxyfluoride) using physical or chemical vapor deposition. Openings in the isolating layer may be formed by an additive or subtractive process which accommodates one or more conductive structures that fits between the interconnect pad and isolating layer. These processing conditions are cheaper and less bulky than conventional methods of reducing pitch size.\n\nProblem Addressed: Today’s military and commercial electronics demand increased density, enhanced mobility, and extended operational life. In addition, new electronic packages require low loss, lightweight structures, higher electrical performance, and mixed material construction with the structural stability to accommodate the complexity associated with size, weight and power optimization. This requires the integration of multiple interconnected structures, yielding die with greater function, higher I/O counts and smaller pitches. While it is desirable to reduce interconnect pitch, relatively simple and cost effective approaches are needed in order for such a technology to be practical. Current conventional interconnects, such as solder pads, self-aligned contact pads, bond wires, and conductive pads, are bulky and their associated pitch is not easily reduced. This results in a less effective use of the space on the integrated circuit and a less powerful circuit overall.\n\nAdvantages: Shortens assembly and package construction timesImproved RF performance due to conversion to flip-chip from wire bondable package. Reduced pad size and spacing to convert standard substrates to finer pitch substrates. Reduced total interconnect resistance, less power dissipation"
MIT,Electrically Conducting Two-Dimensional Materials With Metal-Ortho-PhenylenediimineUnits,Case number: #16971,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/electrically-conducting-two-dimensional-materials,"The described method generates metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that conduct electricity. These materials have applications in the semiconductor, chemical, and electronics industries. They can act as active materials in electrical energy storage devices such as supercapacitors, and as electrochemical sensors, electrocatalysts, or various electronic devices such as light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic solar cells, and transistors.\n\nTechnology: This invention replaces conventional organic building blocks for MOFs with molecules containing ortho-diimine groups, which self-assemble, together with metals, into two-dimensional sheets resembling graphene. The square-planar metal-bis(phenylenediimine) connections established in these new materials, termed metal-organic graphene analogs (MOGs), lead to excellent charge delocalization across the MOF metal node and a considerable improvement in the materials’ electrical properties, making them more attractive for applications in the semiconductor and electronic device industry as well as in the electrical energy storage industry. These novel sMOGs are synthesized by reacting organic ligands containing at least two ortho-phenylenediamine groups with metal salts. The organic ligands are oxidized and each ortho-phenylenediamine group is transformed into an ortho-phenylenediimine group, which binds to the metal ion. Oxidation and formation of the ortho-diimine group is essential for electrical conductivity.The inventors have identified a compound, Ni(isq)2, as a target for the construction of a fully charged-delocalized s-MOG. Ni(isq)2 is fully π-conjugated with its ground state having partial singlet biradical character. The inventors perform a 2D extension of Ni(isq)2 ­­by reacting hexaaminotriphenylene hexahydrochloride (HATP 6HCl) with ammoniacal NiCl2 to produce a new crystalline s-MOG with very high electrical conductivity that is linearly proportion to its temperature. The conductivity of this new material vastly exceeds those of previous s-MOGs and other conductive MOFs and is higher than even some of the best organic conductors, rivaling graphite itself.\n\nProblem Addressed: MOFs and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) present exceptional porosity and surface area, and are thus considered exceptional gas storage materials. However, their charge mobility and electrical conductivity have been very low, such that MOFs and COFs can effectively be categorized as insulators. The lack of electrical conductivity is due to the type of functionalities typically used to connect metals and organic ligands, which are not conducive to charge transport.\n\nAdvantages: Method amenable to chemical functionalization, allowing for tunable electrical properties. MOGs have similar electronic properties to graphene but offer greater compositional tunability. MOGs using metal ortho-phenylenediimine groups offer improved electrical conductivity over those using other types of organic ligands"
MIT,System and Method for Data Compression with Model FreeEncoding,Case number: #16907,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/system-and-method-data-compression-model-free,"This invention is a highly efficient and flexible algorithm for data compression. Data compression has a wide range of applications from compressing data stores of new and existing data types, to improving end-to-end performance for stored and streaming network applications, and allowing for increased privacy and content protection at upstream sites, among many others.\n\nTechnology: The compression of data is predicated on the existence of certain predictable or typical statistical characteristics in data, which must be identified by expert or inferred by algorithm. This information is called the source model, because it models the statistical source from which the data is presumed to be drawn. The technology the Inventors present, called “compression with model-free encoding,” is based on the surprising discovery that the source model, a key piece of information for any compression system, does not need to be known at the upstream encoder at all for efficient compression to take place. This recognition is counterintuitive and offers a substantially different way of performing compression than current methods. The technology therefore entails new algorithms for encoders, decoders and other system components, which may have application beyond data compression.Compression with model-free encoding is completed by “blindly” decimating the original data in the upstream encoder to an agreed upon rate. The output of this process is a set of succinct but potentially non-unique specifications on the data: this is the compressed data stream. In the downstream decoder, these specifications are combined with the statistical characteristics of the data type, i.e. the source model, to recover a solution that agrees with the original data.\n\nProblem Addressed: Data compression reduces costs of data transmission and storage by reproducing the same or nearly the same data using more succinct descriptions. A compression system comprises an upstream encoder and a downstream decoder, the internal algorithm for both of which must be carefully designed to maximize compression efficiency. To operate, the encoder and/or the decoder typically use knowledge about the special characteristic of the data. However, whether specialized knowledge is used in the system, the downstream system is dependent on the particular choice, which reduces flexibility in system design and network transport, prevent future improvement without a significant overhaul to the entire system and losing compatibility with already compressed data. The Inventors have developed a technology to compress data in a novel way that defers nearly all assumed knowledge about the data until the downstream decoder—without losing compression efficiency.\n\nAdvantages: The system presents a low barrier to not only improvement but to the initial design.. Design principles can be applied to compress any type of data, providing valuable adaptability to handle “big data” fields (e.g. bioscience, finance) and upgrade compression of traditional data (e.g. video, audio, images, natural language text and databases)"
MIT,Space-Time Modulated Active 3DImager-on-Chip,Case number: #16889L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/space-time-modulated-active-3d-imager-chip,"Technology uses:\n\nAutonomous unmanned air vehicles and driverless/driver-assisted cars\n3D gaming, simulation, training in high-fidelity virtual replicas of real-world environments, augmented reality visualization, consumer mobile 3D photography\nGPS-denied navigation and human navigation in obscured or unknown environments\nHome marketing, appraisal, safety inspection, renovation modeling or energy survey\nMovie production (capturing virtual representations of real-world sets)\n\nTechnology: The Space-Time Modulated Active 3D Imager-on-chip is a tightly-integrated system of a laser light source, optical elements, photo-sensitive focal plane array, and integrated circuit electronics. Functionally, the main system components are the source, the detector, and the processing system. The light produced by the source bounces off of the scene and back to the detector; the processing algorithm is then able to infer the 3D structure of the scene by comparing the detected image to a known, pre-calibrated reference image. The sensor provides a dense 2D map within its field-of-view with a depth map for preservation of the 3D structure. The device can operate at a high frame-rate, so that the sequence of images output can be viewed as a full-motion video. This on-chip imager enables a high-fidelity capture of the scene with low size, weight and power requirements.\n\nProblem Addressed: Three-dimensional (3D) sensing capabilities has become important in the defense, commercial and industrial sectors. However, existing 3D imaging technologies cannot meet the stringent size, weight, and power requirements for a variety of day/night, medium-range applications. Many existing image detector schemes suffer from readout circuitry bottlenecks, including limited data rate and high read noise. Furthermore, applications such as advanced unmanned systems exceed current imaging capabilities.\n\nAdvantages: Indoor/Outdoor day/night operation with small size, weight and power requirements. Extended maximum range and wide field-of-view at high resolution. Robust to featureless/feature-aliased environments and sensor platform motion. Entirely on-chip computation; no external processing required with easy integration with other imaging devices"
MIT,Virtual Touch Screen in the Air Using RFSignals,Case number: #16879,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/virtual-touch-screen-air-using-rf-signals,"The inventors have developed a device that tracks the location and detailed trajectory of radio frequency sources (e.g. RFIDs) moving in 3D space. This device can transform any plane or surface into a virtual touch screen, whereby users can interact with a desired computing device by gesturing or writing commands in the air. This interface can be used to interact with a remote screen, to send commands to a cellphone without touching it, or to communicate with small devices (e.g., sensors) that do not have space for a keyboard.\n\nTechnology: The inventors have developed RF-IDraw, a novel technology to accurately trace the trajectory of an RFID. This system offers tracing capabilities accurate enough to transform any plane or surface in space into a virtual touch screen, enabling human-computer interfacing without physically touching a screen. RF-IDraw allows a user to input commands on any surface by writing, scrolling and swiping using an RFID attached to a pen or finger splint. RF-IDraw can reconstruct the RFID’s trajectory and interpret the user’s writing and gestures as input to the desired computing device.RF-IDraw’s technology leverages multiple antennas to yield a significant improvement in both tracing and localization accuracy. The device measures the phases of the received signals at the different antennas and uses knowledge of the antenna positions to create a geometric model for estimating the RF source’s position and tracing its detailed trajectory. The beam steering capability of the antenna array is utilized to pinpoint the direction and location of the source. To obtain a high level of accuracy, RF-IDraw pairs these antennas with differing levels of separation: the pairs with larger separation have narrow beams and provide resolution in the positioning system, while the pairs with smaller separation work as filters to eliminate ambiguity in the system. This technology also offers real-time processing functionalities integrated with handwriting recognition features.\n\nProblem Addressed: RF-based positioning has become the next frontier for innovation in mobile computing, business analytics, and human-computer interaction. Advancements in RF-based technology to-date have enabled the localization of RF sources to an accuracy of tens of centimeters. However, little has been done to further accurately track an RFID’s motion trajectory. This detailed, real-time motion tracking is critical for application of RF technology for gaming and gesture-based interfaces and requires a resolution several-fold higher than what existing RF-based localizing systems can offer.\n\nAdvantages: Device can be used to turn virtually any surface into a touch screen capable of human-computer interfacing. Technology can be applied to multiple users with one or multiple RFIDs. System works even if the user is occluded from the device"
MIT,A GHz-Wide Receiver for SparseSpectra,Case number: #16973,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/ghz-wide-receiver-sparse-spectra,"Some major applications for this technology are found in real time spectrum monitoring, dynamic spectrum allocation, spectrum sensing, cognitive radio, and concurrent decoding of diverse signals (cellular, WiFi, Blue Tooth, etc.).\n\nTechnology: This technology allows the use of low cost commercially available transceiver components operating in a narrow bandwidth to generate a receiver with a bandwidth much wider than the sum of the components. The result is a wideband receiver at the cost structure of a narrowband WiFi receiver. The technology utilizes a new sparse FFT (sFFT) algorithm tailored for spectrum acquisition. The algorithm allows capturing and recovering a sparse signal using a significantly lower sampling rate than that dictated by the Nyquist criterion. Additionally, for non-sparse signals, the invention uses dynamic spectrum sensing to measure changes in the spectrum. This differential signal is sparse, and allows accurate spectrum sensing even for more highly occupied spectral regions.\n\nProblem Addressed: Monitoring and sensing a broadband spectrum (GHz) currently requires the use of either high speed ADCs and very long FFT with custom hardware that consumes significant power, or sequentially scanning one narrow band at a time that is slow and prone to missing short term signals.\n\nAdvantages: GHz wide receiver at the cost structure of a narrowband WiFi receiver. Uses cheap, low-power, off-the-shelf hardware. Transceiver can sense a signal as well as decode it. Differential algorithm allows fast sensing even of a non-sparse spectrum.

MIT,PolyMOFs: Hybrid Materials With Combined Gel and MOF Properties Via Metal-Ligand Coordination andSelf-Assembly,Case number: #16872,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/polymofs-hybrid-materials-combined-gel-and-mof,"Drug / fragrance / pollutant encapsulation, Controlled release, Separations / chromatography, Water purification / filtration\n\nTechnology: Many polymer materials are structurally stable until they encounter some form of large mechanical strain. Following extreme deformation, such polymers lose their utility. This new invention from the Johnson lab presents a polymer class that combines the material stability of polymer networks like hydrogels or rubber with self-healing properties derived from metal-ligand self-assembly. Importantly, cage-like assemblies are formed that lead to a novel porous material architecture. The self-healing properties of polyMOCs arise from special interactions between the many telechelic polymers that compose the materials. A telechelic polymer here refers to a polymer that has the same functional group on each of its ends. In the case of a polyMOC, telechelic polymers have ligands on the end of each polymer chain, and these ligands possess a binding affinity to certain metal ions. Due to thermodynamic favorability, these ligands coordinate around the metal ion with a controlled geometry, driving the junctions to self-assemble into muli-metal, multi-ligand clusters of defined 3D nano-scale geometry. The spontaneous formation of an organized network can be tuned to form unique three-dimensional shapes, yielding materials that restore their metal-ligand coordinated shape even when the material is strained or perturbed. The inventors have demonstrated that polyMOC gels can successfully encase doxorubicin, a common therapeutic tumor drug.\n\nProblem Addressed: Polymer networks and gels typically have very different properties compared to crystalline metal-coordinated assemblies. This technology from the Johnson lab presents a new polymer class that merges the properties of traditional hydrogels with metal-coordinated cages to provide gels with self-healing and selective uptake and release properties.\n\nAdvantages: Upon exposure to mechanical failure, the material can self-heal to its original conformation. This material can be used as a novel molecular encapsulation device that can uptake or release compounds over time through its porous architecture. The material can also selectively uptake certain metal ions"
MIT,Composite LayerStamp,Case number: #16796KJ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/composite-layer-stamp,"This technology has applications in the printing industry generally, specifically in soft lithography; imprint and microcontact printing of molecular or fluid inks on flexible webs (e.g., printed electronics). The ability to produce stamps with layers of varying properties leverages a great set of sensing and actuating methods which allow for the precise, high resolution, continuous and cost-effective printing of displays, circuits, photovoltaics and other devices on flexible substrates.\n\nTechnology: The inventors developed a bi-/multi-layer PDMS (silicone) soft-lithography stamp. One layer is either chemically modified or doped with fluorescent particles or dye, so that functional groups, molecules or particles provide different optical or electrical properties. This stamp is used for microcontact printing. The stamp is produced by an additive manufacturing fashion, casting layers on top of each other. Each layer is entirely or partially crosslinked by the time the next layer is cast. The stamp material is cast into a centrifuge to create a seamless cylindrical stamp. To create the mold on the inner surface of the centrifuge, two layers of photoresistive polymer are applied to it: a fully-covering coat for creating a planar surface and a laser-structured layer that provides the pattern. The technique of varying optical properties allows for new methods of continuous inspection and control of the printing process. Other functional properties can be introduced to the layers with regard to applications in advanced metrology and contact control; such layers could provide for various sensing, actuating or thermal control purposes.\n\nProblem Addressed: In microcontact printing, selective contact between the substrate and the micro- or nano-scale features on the stamp results in transfer of a molecular or fluid ink.  The proposed layered stamp alter layer optical properties.  Transmission of UV light generates a high-contrast image of the printing zone, a region of conformal contact between the patterned stamp and the impression surface. The clear visibility of the contact areas allows continuous (in-line) inspection of the printing process, and hence greater active control capabilities to meet rapidly increasing resolution demands of micro / nano printed substrates.\n\nAdvantages: Low-cost stamp. Few moving parts with more range of flexibility. Varied optical properties of layers allows for new methods of control and inspection during printing process"
MIT,Siderophore-Based Immunization Against Gram-NegativeBacteria,Case number: #16976J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/siderophore-based-immunization-against-gram-negative,"Siderophore-based immunization holds promise as a new vaccine strategy against pathogenic bacteria in humans and other animals. Its principles may also be applied to produce antibodies for passive immunization. These antibodies may be applied to a variety of conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nTechnology: This invention involves the production, application, and uptake assessment of salmochelin conjugated with cholera toxin B (CTB) or keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), immune-stimulating carrier proteins. The conjugates were produced with PEG3 linkers connected CTB to the salmochelin using a peptide coupling strategy to bond lysine residues on the carrier protein to a free carboxylic acid on the PEG3 linker. Mice immunized intranasally with the conjugate were observed to possess antibodies against salmochelin in circulation for up to 51 days after the first immunization, with a novel ELISA. Immunized mice showed less weight loss after infection with Salmonella typhimurium and colonization within the intestines of the infected mice correlated with the amount IgA detected in the novel ELISA. Finally, microbiota assessment of the immunized mice revealed substantially lower levels of the pathogenic Salmonella and higher levels of beneficial microbes like Lactobacillus.\n\nProblem Addressed: Salmochelins are highly conserved small metal ion chelators, also known as siderophores, synthesized by pathogenic gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Salmonella enterica, and certain Klebsiella strains) in the stomach and small intestines. Salmochelins are vital to the survival of these pathogenic strains, and because they cannot be bound and destroyed by the host organism's natural response system, they enhance bacterial virulence. The ability to introduce immunogenic carrier proteins to salmochelin-producing strains of bacteria would provide general immunization against all of these pathogenic strains simultaneously.\n\nAdvantages: Conservancy of siderophore genes amongst multiple pathogenic bacterial strains makes siderophores attractive targets for immunizations. Siderophore-based immunization may be applicable to E. coli and Klebsiella in addition to Salmonella. Potential increase in beneficial microbiota after immunization. Production of antibodies for passive immunization, which may be of therapeutic value to conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome"
MIT,Enhanced Flow Boiling Heat Transfer Through Microstructures to Decouple Heat Transfer and FlowInstabilities,Case number: #16829,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/enhanced-flow-boiling-heat-transfer-through,"Two-phase microchannel heat sinks can be used for thermal management of electronic devices such as central processing units (CPUs), concentrated photovoltaics, power electronics, and laser diodes.\n\nTechnology: The two-phase microchannel consists of channels filled with micropillars, fabricated out of a Si wafer using deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) and a Pyrex glass wafer with inlet and outlet holes. The fabricated microchannels were 500µm x 500µm x 10mm with micropillar arrays (heights of ~25µm, diameters of 5-10µm and pitches of 10-40µm) on the bottom channel wall, where heat is applied. This design suggests that two-phase heat transfer and fluid flow behavior can be decoupled allowing the overall heat flux to increase. Bubbles are generated via the less hydrophilic sidewalls while the superhydrophilic microstructures at the bottom of the channel enhance the capillary wicking capability to prevent dryout.\n\nProblem Addressed: Electronic systems such as power electronics and laser diodes typically exceed heat fluxes of 1000 W/cm2. Current thermal management systems including heat pipes, and pool boiling have achieved heat fluxes of 100-250 W/cm2, which is not high enough for many systems. This two-phase microchannel heat sink in a custom closed loop test setup demonstrated heat flux >900 W/cm2 with mass flux of ~300 kg/m2s and 3-8 oC temperature fluctuations. The improved performance is attributed to the microstructured surfaces which suppressed dry-out via capillarity within the microchannels.\n\nAdvantages: Increased critical heat flux. Increased flow stability. Thermal management solution for high performance electronic devices"
MIT,Enhancing and Disrupting Memory by BrainOscillations,Case number: #16856P,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/enhancing-and-disrupting-memory-brain-oscillations,"Technology applications:\n\nEnhancement of memory formation\nImprovement of learning ability and reinforcement of existing learning\nSelective disruption and weakening of intrusive, traumatic memories\nTreatment for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease\n\nTechnology: The technology relies on the discovery of an extremely low-frequency communication between two parts of the brain - the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus  - during the processes of memory formation and memory disruption. Dr.  Earl Miller and colleagues discovered that the two parts of the brain communicate at “beta” (9-6 Hz) and “theta” (2-6 Hz) frequencies when memories are being formed and erased, respectively. A technology capable of influencing these processes uses low-voltage transcranial electrical stimulation operating at these two frequencies. Stimulating at these natural frequencies provides a unique opportunity to correct and enhance memory formation processes in a non-invasive manner.\n\nProblem Addressed: Human capability to learn new information is often slow, laborious, and error-prone, particularly in cases involving memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease or age-related memory loss. Existing processes of memory enhancement and disruption are limited to shock therapy, which is dangerous and well-known for its severe side-effects. Currently, there are no means for non-invasive, non-therapeutic brain enhancement or memory manipulation; however, such capability could be of great benefit.\n\nAdvantages: Non-invasive and non-pharmacological approach towards memory formation process. Relies on a well-established electrical stimulation technology operating at extremely low frequencies and low voltages. Potential to affect a broad range of physiological processes, that currently include, but are not limited to, memory formation and disruption. Potential to affect  memory formation process in both clinical and non-clinical situations"
MIT,Reducing View Transitions Artifacts in AutomultiscopicDisplays,Case number: #16850,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/reducing-view-transitions-artifacts-automultiscopic,"This technology improves visual quality in multi-view autostereoscopic (automultiscopic) displays. These displays provide an immersive, glasses-free 3D viewing experience and are widely regarded to be the future of television and cinema.\n\nTechnology: The images observed on an automultiscopic screen correspond to a cut through the light field created by the screen. Unlike in real world, the light fields produced by automultiscopic screens have a repetitive structure. When the viewing position is not optimal this induces image quality-degrading visual artifacts. To avoid transitions artifacts, the light field produced by an automultiscopic display must be continuous. This method employs techniques in seamless image and video editing to cut and stitch together different copies of the light field images into one natural, continuous composition.Local and global shearing techniques are applied to refine the light field by aligning the structure of its repetitive fragments. These fragments are then overlapped to find an optimal cut, upon which they are stitched together using Poisson reconstruction techniques. This method produces reconstructed, continuous light fields with reduced disparities and transition artifacts, therefore exhibiting improved visual quality. In contrast to previous hardware solutions, this optimization does not require knowledge about viewer’s position, which makes the technique suitable for an arbitrary number of observers.\n\nProblem Addressed: Automultiscopic displays enable glasses-free 3D viewing by providing both binocular and motion parallax effects. Within the display’s field of view, different images are observed depending on the viewing direction. When moving outside the field of view, the observed images may repeat, inducing visual artifacts in the form of discontinuities, depth reversals, and binocular disparities. These artifacts degrade visual quality and restrict the usage of automultiscopic screens in home applications and large scale visualizations. The Inventors have developed a method to improve automulticopic visual quality by modifying the presented image to be more continuous, reducing transition artifacts in the display.\n\nAdvantages: Method does not require hardware modifications. Technique can be applied without knowledge about viewer’s position. Applicable for both static images and videos using parallax barriers and lenticular sheets"
MIT,Enhanced Quantum Spin-Sensing Using Light Trapping in a Massively Multimode DiamondResonator,Case number: #16809,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/enhanced-quantum-spin-sensing-using-light-trapping,"Technology applications:\n\nThermometry\nMagnetometry\nElectric field sensing\nInertial sensing\nTimekeeping\n\nTechnology: The invention is a room temperature bulk diamond sensor on a massively multimode resonate design. The invention includes a method for enhancing the signal generated from bulk diamond plates. First, an ensemble of diamonds with nitrogen vacancies are prepared. Second, laser light is trapped within the diamonds. The light will interact with the nitrogen vacancies, which will alter the trajectory of the beams. A fraction of the light will eventually escape. The location and intensity of the emitted light is reflective of the spin state of the diamond at the nitrogen vacancies. Thus, quantum spin-sensing measurements can be measured by careful observation of the emitted light. Finally, as the spin state is sensitive to changes in the environment, such as temperature and magnetic field strength, this system is a highly sensitive bulk diamond sensor.\n\nProblem Addressed: A nitrogen vacancy is a point defect in a diamond. Point defects have the special property that the diamond is very responsive to changes in the external environment at these locations. For example, changes in a magnetic field around a diamond can be detected through careful observation of the spin state of the diamond at the nitrogen vacancy. In addition, observing an ensemble of nitrogen vacancies can enhance the sensitivity of a diamond’s detection potential. However, methods are needed for amplifying the signal generated by a diamond to facilitate the sensing process.\n\nAdvantages: Very sensitive magnetometer with minimal shot-noise. Room temperature sensing. Portable and miniaturizable"
MIT,An Approach to Modeling Social Identity using Dynamic Group Membership for Use in Digital Media Such as Videogames and SocialMedia,Case number: #16989,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/approach-modeling-social-identity-using-dynamic-group,"Chimeria is a novel technology that enables the creation of more nuanced user identities in games, social media and related digital media forms. Its numerous applications in the gaming and media industries include: being used to determine dialogue and options in a computer game based upon the dynamic identity categories of characters in games to improve narrative depth, offering automatic customization of avatars based on their identities as determined by user actions in a game or preferences on social media, and providing recommendation of real/virtual products to gamers and social media users based upon the dynamic identities of their characters and/or profiles.\n\nTechnology: Chimera supports authoring narratives of group membership in any social identity domain through a data-driven approach. It models identities (avatars, characters, profiles, and accounts) in two primary ways: (1) by modeling the underlying structure of social categories and related phenomena with the Chimeria engine, which mathematically models users’ degrees of membership across multiple categories; and (2) by enabling users to build their own creative applications involving social characterization, such as videogames and social media.Important models are those of category membership and naturalization trajectories. In modeling categories, Chimera develops and implements a notion of abstract and concrete categories that can encompass multiple worldviews. To computationally model category gradience, Chimeria computes a closeness value corresponding to the degree to which an actor deviates from a prototypical member of a category, who is defined via a set of features. The degree of membership fluctuates throughout a narrative by actions and choices made by the user. Attributes are added/removed for discrete features (e.g. acquired skillsets) or modified numerically for continuous features (e.g. height), which creates fluctuating degree of membership and naturalization trajectory for the user.\n\nProblem Addressed: Computational modeling of social categories can be found in a wide range of digital media works. In computer role-playing games, racial categorization is often used to visually style a player’s avatar or trigger different canned reactions when conversing with a non-player character. In social media, users can categorize groups based on shared taste or group their acquaintances as “friends,” “family members,” etc. However, in most such systems, category membership is determined in a top-down fashion, with no possibility for hybrid identities, identities that exist at the margins of the groups, or identities that change over time. These deficiencies prevent achieving the nuance of social category membership in the real world. Chimera presents an approach in which a model of social categories can drive customized experiences in games and in social media."
MIT,Development of New Zwitterionic Chemistry  for Ultralow Biofouling of Commercial ROMembranes,Case number: #16765J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/development-new-zwitterionic-chemistry-ultralow,"The invented Zwitterionic coating applied on commercially available RO membranes has enormous potential of providing ultralow biofouling surfaces.\n\nTechnology: The inventors synthesized copolymer films – poly-4 Vinyl pyridine-co-Ethylene glycol diacrylate (p(4VP-co-EGDA)) via iCVD. Post-deposition surface treatment of the copolymner films with 3-bromoproionic Acid (3BPA) produced higher surface zwitterionic contents yielding poly carboxy betains (PCBs). PCBs have been reported to provide surfaces capable of reducing the surface adsorption of non-specific protein to ultralow level. Quaternization is performed on P4VP to obtain a neutral/near-neutral zwitterionic surface that is able to penetrate and degrade cell membranes of various microbes. EDGA is used as the cross linker to render the copolymer insoluble in water yet provide the higher hydrophilicity of the copolymer films. The functionalized (zwitterionic) copolymer film (p(4VP-co-EGDA)) has biocidal moieties (pyridinium ion) coupled with higher hydrophilicity to combat biofouling of the commercially available RO membranes.\n\nProblem Addressed: Other anti-fouling coatings have been applied to various surfaces by processes that involve the use of harsh solvents. These solvents may cause damage to delicate substrate (such as RO membranes), cause unwanted surface tension in the deposited coatings and need additional evaporation processes for complete removal. The invented copolymer chemistry is the first-ever ultralow fouling coating developed by initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD), a solvent-less technique.\n\nAdvantages: Ease of applicability, excellent control and confirmance to surfaces via iCVD technique. Solvent free process unlikely to damage delicate RO membrane. Zwitterionic copolymer film provides ultralow biofouling surface"
MIT,Dihydrogen Tetrametaphosphate: A Potent Precursor to New Organo and Metallo PhosphateSpecies,Case number: #17026,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/dihydrogen-tetrametaphosphate-potent-precursor-new,"Solid-state cyclic phosphate acids have potential applications as precursors for novel organo and metallo cyclic phosphate species. In addition, they also possess phosphorus atoms in the highest oxidation state which confers oxidation resistance and potential to be good catalysts for oxidation reactions.\n\nTechnology: Dihydrogen tetrametaphospate can be prepared by reacting [PPN]4[P4O12]·5H2O with one equivalent of trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA) in acetone at 23 ℃. This reaction, which can be easily carried out at the gram-scale under open-air conditions is capable of producing dyhydrogen tetrametaphospate as an analytically pure solid at 93% yield. Other strong acids, including trifluoroacetic acid, triflic acid, and triflate anhydride can be used as alternatives to TFAA in this reaction scheme.\n\nProblem Addressed: Despite some recent progress in applying cyclic phosphates in materials science and conventional coordination chemistry, their fundamental chemical properties remain poorly understood. One of the reasons for this limited understanding is the dearth of robust precursors to synthesize these compounds. Existing cyclic phosphate precursors have been documented, but the furnace conditions required to synthesize these compounds limited their accessibility. This invention describes a simple preparation method for dihydrogen tetrametaphosphate -- a potent precursor for a wide range of cyclic phosphates -- that can improve its accessibility.\n\nAdvantages: Preparatory reaction for dihydrogen tetrametaphosphate can be easily carried out at the gram-scale under open-air conditions"
MIT,Accurate Indoor Localization With Zero Start-UpCost,Case number: #17027,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/accurate-indoor-localization-zero-start-cost,"This invention has commercial application for industries that require easily deployable tracking or localizing technology for use in complex indoor environments. For example, accurate indoor localization on handheld devices can help companies more readily track tagged and untagged assets in warehouses or department stores.\n\nTechnology: This patented technology enables handheld devices to serve as indoor geo-location systems without requiring special infrastructure or environmental fingerprinting. To achieve this, the invention relies on a new formulation of SAR that allows mobile devices to emulate large antenna arrays and that achieves significantly improved accuracy in indoor RF (radio frequency) localization. This formulation of SAR is translation resistant, which means users can twist their mobile device along unknown paths to perform SAR using today's off-the-shelf Wi-Fi cards and motion sensors.In addition to localizing RF devices, this patented invention combines RF localization with stereo-vision algorithms to localize common objects with no RF source attached to them. This approach for object geotagging using a device's existing camera has important implications for wide-scale adoption of accurate indoor localization techniques using commercially available mobile devices.\n\nAdvantages: Ability to perform Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) on handheld devices. Works on handheld mobile devices already in the pockets of people"
MIT,Gravity Induced Flow Cell Using Suspension-Based FlowElectrodes,Case number: #16747,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/gravity-induced-flow-cell-using-suspension-based-flow,"This technology is applicable to flow batteries and is particularly well-suited for large-scale energy storage applications.\n\nTechnology: This invention replaces the pumps and valves in conventional flow batteries with a rectangular cell that relies on gravity to induce flow.  The entire assembly can be constructed from low cost components using well-established manufacturing techniques, such as injection-molding.  Additionally, the mechanical simplifications made in this invention makes it more reliable than conventional flow batteries, making this design particularly suitable for large-scale applications.The cell contains separate reservoirs for the cathode and anode electrolytes.  When the cell is tilted, the electrolytes flow down the reservoirs, through the electroactive region, and into a second set of reservoirs. The electrolyte flow rate, which also determines the electrical current, is regulated by adjusting the angle of the rectangular cell and the pneumatic pressure within the reservoirs.  Flipping the cell flows the electrolytes in the other direction, allowing multiple passes during charge or discharge and allowing the battery to be cycled.  When the surfaces in contact with the electrolytes are made non-stick, this design minimizes shear strain on the electrolyte so it is suitable for the fully liquid electrolytes used in conventional flow batteries as well as semi-solid suspension electrolytes that have much higher energy densities.\n\nProblem Addressed: Flow batteries typically require expensive and mechanically complex pump systems to control the redox reaction and electrolyte flow.  This technology simplifies flow battery systems by using a gravity-driven design that does not use pumps.  Unlike conventional flow battery systems, this design can accommodate semi-solid as well as fully liquid electrolytes, expanding the number of redox chemistries that can be used in the battery and increasing energy density.\n\nAdvantages: Simplified and higher energy density flow battery design. Can accomodate a wide range of redox chemistries. Low cost and simple manufacturing techniques. Scalable to fit a variety of energy capacities"
MIT,Enhancing Video-Rate Fluorescence Imagery Collected in the Second Near-Infrared Optical Window for Diagnostic Real-Time Surgical and Post-Surgical Applications,Case number: #17022L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/enhancing-video-rate-fluorescence-imagery-collected,"This technology is a fluorescence-based imaging system that has applications in biomedical research and in medicine for intraoperative tumor detection and delineation.\n\nTechnology: This technology enables the intraoperative detection of tumors using both reflectance imaging at the edge of the NIR-I band and fluorescence imaging in the NIR-II band. In this system, the target tissue is irradiated by two NIR light sources emitting light at two different wavelengths - both of which are shorter than 1000 nm. An ordinary LED surgical illuminator can also be used during fluorescence imaging, allowing the surgical team to view the surgical field throughout the entire surgical procedure.The first light source can be an LED which emits around 970nm, where tissue reflectance is high due to the strong water absorption at 960nm. The NIR detector senses the reflected 970nm light and creates a “visible-like” image on the display screen which closely emulates a monochrome visible image. This anatomically co-registers the surgical field with the brightly fluorescing tumors, to facilitate resection, and to give the surgeon the spatial orientation they need when locating small tumors embedded just beneath the tissue surface.The second light source can be an 808 nm diode laser that excites functionalized fluorescent molecules which localize the tumors. These unique fluorescent molecules can be excited by 808nm light and then emit light in the NIR-II spectral band. Both the reflected light and the fluorescent light irradiated from the tissue are captured by a single imaging camera operating in the NIR-II spectral window. Importantly, this single camera can detect both reflected light and fluorescent NIR light. Since the intensities of both NIR light sources can be adjusted independently of each other, the users can select a “visible-like” tissue view, a sharp tumor-only view, or a blended combination of both views which provides excellent tumor registration together with an adjustable level of tissue imaging. This allows the surgeon to quickly locate and resect each tumor in turn. Flashing the 808nm NIR source means only the fluorescing tumors themselves “flash,” making even pinhead-sized tumors or sub-surface tumors clearly noticeable within the visible-like context image.  The NIR camera is only sensitive to light with wavelengths greater than ~950 nm, which minimizes the effect of daylight and ambient room light - especially with modern high-efficiency LED lamps.\n\nProblem Addressed: Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence-based imaging has the potential to detect tumors with high sensitivity and high specificity in real time. Current approaches employ fluorescent dyes and operate mostly in the first NIR window (NIR-I, 700 - 900 nm) for image-guided use. To image tissue, visible light and fluorescence images are either taken with the same detector or with multiple cameras in different spectral ranges simultaneously or sequentially. Systems that can detect both visible and fluorescent imaging simultaneously use silicon-based detectors that are sensitive to visible and NIR-I spectral bands. However, to properly separate these narrowly-spaced passbands, expensive spectral filters with narrow fields-of-view are required. Other systems which instead use multiple cameras to detect visible light, NIR-I, and/or the second NIR window (NIR-II, 1000 - 1700 nm), must fuse the images from all these detectors to create the combined image via post processing. This image fusion requires precise optical alignment and positioning, which ultimately increases the size, weight, and cost of the imaging system. This fluorescence-based imaging technology overcomes the limitations of these two approaches. Moreover, NIR-II imaging technology can offer better tissue penetration, reduced light scattering, and lower tissue autofluorescence.The present invention is an improved method for image acquisition in both the NIR-I and NIR-II spectral windows using a single image detection system.  It is also compatible with nearly all LED surgical illuminators.\n\nAdvantages: Achieves intraoperative fluorescence imaging of tumors. One camera performs fluorescence and reflective “visible-like” imaging with perfect image registration. Does not require costly spectral filters"
MIT,Diminished Proteolytic Shedding of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases Mediates MEK Inhibitor Resistance in Triple-Negative BreastCancer,Case number: #16742,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/diminished-proteolytic-shedding-receptor-tyrosine,"This invention diagnoses kinase inhibitor resistant cancer and also decreases resistance to kinase inhibitors for improved cancer treatments.\n\nTechnology: This technology is based on the discovery that decreased proteolytic shedding of surface receptors, which provide negative feedback on signaling network activity thereby driving post-translational “bypass” signaling pathways, can be caused by anti-cancer kinase inhibitor treatments leading to resistance to those very same therapeutics. Inhibition of multiple signaling pathways, in particular MAPK signaling through MEK1/2, drives “bypass” signaling by causing diminished A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase (ADAM)-mediated receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) shedding including MET, HER2, HER4, and especially AXL RTKs. Targeted MEK inhibition (MEKi) has been identified as a promising therapeutic strategy since RAF/MEK /ERK mitogenic phospho-signaling is up-regulated in many cancers including TNBC.  MEK, BRAF, p38, JNK and PI3K kinase inhibition have been shown to reduce RTK shedding and hence gives rise to the bypass signaling. This technology increases sensitivity of cancers under treatment with kinase inhibitors by blocking the bypass signaling pathways of RTKs and/or by encouraging RTK receptor shedding.\n\nProblem Addressed: Molecular-targeted cancer therapeutics eventually fail due to cancer’s ability to become resistant to drugs. How carcinogenic cells achieve this resistance is poorly understood, with genetic and gene expression changes accounting for only a small percentage of their adaptability. This invention is a method to reduce cancer’s resistance to anti-cancer therapeutics, and may be used for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), melanoma, ovarian cancer, and other indications where MAPK pathway activation is prominent. The invention may also be used to aid in selecting patients for targeted combination therapies and in monitoring patients for treatment response and mechanisms of drug resistance.\n\nAdvantages: May be used in conjunction with kinase inhibitor cancer treatments to decrease resistance. May be used to identify patients likely to respond to kinase inhibitor treatments and combinations thereof"
MIT,Methods for Versatile Nanoparticle-ProteinConjugation,Case number: #16763,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/methods-versatile-nanoparticle-protein-conjugation,"The rapid, reliable conjugation of nanoparticles (e.g., semiconductor nanocrystals, quantum dots, nanorods) to biomolecules (e.g., proteins, DNA) is of use in nanoelectronic and nanophotonic devices. Additional applications exist in the generation of fluorescent bioprobes, engineered biosensors, and therapeutic agents.\n\nTechnology: Here we describe the production of conjugates between nanoparticles (e.g., semiconductor nanocrystals, quantum dots, nanorods) and biological molecules (e.g., proteins, DNA). In order to generate the conjugates, two separate E.coli constructs are produced. The first E. coli strain generates proteins (e.g., SpyCatcher, Pilin-C) that bind to the surface of nanocrystal shells via cysteine and histidine linkages to form stable, fluorescent nanocrystal-protein conjugates. The second E. coli strain expresses tagged (e.g., SpyTag, isopeptag) amyloid fibrils on its surface. The complementary components of the linkage protein systems (i.e., SpyTag-SpyCatcher; Pilin-C-isopeptag) bind irreversibly when mixed. As such, mixing the two E. coli strains produces conjugates of the fluorescent nanoparticle-protein complex and the tagged amyloid fibril via these molecular linkage proteins. The conjugates can be patterned into higher-order structures by manipulating the expression of the self-assembling amyloid fibrils. The organized, single-step self-assembly of chains of nanoparticles at the micron scale has the potential to expand the applications and potentials of nanoelectronic and nanophotonic devices\n\nProblem Addressed: Existing methods for producing conjugates of nanoparticles and biological molecules (e.g., carbodiimide crosslinker chemistry) are largely inefficient, non-specific, and require multiple steps. This single-step synthetic route uses engineered E. coli to produce molecular linkages that self-assemble to reliably form micron-scale chains of nanoparticle-biomolecule conjugates. The bonds are formed within minutes and are highly specific and stable.\n\nAdvantages: Single step synthesis. Highly stable conjugates. Can be used with a variety of semi-conductor materialsRapid (< 30 minutes) self-assembly of conjugates. High binding specificity"
MIT,Integrated Electrical Profiling System for Measuring Leukocytes Activation from WholeBlood,Case number: #16736,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/integrated-electrical-profiling-system-measuring,"This tool can be used for sepsis detection and diagnosis in a hospital setting, asa prognostic indicator of an autoimmune episode or neutropenia, and as a point of care monitoring system.\n\nTechnology: Professors Jay Han and Joel Voldman have developed a technology to address this issue.  Their novel detection system allows for isolation and quantification of activated neutrophils, which have been established as a biomarker of sepsis.  Requiring only a small sample volume and a relatively rapid assay time, this device can be used to monitor the onset and progression of sepsis in a sensitive and specific manner.  Moreover, this system can be adapted to monitor a range of conditions associated with elevated levels of inflammation, such as autoimmune diseases, and in both clinical and non-clinical settings.\n\nProblem Addressed: Sepsis is a condition characterized by uncontrolled inflammation resulting from a microbial infection, most often in a hospital setting.  In the United States, close to one million incidences of sepsis occur yearly, with a morbidity of 40-60%, incurring an estimated $400 million in treatment costs.  Early and accurate diagnosis of the condition is essential for effective treatment, and current diagnosis options are limited.\n\nAdvantages: Small sample volume. Rapid assay time. High sensitivity and specificity. Label free. Can be performed in an outpatient setting"
MIT,Load Variation Detection and Compensation in Device-to-Device WirelessCharging,Case number: #16727,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/load-variation-detection-and-compensation-device,"Wireless device-to-device charging for portable devices, including wearables or medical implants\n\nTechnology: The invention is a phone-to-portable wireless charging system with transmitter-side circuitry that detects and dynamically compensates for load variation to maintain high efficiency and regulate power levels.\n\nProblem Addressed: Device-to-device wireless charging for portables suffers from variation of coupling between the transmitter and receiver due to the relative motion of these devices, which reduces efficiency. Current wireless charging technologies utilize stationary devices positioned relative to a receiver. Current technology that exists to adapt to a time-varying load has drawbacks including reduced efficiency, increased cost, and increased EMI.\n\nAdvantages: Dynamically adjusts to load, thereby maintaining efficient power transmission. Responds efficiently to both increases and decreases in measured load. Compensates for changes in load through adjusting transmitter-side components instead of adjusting the load, reducing the cost of receiver components, and instead of adjusting the frequency or duty cycle, reducing the EMI."
MIT,Lithium-Ion FiberBattery,Case number: #16676,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/lithium-ion-fiber-battery,"This technology provides a method to create porous thermally drawn fibers that can be used for flexible lithium ion batteries or be adapted for drug delivery, filtration and chemical synthesis applications.\n\nTechnology: The porous fiber starts as a preform containing a hollow region that is filled with a solution.  During drawing, temperature is maintained so that the solution remains fully liquid.  After drawing, the fiber cools to below the phase-separation temperature of the solution.  This causes the solution to separate into solid and liquid regions, creating liquid-filled pores along the fiber length.  If desired, the liquid can be drained from the pores and optionally replaced with another material.  The liquid-filled porous structure can serve as the electrolyte for a battery.  Other battery components (such as the current collector, anode and cathode) can be included in the preform so the drawn fiber becomes a fully functional, flexible battery.  Alternatively, the fiber can be configured for filtration or chemical synthesis.\n\nProblem Addressed: Preform based drawn fibers are typically limited to uniform structures along the length of the fiber.  This technology allows pores to be introduced into the fiber, making the preform drawing method suitable to a wider range of applications, including flexible lithium ion batteries, drug delivery, and filtration.\n\nAdvantages: Low cost and easy to scale up for commercial production. Easily configured for a wide variety of needs, including flexible lithium ion batteries"
MIT,Percolated Microstructures for Multi-Modal Transport Enhancement in Porous ActiveMaterials,Case number: #16705,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/percolated-microstructures-multi-modal-transport,"The technology increases transport in active materials concurrently for two different modes, such as vapor and heat transport for adsorption heat pumps or electron and ion transport in battery electrodes.\n\nTechnology: Microporous fins of carbon paper, carbon cloth, and porous metal can be incorporated into compressed zeolite 13x adsorbent material, improving both the bulk vapor transport and heat transport. The fins can be inserted and pressed vertically or horizontally into a fin-tube stack, and separate fins can extend both through and around the fin tube stack. The fins can be filled with a semi-rigid resin that helps maintain pore structure during densification. The resin is then removed with a solvent, leaving open channels for vapor or ion transport. This percolated graphene network increases maximum packing density of porous active material and heat and mass transport. This technique can be applied to other multi-modal transport systems to and from active materials.\n\nProblem Addressed: For many engineered systems transport must occur concurrently for two different modes. Current methods add a low-volume non-active material to increase one mode and hinder the other as little as possible. However, these methods cannot increase both modes and reduce the overall active material density due to the added fraction of non-active material. The proposed method increases both modes of transport with a low additive fraction binder.\n\nAdvantages: Decoupling of modes of transport (e.g., heat and vapor, electron and ion). Increases maximum packing density"
MIT,NMR Based Device for Fluid StatusMonitoring,Case number: #16497,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/nmr-based-device-fluid-status-monitoring,"Portable hydration sensor\n\nTechnology: This invention presents a novel method for non-invasively measuring physiological hydration state using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).  This technology utilizes 1H NMR, which measures the relaxivity of hydrogen in water.  Using NMR relaxivity component analysis and signal-processing methods, the amount of water in different tissue targets (e.g. intracellular, extracellular, interstitial, intravascular) can be determined.  This invention marks the first time applying NMR measurement to physiological hydration state.Vascularization varies in different anatomical locations and tissues of the body.  Signals from the vasculature can be detected by increasing the measurement volume and focusing on a region with reduced blood velocity where excited protons do not exit the field of measurement quickly. While not limited to a single tissue type, fingers contain dense capillary beds with relatively small amounts of muscle mass and are particularly convenient.  Simple spin-spin relaxation (T2) measurements of the fingers correlate with the hydration state of a human and appear to be equivalent to clinically accepted yet more invasive assessments.  This novel finger NMR unit is small (please refer to the figures), making it easy for a patient to comfortably place a finger in the field of measurement.\n\nProblem Addressed: Hydration imbalance, either dehydration or over-hydration (hyponatremia), affects cognitive and physical abilities, negatively impacting cardiovascular function, compromising thermoregulation, and decreasing exercise performance.  Hydration imbalance is a critical, life-threatening problem that affects over 1.2 million people annually and represents over $44.7 billion in healthcare costs.  Dehydration is preventable and reversible, and hospitalization from fluid imbalance is preventable through monitoring and early intervention.  Though various tools and metrics exist to measure hydration state, such as body mass change, capillary refill time, plasma osmolality, and bioimpedance, there is no hydration assessment method that is fast, portable, accurate, non-invasive, and designed for outpatient settings.\n\nAdvantages: Portable, inexpensive, easy, fast, and reliable hydration sensor. Potential to greatly reduce hospital spending on hydration imbalance"
MIT,Waveguide Formation Using the Patterned Shallow Trench Isolation of a Bulk-CMOS Die or Wafer through Post-FoundryProcessing,Case number: #16489,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/waveguide-formation-using-patterned-shallow-trench,"Technology applications:     \n\nCommunication transceivers\nApplication specific integrated circuits requiring electronic-photonic integration\nIntegrated quantum optics\nIntegrated photonic biosensing\nOptical I/O\n\nTechnology: The invention utilizes shallow trench isolation features patterned during in-foundry processing for subsequent waveguide formation via a post-process dielectric deposition. This is accomplished after etching the silicon on the back side of the wafer and then exposing the photonic integration region, where the desired photonic waveguide core dielectric layer is uniformly deposited, and finally depositing a lower cladding dielectric layer on the waveguide cores. This process is entirely CMOS compatible and utilizes standard patterning and etching techniques.\n\nProblem Addressed: Optical I/O resolves one of the major bottlenecks in inter and intra chip communications. However, creating waveguides for photonic-electronic devices in bulk semiconductor manufacturing process requires complicated post-processing and high-resolution lithography, which is very costly. Alternatively, back-end integrated waveguides are physically distant from the transistor body layer, making integration with silicon photodetectors, etc., difficult. Deposited dielectric layers also reduce the thermal conductance of the entire chip, reducing allowable power dissipation and hindering performance.\n\nAdvantages: Low-loss, high patterning resolution waveguide within electronics process utilizing bulk starting wafers. Waveguide in-plane with transistor body layer allows coupling to other electronic/photonic devices. Standard CMOS process flowImproved waveguide integration for wavelengths covering 400nm – 1150 nm with arbitrary dielectrics. Reduced dielectric covering of die or wafer, which increases total allowable power dissipation"
MIT,PlantNanobionics,Case number: #16515,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/plant-nanobionics,"This technology has applications in sensing damaging agents, enhancing photosynthesis, and monitoring organism behavior in plants.\n\nTechnology: Professor Michael Strano and colleagues have developed a new approach, termed plant nanobionics, for broadening the potential for plant function. This technology describes an engineered system in which plants are infused with one of several categories of nanostructures, with the purpose of enhancing photosynthesis, increasing stability against damage from reactive oxygen species, and sensing the presence of herbicides, pesticides, and pollutants in the environment. These nanostructures are either single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) encapsulated by single-stranded DNA; polyacrylic acid nanoceria, a known anti-oxidant; or a conjugate of both.  The nanostructures can be delivered in a non-toxic and non-destructive manner through the leaf lamina, and their sensing capabilities are measured via shifts in their near-IR fluorescence signal.\n\nProblem Addressed: The possibility of engineering plant tissues for enhancing photosynthesis and monitoring the environment has been largely unexplored.   Plants  that harvest sunlight more efficiently would be highly advantageous when cultivated as sources of alternative energy.  Additionally, sensitively determining plant and soil health can prove important for maximizing agricultural yields and preventing damage from environmental factors, pollution, and pesticides.   However, developing sufficiently sensitive tools for this purpose is challenging, largely due to the complex microenvironments found in plant tissues.\n\nAdvantages: Non-toxic. Easily multiplexed and delivered to plant tissue. Highly specific and sensitive with low background"
MIT,An ASIC with Column-Row-ParallelArchitecture,Case number: #16440,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/asic-column-row-parallel-architecture,"This technology can be used for three-dimensional and four-dimensional ultrasound imaging, particularly in the field of medicine.\n\nTechnology: This technology makes a circuit-level column-row-parallel architecture of multiple ultrasonic transceivers to form a grid. A variety of aperture configurations is achieved through selective beam-forming including plane-wave coherent computing, checkerboard patterns, and annular rings. The flexibility in 3D beam formation allows fine granularity in imaging based on organ-specific requirements. Miniaturization into an integrated circuit is possible by using capacitive micro-machined ultrasonic transducers or piezoelectric micro-machined ultrasonic transducers.\n\nProblem Addressed: Two-dimensional medical ultrasound produces outlines and flat images of the internal body organs. While this is advantageous for diagnosing prenatal heart defects, kidney problems, and other internal organ abnormalities, a three-dimensional ultrasound image shows external features, anatomical details of the body organ, and volumetric view of the soft tissues. Stitching images of the three-dimensional ultrasound relative to time results in the real-time visualization of the organ functionality. However, making a three-dimensional ultrasound probe is expensive and complex.\n\nAdvantages: Miniaturized. Scalable. Flexible. Fault-tolerant. Programmable beam-formation"
MIT,Methods for Treating Polycystic KidneyDisease,Case number: #16389J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/methods-treating-polycystic-kidney-disease,"This technology comprises a class of compounds, denoted 11β, and associated methods useful for the treatment of Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) by modulating the sensitivity to oxidative stress of the target cells.\n\nTechnology: Inducing apoptosis by oxidative stress is a known mechanism for several compounds with clinical relevance. Cells lacking both copies of PKD genes (i.e., the cystic cells of PKD) are characterized by mitochondrial abnormalities that reduce their ability to respond to oxidative stress. In two distinct PKD1 conditional knockout mouse model, exposure to 11β increases oxidative stress in the cystic cells, leading to the destruction of the target cells via apoptosis while normal kidney cells remain unaffected. In these mouse models of PKD, treatment with 11β dramatically slows down the course of the disease and restores kidney size and function back to normal levels. The 11β class of molecules constitutes an effective small-molecule therapeutic for PKD, by selectively destroying the cyst-forming cells.\n\nProblem Addressed: PKD is among the most common life-threatening monogenic inherited diseases in the world.  It is a leading cause of end-stage renal failure and a common indication for dialysis or renal transplantation. Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapeutic drugs available that directly target PKD. Clinical strategies (e.g., mTOR inhibitors) that have focused on slowing the growth of cystic cells have been largely ineffective. Through a different mechanism of action, in the cellular respiration pathway, the 11β molecules target affected cells with high specificity.  The inventors of this technology demonstrate that administration of 11β compounds to mouse models of PKD results in a significant reduction of kidney cyst formation, restoration of kidney size, and kidney function with no significant adverse toxic or metabolic effects.  The inventors note that the activity of the compounds in a PKD animal model is substantially better than other reference compounds in the literature.\n\nAdvantages: Selectively targets the cyst-forming cells in PKDExposure to 11β molecules shows no significant adverse toxic or metabolic effects in unaffected organs. Administration of 11β compounds to mice demonstrates the therapeutic benefits of the compounds such as regression in cyst size and number,  and restoration of the kidney function in vivo. The mechanism of 11β molecules (i.e., targeted killing of cystic cells) suggests a possible intermittent clinical regimen (e.g., patients take the drug only a few weeks at a time, followed by recovery periods), which will greatly benefit patient compliance and quality of life. This is a huge advantage over a drug like Tolvaptan, which has to be administered continuously"
MIT,Continuous Fabrication Platform for Highly Aligned PolymerFilms,Case number: #17065,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/continuous-fabrication-platform-highly-aligned,"This technology can fabricate highly aligned polymer films that are meters long. These films can be used in heat transfer applications such as electronic packaging and heat exchangers or can become structural components with lamination. This process is also compatible with polymer-based composites, which allows filler materials (e.g., carbon nanotubes or graphene) that can further enhance the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of the resulting material.\n\nTechnology: This fabrication process consists of three steps; sol-gel extrusion, structure freezing and drying, and a mechanical drawing process. The first step involves subjecting the polymer-solvent solution to a high shear, high temperature, Couette flow extrusion into a thin film, resulting in initial disentanglement. Next, the extruded film is frozen using a liquid nitrogen cooled substrate. During this step, the solvent is removed from the polymer gel through ambient evaporation. Finally the dried film is mechanically drawn in a heated enclosure using a constant-force adaptive-thickness drawing system. The performance of this system has been confirmed by creating highly aligned polyethylene films meters long with draw ratios exceeding 100x and high crystallinity and orientation.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current fabrication methods for highly aligned polymer films (HAPFs) are limited to manual, lab-scale batch processes. This process is an automated fabrication platform, the size of a printer, that can produce high crystallinity and orientation polyethylene films with draw ratios exceeding 100x.\n\nAdvantages: Allows large-scale HAPF fabrication. Compatible with polymer-based composites"
MIT,Pulse Detection from Head Motions inVideo,Case number: #16417,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/pulse-detection-head-motions-video,"The Inventors exploit subtle head oscillations that accompany the cardiac cycle to extract information about cardiac activity from videos. This method provides an unobtrusive way of measuring heart rate and can be used to extract other clinically useful information about cardiac activity, such as the subtle changes in the length of heart-beats that are associated with the health of the autonomic nervous system.\n\nTechnology: The cyclical movement of blood from the heart to the head via the abdominal aorta and the carotid arteries causes the head to move in a periodic motion. The Inventors’ algorithm detects pulse from this movement. This method takes an input video of a person’s head and returns a pulse rate as well as a series of beat locations which can be used for the analysis of beat-to-beat variability. The motion of the head is extracted using feature tracking, upon which the motion corresponding to the pulse is isolated and projected onto a 1D signal to extract individual beat boundaries from the peaks of the trajectory. For this, principal component analysis (PCA) is used and the component whose temporal power spectrum best matches a pulse is selected.The algorithm projects the trajectories of feature points onto this component and extracts the beat locations as local extrema. The correct source for analyzing and computing the duration of individual beats is chosen by examining the frequency spectra and selecting the source with the clearest main frequency. Average pulse rate is identified using this frequency. For more fine-grained analysis and calculation of beat durations, peak detections are performed in the time domain.\n\nProblem Addressed: Heart rate is a critical vital sign for medical diagnosis. There is a growing interest in extracting it without contact, particularly for populations such as premature neonates and the elderly who have fragile skin that may be damaged by traditional sensors. Furthermore, as the population ages, frequent monitoring outside of clinical environments can provide doctors with not just timely samples but also long-term trends and statistical analyses. This continuous monitoring requires a non-obtrusive technology. The Inventors have developed one such method of non-invasive heart monitoring by detecting pulse from head motions in video.\n\nAdvantages: Non-invasive, non-obtrusive method for continuous heart monitoring. Can be used as a diagnosis tool for patients for whom traditional heart monitoring methods might be risky, including premature neonates and the elderly"
MIT,"Ingestible Physiological Status Monitoring (PSM) Device (the ""PSMPill"")",Case number: #16636LJ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/ingestible-physiological-status-monitoring-psm-device,"This invention provides real-time internal monitoring of vital signs with improved accuracy over external measurements, useful for field assessment of patients or home monitoring and management of chronic illnesses. This device may also be used for operational safety monitoring for military personnel or first responders, or to improve performance and safety for athletes. This device can detect a number of medical conditions including, sepsis, arrhythmias, aortic stenosis, hypertrophy, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations.\n\nTechnology: This small ingestible PSM device enters the digestive tract as a pill and contains a thermistor to measure temperature and an electret hydrophone and processing circuitry to collect, amplify, and filter audio signals to derive heart and breathing rates from noisy data. The data is wirelessly transmitted to a receiver outside the patient. This device can collect data anywhere along the digestive tract regardless of contact with tissue. The PSM device can be either transient and excreted normally, or persistent and affixed in the digestive tract. The PSM device has a relatively long battery life of at least 4 days, but persistent devices may be powered through inductively coupled or wireless resonant recharging.\n\nProblem Addressed: Physiological status monitoring (PSM) systems can provide data for necessary preventative interventions, improved performance, risk mitigation, or monitoring of illness or after injury. Current PSM devices are less than ideal due to a number of limitations including limited battery life, poor signal fidelity, and general ergonomic obtrusiveness. This invention is an ingestible, minimally intrusive PSM device that measures heart rate, breathing rate, and core temperature for reliable and rapid monitoring of physiological status.\n\nAdvantages: Inexpensive. Extended battery life with optional recharging capabilities. Operational anywhere in the GI tract and can be transient or persistent. Improved patient comfort. Measures true core temperature which isn’t currently obtainable except with rectal thermometry"
MIT,Use of Gel Pads or Particles with Oil Isolation to Create Small ReactionVolumes,Case number: #16388,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/use-gel-pads-or-particles-oil-isolation-create-small,"This technology has applications in ultrasensitive biomolecule sensing, single cell assays, integrated lab on chip for point of care testing, and enhanced live cell imaging.\n\nTechnology: Professor Pat Doyle and colleagues have developed a method involving isolated, aqueous containers formed from miniaturized hydrogels, which addresses many of the limitations of conventional microfluidics approaches. These hydrogels can take on two forms: gel cylinders attached to glass slides or microchannels; and individual gel particles.  These gels have many advantages, including straightforward fabrication, tunable chemistry and mesh size, hydrophilicity and insolubility in water.  Using these hydrogels allows for ultrasensitive biomolecule detection and enables new characterization of biological systems.  These unique hydrogels also possess the ability to concentrate reaction products, capture cell secreted analytes without allowing contaminants to penetrate their pores, and easily multiplex several analytes, avoiding the complex workflows with complicated microfluidic chip design and fabrication.\n\nProblem Addressed: Conventional biological assays are often characterized by long incubation times, high reagent costs, and labor-intensive protocols.  Miniaturizing these assays using microfluidics solves many of these issues; smaller sample volumes increase reaction rates and decrease quantities of necessary reagents, and microfluidic arrays are often amenable to automation to increase throughput.  However, complex fabrication of many microfluidic systems reduces their usefulness in many situations.\n\nAdvantages: Tunable properties. Supports multiplexed reagents. Reaction volume on femtoliter to picoliter scale. High resolution readout"
MIT,A Remote Means of Creating and Controlling Directed Photoacoustic Energy Within the HumanBody,Case number: #16423L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/remote-means-creating-and-controlling-directed,"This non-contact laser ultrasound system (NCLUS) generates ultrasound images without making physical contact with the patient. It is an improvement upon current ultrasound applications in the medical setting such as bone imaging, traumatic brain injury detection, surgical guidance, internal bleeding detection, and bone health imaging. NCLUS is compact and lightweight, making it useful in field settings such as during combat or patient evacuation transport. The non-contact feature of the NCLUS makes it attractive for situations in which standard contact ultrasound systems would cause contamination or discomfort. For example, this system may be used to image injured body regions, open wounds during surgery, and in delicate procedures such as those involving the eye.\n\nTechnology: The NCLUS system utilizes photoacoustics to create a directed source of acoustic energy within the body. To accomplish this, it uses a pulsed near infrared source (Q-switched laser) to scan ultrasonic elastic waves at the speed of sound along a surface of the body. By moving the source of ultrasonic elastic waves at the speed of the propagating acoustic wave, the system creates a coherent directional wavefront to probe structures within the patient. The directionality of the NCLUS produces higher quality spatial information, reducing the distortion observed with contact sensing deformation. It also provides an amplitude that is significantly larger than that of current omni-directional techniques. This results in a penetration depth of a few inches rather than a few centimeters.The elastic waves propagate into the body and reflect back to the skin surface, where they are measured using laser Doppler vibrometry developed specifically for the NCLUS. These measurements can be processed to form an image of the interior body based on elastic wave impedance contrast.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current ultrasound imaging systems rely on mechanical transducers and receivers in contact with the skin where coupling gels act as an interface to reduce the impedance between the device and the skin. They produce images with inconsistent resolution due to the variability in operator hand pressure. The NCLUS limits operator variability by using non-contact ultrasound techniques to produce high resolution images.Additionally, current ultrasound imaging systems produce images by delivering photoacoustic energy in an omni-directional fashion. This yields two-dimensional images that suffer from a lack in resolution, and have a penetration depth of centimeters. The NCLUS delivers a very strong near surface wave propagating in a single direction along the surface of the patient. This allows for three-dimensional imaging, improved resolution, and a penetration depth of inches.\n\nAdvantages: Non-contactLimits operator variability in hand pressure. Better and more consistent image resolution3D spatial imaging. Deeper imaging penetration depth of inches rather than centimeters. Safe for use on eyes and sensitive skin. Compact and lightweight, therefore useful in field settings"
MIT,Internally-Heated Thermal and Externally-Cool Photovoltaic Cascade Solar System For The Full Solar SpectrumUtilization,Case number: #16542,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/internally-heated-thermal-and-externally-cool,"A stacked solar receiver system combining internally-heated thermal and externally-cooled photovoltaic cell components would be applicable in a variety of concentrating solar power (CSP) trough plants.\n\nTechnology: This invention incorporates a PV cell and an aerogel-based spectrally-selective thermal absorber/transmitter into a traditional CSP setup. These components are organized in a stacked configuration. This enables the same concentrating optical components to be used for both solar thermal and PV systems, thus reducing the complexity and overall cost of the converter. At an optical concentration of 50 suns and a working fluid temperature of 375°C, the entire system can achieve exergetic efficiencies as high as 70%. At this efficiency, 60% of the exergy is dispatchable heat and 40% is chemical energy stored in the PV cell. When this system is incorporated into a large-scale CSP trough plant, the anticipated price estimate would be lower than 1$/Watt. The layers are ordered as follows: an upper layer of optically transparent and thermally insulating (OTTI) aerogel, a spectrally-selective thermal absorber that heats the CSP working fluid, a lower layer of OTTI aerogel, and a PV cell at the bottom. Solar energy passes through the upper OTTI aerogel layer and into the thermal absorber, which absorbs ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) radiation above and below the PV cell bandgap. The photon energy collected from these frequencies heats the working fluid, which is sandwiched between the UV and IR absorber materials. Photon energy transmitted through this band-pass filter travels through the lower layer of OTTI aerogel and is collected by the PV cell at the bottom. The upper and lower layers of OTTI aerogel suppress radiative thermal losses and insulate the hot region surrounding the working fluid. They also keep the environment surrounding the PV cell near ambient temperature. Aerogel insulation also eliminates the need for traditional vacuum gap insulation, which can extend the lifespan of a CSP trough plant to beyond 25 years. The thermal absorber, comprised of aerogel doped with spectrally-selective nanoparticles, maximizes the efficiency of the PV cell and reduces the cooling required to keep the PV cell at an ambient temperature.\n\nProblem Addressed: Solar power is currently captured by either photovoltaic (PV) cells, which are relatively efficient, or CSP driven heat engines, which have greater dispatchability and, as a result, the potential to replace traditional base load power sources. Introducing an additional PV cell component to a traditional CSP system would greatly increase exergy output with only a small increase in manufacturing and assembly costs.\n\nAdvantages: Low complexity and easy incorporation into pre-existing CSP systems. Highly dispatchable power generation. High exergetic efficiency (70%) and low cost of power (<1$/W). Reduction of radiative thermal losses and cooling for PV cell. Increased lifespan of CSP trough plants"
MIT,Novel Thermal Desalination Structures With and Without Thermal VaporCompression,Case number: #16554J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/novel-thermal-desalination-structures-and-without,"Applications for this technology are found in chemical engineering, industrial water treatment, and power.\n\nTechnology: A methodology is proposed to identify improved thermal‐based desalination structures. It is based on the notion of superstructure, allowing for the simultaneous representation of numerous feed, brine and vapor routing schemes. By adjusting the flow routings, the superstructure is capable of representing the common thermal desalination structures, as well as an extremely large number of alternate structures, some of which might exhibit advantageous behavior. The superstructure is built around a repeating unit which is a generalization of an effect in a multi‐effect distillation system (MED) and a stage in a multi‐stage flash system (MSF).The superstructure is proposed as an improved tool for the structural optimization of thermal desalination systems, whereby the optimal selection of components making up the final system, the optimal routing of the vapors as well as the optimal operating conditions are all variables simultaneously determined during the optimization problem. The proposed methodology is applicable to both stand‐alone desalination plants and dual‐purpose (water and power) plants wherein the heat source to the desalination plant is fixed. It can be extended to also consider hybrid thermal‐mechanical desalination structures, as well as dual‐purpose plants where the interface of power cycle and desalination is also optimized for.Moreover, the optimal location of vapor extraction is heavily dependent on the exact distillate production requirement in question. Two novel configuration forms are informed by the optimization. The first is an integrated MED–TVC + MED + MSF system, while the second is an integrated MED–TVC + MSF system.\n\nProblem Addressed: The global demand for a steady economical supply of fresh water continues to increase. One of the main known modes of increasing the existing water supply is seawater desalination: a proven process that can reliably convert the seemingly limitless supply of seawater to high quality water suitable for human consumption. Thermal desalination techniques rely on alternating evaporation and condensation of water. These techniques are robust and reliable but have little potential for further improvements. This technology offers a tool for the optimized design and thus improvement of the thermal desalination systems.\n\nAdvantages: New desalination structures identified. The invented structures produce larger amounts of distillate from a fixed heat input system. Lower heat transfer requirements needed"
MIT,Engineering DNA Assembly in Vivo and Knock Down of Gene Expression Using the Reverse TranscriptaseActivity,Case number: #16593,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/engineering-dna-assembly-vivo-and-knock-down-gene,"This invention produces oligonucleotides for the self-assembly of DNA nanostructures for a variety of uses.\n\nTechnology: A synthetic pathway was developed in E. coli to perform reverse transcription. Reverse transcriptase and a functional template, a conjugate of a eukaryotic t-RNALys with a non­coding targeted RNA, are expressed in the cell.  The functional template serves as a reconstituted replacement for a fundamental missing element in the activation of a reverse transcriptase, such as the HIV reverse transcriptase, process in bacteria. This strategy produces oligonucleotides, which optionally may be further manipulated to cause nucleic acid single strand cross­over assembly for the formation of various DNA nanostructures. Additional internal and/or external stimuli can fine tune the in vivo synthesis of ssDNAs resulting in the dynamic control of the nanostructure shape and/or size and/or constitution. Once the ssDNA oligonucleotide is produced in the cell it may be used in the cell or isolated from the cell for therapeutic applications.\n\nProblem Addressed: Functional DNA nanostructures have a number of applications, including, but not limited to, scaffolds for the organization of materials, synthesis of organic elements, control of biomineralization, drug delivery, and intracellular sensors.  In vivo implementation has been largely limited as it is costly to generate such elements and current method’s DNA assembly information remains outside of the genetic record of the cell causing it to lose structural information upon division. Further, it remains difficult to build structures using long single stranded DNA (ssDNA). This invention is a method to develop genetic circuits for the self-assembly of nanostructures in vivo using reverse transcription to produce ssDNA. This technology has already been demonstrated through engineering E. coli to reverse transcribe ssDNA for the successful knockdown of genes.\n\nAdvantages: Self-assembly of different DNA nanostructures in vivo. Control of shape/size/constitution"
MIT,Broadband and Ultrahigh Resolution Spectrometer Based on a MultimodeWaveguide,Case number: #16610,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/broadband-and-ultrahigh-resolution-spectrometer-based,"This invention is used in analytical chemistry, biochemical sensing, material analysis, optical communication, and medical applications.\n\nTechnology: The invention is a monolithic, compact spectrometer based on multimode interference (MMI) and can simultaneously achieve high resolving power and bandwidth in a simple-to-couple and compact device. It matches the performance of large grating spectrometers using modal interference in a multimode waveguide with an area of a few square millimeters or less. These kinds of MMI spectrometers could be used in applications requiring broadband operation and high-resolution spectroscopic analysis.\n\nProblem Addressed: Developing miniature spectrometers require sacrificing the high spectral resolution and broad operating range possible in large grating spectrometers. Therefore, there is a need to develop compact spectrometers with high resolution and broad operating range.\n\nAdvantages: Wider operating range than other millimeter scale spectrometersIt offers both high resolving power and fractional bandwidth within a compact device. Comparative performance with large grating spectrometers"
MIT,Localized SolarCollectors,Case number: #16537,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/localized-solar-collectors,"Harvesting solar energy for heating/phase change of water.\n\nTechnology: This invention relates to the development of three novel structures to harvest solar energy for heating/phase change of water. These structures concentrate the solar energy where it is needed and consequently minimize the dissipated thermal energy.One of these structures is the double layer structure (DLS), which consists of an insulating carbon foam supporting a layer of expanded graphite. The insulating nature of DLS provide a hot spot inside the structure and the hydrophilic nature of the DLS promotes water flow through the capillaries into the hot spot for evaporation.The second set of structures localizes the solar energy internally for solar heating. This structure consists of a layer of expanded graphite sandwiched between two layers of silica aerogel. The hot region induced in the expanded graphite layer is intended for solar heating. The low surface temperature of the top silica aerogel layer minimizes the energy dissipation by convection and radiation. The thermal efficiency of this system can reach close to 100% by proper design of aerogel layers.The third set of structures, a hydrophobic absorbing structure, promotes the nucleation of the vapor phase throughout the liquid volume, which significantly enhances the rate of boiling. The threshold concentration of solar energy required for local phase-change is reduced drastically.\n\nProblem Addressed: Localization of solar energy is a promising approach for harvesting solar energy for the heating/phase change of water. However, one of the biggest challenges for further development of this approach is low efficiency of localization. This invention relates to three novel structures that increase efficiency of localization of solar energy.\n\nAdvantages: Increased localization efficiency of heat capture"
MIT,Electrically Activated Shape MemoryCeramics,Case number: #16618,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/electrically-activated-shape-memory-ceramics,"Applications for solid state electrically activated actuators with large strains include: micro-robotics, haptics-tactile interfaces, electronics-camera auto-focus mechanisms, micro and nano positioning, fuel injector actuation.\n\nTechnology: This technology is based on the principle that for any phase transformation to occur there must exist a difference in an extensive variable between the two phases. These materials (e.g., ceria-doped zirconia) exhibit a change polarization between phases, which has not been demonstrated before. This allows the material to produce a mechanical displacement when subject to an electric field. The simplest implementation of this type of actuator would resemble a parallel plate capacitor with a layer of active ceramic material between to conductive electrodes.  Then a voltage could be applied across the material which would induce an electric field and cause the material to actuate.\n\nProblem Addressed: Previous actuators such as shape memory metals or piezoelectrics do not provide large mechanical displacements via direct electrical activation. This invention creates the possibility to actuate a phase transformation with a large mechanical displacement using an electric field.\n\nAdvantages: Actuation due to an electric field. Improved cyclic properties"
MIT,Method and Apparatus for Uniform Single-Sided InductionHeating,Case number: #16611,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/method-and-apparatus-uniform-single-sided-induction,"This technology can be applied to any magnetic induction system that could benefit from an efficient single-sided magnetic field. Examples include induction cooking and wireless power transfer such as phone charging.\n\nTechnology: This invention uses multiple layers of conductive windings coupled to a drive to generate asymmetric magnetic fields. The windings are stacked and arranged so that the magnetic field generated by each winding layer adds on one side of the stack and cancels on the other side. The net magnetic field is thus much higher on one side than the other, allowing the magnetic field to be directed towards a target efficiently. This eliminates the need for bulky magnetic shielding and the associated weight and cost. Each layer in the winding stack can be driven at a different frequency to create a traveling magnetic field that will produce a uniform heating profile for induction cooking.\n\nProblem Addressed: Magnetic induction systems often require a targeted AC (alternating current) magnetic field that is strong on one side while weak on another.  Such magnetic fields can be created by magnetic shields, but the shields are often bulky, heavy, and expensive.  This technology eliminates the need for such shields by efficiently generating single-sided magnetic fields.  This technology can also generate traveling magnetic fields capable of heating induction surfaces uniformly.\n\nAdvantages: Efficient generation of single-sided magnetic field. No magnetic shielding required. Uniform induction heating"
MIT,Refraction Wiggles for Measuring Fluid Depth and Velocity fromVideo,Case number: #17103,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/refraction-wiggles-measuring-fluid-depth-and-velocity,"The Inventors have developed an algorithm for measuring the velocity and 3D location of refractive fluids, such as hot air or gas, from natural videos with textured backgrounds. This method to visualize the movement of refractive fluid elements has exploratory and sensing applications in a wide host of scientific fields, including aeronautical engineering, combustion research, petrochemical probing, and ballistics.\n\nTechnology: The Inventors have developed a passive technique to measure air flow using video sequences. Light rays bend as they travel through the air of differencing densities. Such deflections are exploited in various air measurement techniques. As the air moves, small changes in the refractive properties appear as small visual deformation, called “refraction wiggles,” of the background texture, similar to the shimmering effect experienced when viewing objects across hot asphalt or through exhaust gases. These motions can be tracked using regular video cameras to infer information about the velocity and depth of a refractive fluid layer.The Inventors observe that while intensity features result from a background layer and their location is not directly related to the fluid layer, the wiggles correspond to 3D positions and motion of points on the transparent fluid surface. The movement of those wiggles between multiple frames indicates the motion of the transparent fluid, and its disparity between viewpoints is a good cue for the depth of the fluid surface. The algorithms to track motion and recover position of points on the fluid surface are based on the constant motion of a refraction field. This distortion is measured by computing the wiggle features in an input video, and then using those features to estimate the motion and depth of the fluid, by matching them across frames and viewpoints.\n\nProblem Addressed: Measuring and visualizing the flow of air and fluid has great importance in broad engineering applications. Multiple techniques have been proposed for this purpose, such as sound tomography, yet most either rely on complicated and expensive setups or are restricted to lab use. The Inventors' technique relies on intensity variations in the movement of refractive fluid elements, observed by one or more video cameras, that are consistent over small space-time volumes. These “refraction wiggles” are implemented by their algorithms to 1) measure the motion of refractive fluids in monocular videos, and 2) recover the 3D position of points on the fluid from stereo cameras in a localization process that is cheaper, more accessible, and applicable in natural settings.\n\nAdvantages: Simple setup can be used outdoors or indoors. Algorithms can be used to visualize and measure air flow and 3D location directly from regular videos. First method to provide a complete pipeline that measures the motions and reconstructs the location of refractive flow directly from videos taken in natural settings"
MIT,New Structures for GaN VerticalTransistors,Case number: #17168,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/new-structures-gan-vertical-transistors,"Gallium Nitride (GaN) vertical transistors are used in power electronics to achieve high power conversion efficiency.\n\nTechnology: This new transistor is based on a nano-wire structure. The channel of the transistor is made of a nano-ribbon shaped material, instead of the planar large-area quantum well or two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) typically used in these devices until now. The proposed structure can be implemented on III-N wafers grown both N-face and Ga-face. To achieve high breakdown voltage, special junction termination techniques are used to control and shape the electric field at the edges of the devices. These techniques include field plate, guard rings, bevel edge termination and junction termination extension. The fabricated transistor demonstrated a threshold voltage of 1V and a specific on resistance of 0.36 mΩcm2. By proper electric field engineering, 800 V blocking voltage was achieved at a gate bias of 0 V.\n\nProblem Addressed: The dominant GaN device architecture today is the lateral High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) heterostructure. However, the lateral GaN HEMT device architecture has two key limitations. First, careful management of electric field profiles in the lateral dimension between contacts is required, particularly in high voltage applications. Substantial gate/drain lateral spacing must be maintained to allow high breakdown voltage, which reduces the effective current density. Second, thermal management is complicated by the fact that all current flow is confined to a relatively thin portion of the device near the top surface. In contrast, a vertical GaN device architecture could overcome these limitations because high electric fields occur between contacts on the bottom and top of the structure in the vertical dimension only.\n\nAdvantages: Increases break down voltage. Increases effective current density"
MIT,Single Wall Carbon Nanotubes as In VivoSensors,Case number: #16531,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/single-wall-carbon-nanotubes-vivo-sensors,"The current device presents a photoluminescent single-walled carbon nanotube based nanosensor, embedded in a hydrogel, which can be used for detection of analytes. Nitric oxide (NO) presents an interesting case study for such a sensor. NO is an important cellular signaling molecule, critical for maintaining vascular physiology and regulating immune defense. In addition, its paradoxical roles in carcinogenesis remain unclear, with experimental results that suggest both pro- and anticancer effects.\n\nTechnology: In this technology, the first fluorescence-based SWNT sensing array is made of single-stranded d(AT)15 DNA oligonucleotide-wrapped SWNTs (AT15-SWNT). This 30-base oligomer imparts SWNTs with the capability of directly, and selectively, quantifying NO concentrations. It is found that the AT -SWNT15 complex is unique in its high selectivity toward NO when compared with a library of other DNA sequences and polymers.\n\nProblem Addressed: This technology allows for long-time in vivo detection of analytes. It has been established that there are two fundamental factors complicating the biological effects of NO in vivo: its concentration and its location of production. Accurate detection of NO is essential to understanding its diverse biological roles. Difficulties arise mainly due to its rapid diffusivity and high reactivity with endogenous molecules, including oxygen, exposed thiols, other free radicals, and heme proteins. In many cases, both the resultant short lifetime and its cellular reaction by products affect the accuracy of detection. Chemical approaches to the detection of nitric oxide or its reaction products have been a constant focus of research in recent years, most commonly the design and synthesis of organic fluorophores or quantum dots that modulate fluorescence upon exposure to NO. The ability to detect nitric oxide quantitatively at the single-molecule level may find applications in new cellular assays for the study of nitric oxide carcinogenesis and chemical signaling, as well as medical diagnostics for inflammation.\n\nAdvantages: Long-time detection. In vivo detection. Single-molecule level detection. New cellular assays for the study of nitric oxide carcinogenesis and chemical signaling. Novel tool for medical diagnostics. Implantable platform for in vivo sensing"
MIT,Algorithms for Scheduled Lightpath Switching in Optical Networks with ChannelImpairments,Case number: #17279,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/algorithms-scheduled-lightpath-switching-optical,"The Inventors have developed a lightpath scheduling algorithm to facilitate optical communication via Erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA)-based optical networks.\n\nTechnology: This patented technology predicts the channel quality of a lightpath based on how EDFAs are distributed along the lightpath and the number of channels that are lit up in the same fiber. The scheduling algorithm chooses the first available lightpath that can accommodate the requested transmission duration and does not overlap in time with other scheduled sessions on the same wavelength along a candidate path. The first available lightpath is then checked for quality using the models at times during the transmission session when there is a change of channel configuration (i.e. the number of channels that are lit up in a fiber). If the lightpath is not qualified at one or more times of change of channel configuration, the algorithm recursively starts the searching of the next first available lightpath starting from the time when the lightpath fails the quality check.\n\nProblem Addressed: Present-day networks are being challenged by dramatic increases in data rate demands of emerging applications. Incorporating fast lightpath switching into optical network architectures is critical to enable the growth, power efficiency, and cost-effective scalability of next-generation networks. A lightpath is an end-to-end all optical connection from the source node to the destination node composed of a constant wavelength. Scheduled lightpath switches improve network resource utilization while maintaining a good network performance by relinquishing network resources to other users. The Inventors’ algorithm for lightpath switching utilizes models of physical layer impairments to make sure the scheduled lightpath is not corrupted by switching induced channel impairments in EDFA-amplified optical networks\n\nAdvantages: Easy-to-implement algorithm that needs far fewer steps and less time to light up one wavelength (~50ms) than minutes for existing techniques. Predictive models of channel quality can be used to greatly reduce the amount of network sensing, reporting traffic and control plane complexity"
MIT,"High-Frequency, High Density PFC PowerConversion",Case number: #17250,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/high-frequency-high-density-pfc-power-conversion,"This technology can be used to improve grid interfaced power converters involved in applications ranging from powering handheld devices to distributing power throughout giant server farms.\n\nTechnology: The invention achieves a power density higher than 10 W/in^3 from universal ac input through the increase of the switching frequency. The device's ability to operate at switching rates much higher than conventional power converters allows for the device to maintain high efficiency even at a smaller size. The invention is can handle high operating frequencies due to circuit topologies that are capable of operating with relatively small inductances and large capacitances. The device is capable of operating within a wide range of input voltages (85-245 VAC RMS) and loads, with good power factor (0.9-0.95), and efficiencies of 90% or higher.\n\nProblem Addressed: High efficiency (90% or higher) conventional power converters for DC power supplies operate at low switching frequencies (200Hz or lower) and require bulky magnetic elements. These systems are large and expensive, and achieve low power densities of 10 W/in or lower.

MIT,A Concentric Circle Scanning Technique for Large AreaInspection,Case number: #17259,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/concentric-circle-scanning-technique-large-area,"Applications for this technology are found in sampling and super high resolution imaging, and more specifically in machine vision, medical imaging, surveillance, remote sensing, and scanning microscopy.\n\nTechnology: This technology is an optimized rotational sampling method that allows fast and uniform acquisition of image information on a circular surface. The technique has demonstrated the capability to increase sampling speed by 11.5% while reducing distortion error by 50%. Circular scanning method combined with SR techniques can increase the achievable resolution of existing scanners with large field of vision, without additional hardware.\n\nProblem Addressed: Large area scanning and super high resolution (SR) imaging of surfaces traditionally relies on the translation of results obtained by scanning and sampling in Cartesian coordinates. These techniques require complex hardware and/or software methods to ensure low vibration, fast scanning and high precision, and have issues such as registration errors induced by poor motion estimation, limited recovery of high frequencies in non-lateral dimensions, and vibration induced image degradation in some sensitive devices. Existing rotational sampling methods suffer from sparse data and variation in the outer radii as a result of uniform Polar sampling.\n\nAdvantages: Higher speed and attenuated transient behavior for large area inspections. Minimized errors when using circular scanning trajectory to generate Cartesian composite image. No tradeoff between resolution and field of vision. Reduced vibration, higher speed, and easier control. Compensates for hardware limitations such as motor speed and resonant frequency issues.

MIT,Ice Cream 3D Printing viaFDM,Case number: #17297K,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/ice-cream-3d-printing-fdm,"This invention can be applied to produce custom geometry in ice cream or similar cold slurry substances.\n\nTechnology: The main components of the ice cream, or cold slurry, 3D printer described by the Inventors are a cooled print chamber, a heated extruder, a movable print bed, and cryogenic shield gas system. Completely thawing and refreezing ice cream often has a detrimental effect on its texture. Therefore, the described system maintains the reservoir of ice cream in a frozen state at approximately 10 ℉. In operation, this frozen ice cream is pumped onto the print bed through an extruder which is locally heated to prevent clogging. The extruded ice cream is rapidly cooled and solidified by an array of liquid nitrogen jets arranged around the extruder. Through laboratory tests, the Inventors determined a set of values for print parameters such as layer height, traverse velocity, and extruder diameter that enabled successful printing of single serving-sized 2.5D ice cream structures within 15 minutes.\n\nProblem Addressed: Conventional 3D printers utilizing FDM technology typically maintain elevated print bed and/or print chamber temperatures. This limits them to processing materials with melting points above room temperature. This invention describes a novel method of fused deposition modelling utilizing a cooled chamber and a cryogenic shield gas that expands the range of 3D-printable materials.\n\nAdvantages: Extends FDM to materials with melting points below room temperature"
MIT,Cycloelimination Reactions of SIMes and Related N-Heterocyclic Carbenes to Generate N-Heterocyclic Carbene CarbodiimideAdducts,Case number: #17268,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/cycloelimination-reactions-simes-and-related-n,"The synthesis of N-heterocyclic carbene-bis(aryl) carbodiimide (NHC-CDI) is a fundamental discovery, for which specific applications are currently being explored. NHC-CDIs are a novel structural class of molecule with potential application as ligands for Lewis acidic species (e.g., transition metal cations). The development of novel ligand classes is critical to the discovery of transition metal catalysts and crucial to the fields of organometallic chemistry and materials science. Additionally, NHC-CDIs absorb visible light and emit violet-indigo fluorescence, rendering them suitable as novel optical sensors for transition metals.\n\nTechnology: Since the first demonstration of their potential stability, isolation, and storability, NHCs have become pervasive in both experimental and commercial applications as electron-rich, neutral ligands. One of the most widely used classes of NHCs—1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-2-imidazolidinylidene, known as “SIMes”—are commercially available and widely used as ligands and catalysts. Upon heating, NHCs of the SIMes family can be converted via a [3+2]-cycloelimination process to a novel class of NHCs known as NHC-CDI amidinates, notably useful as novel ligand scaffolds for Lewis acidic metals. An even broader array of NHC-CDIs could be prepared by the direct addition of the NHC to the CDI.  This method allows the steric bulk and electronics of both components to be independently tuned for desired NHC-CDI performance. Isolable NHC-CDI adducts have been reported only once previously, and were structurally distinctive from those generated as described above, rendering them less practical for commercial use. NHC-CDI adducts generated as described above are uniquely stable at both ambient conditions and in the presence of moisture. Additionally, NHC-CDIs absorb visible light and emit violet-indigo fluorescence, conferring optical sensor functionality. A much broader array of NHC-CDIs could be prepared by the direct addition of the NHC to the CDI.  This method allows the steric bulk and electronics of both components to be independently tuned to achieve the desired NHC-CDI chemical and photophysical properties, including air-stability, metal ligation, and UV-vis absorbance profile.\n\nProblem Addressed: The development of ligands with distinctive properties and reactivity is critical to the discovery of new metal catalysts. This method of production of a novel metal ligand class (NHC-CDIs) is easily performed and results in a uniquely bench-stable construct that exhibits robust binding and ligand properties.\n\nAdvantages: Easily synthesized via commercially available and air-stable NHCs. Stable under ambient conditions for months and in the presence of moisture for at least 3 days. Novel ligand for Lewis acidic metals. Optical sensor capabilities"

The textiles consist of compression elements made in a form of springs that are woven into the fabrics. The actuators utilize the shape memory effect in order to produce compression motion and are fabricated using Nickel and Titanium materials. The springs are ‘trained’ to conform to a preprogrammed shape upon direct electrical stimulation and return to its original shape when stimulus is removed. Shape of the compression garments changes according to the way actuation springs are woven into the garments.The invention includes a cartridge that spatially arranges actuators within textiles and locks them in a compressed state once they are actuated. The cartridge also provides customizable interfaces required for interaction of actuators with fabrics.\n\nProblem Addressed: Functional textiles, such as compression textiles, hold significant promise for a variety of industries, including but not limited to, athletics, healthcare and space. Existing approaches towards implementation of compression textiles rely exclusively on the pneumatic bladders and tight-fitting passive materials. None of the existing technological solutions, though being advantageous in specific circumstances, allows for implementation of lightweight and well-fitted compression textiles that provide active control over the compression process.\n\nAdvantages: Active control over the process of compression.

Multipurpose compression garments with possibility to be used in a variety of applications"
MIT,One-Step Protein Analysis Using Slanted NanofilterArray,Case number: #17391,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/one-step-protein-analysis-using-slanted-nanofilter,"Protein pre-concentration and size separation for point-of-care biologic quality / purity testing, filtration and separation of nanomaterials (e.g., nanoparticles, nanotubes), DNA separation and sequencing.\n\nTechnology: Size-based separation of proteins is widely used to check the purity of protein drugs in the pharmaceutical manufacturing process and to insure the absence of toxic impurities. Drawbacks of existing methods such as size exclusion chromatography, SDS-PAGE and gel electrophoresis include laborious manual processing, low separation resolution, low sensitivity and low accuracy due to adsorption of the sample molecules onto the sieving matrix. The current technology provides a new platform nanofluidic chip for potentially automated, single step protein analysis. The device, composed of slanted nanofilter arrays with periodically-patterned deep and shallow nanoslits, demonstrates both protein pre-concentration and size based protein separation as a one-step process. This is done by having two regions within the device with different angles (135 degrees for pre-concentration and 45 degrees for separation). The protein mixture is mechanically focused (pre-concentrated) at the bottom edge of the channel and then size-separated into a different stream continuously.\n\nProblem Addressed: This technology provides a one-step process for protein pre-concentration and separation by size but requiring minute amount of sample volume.\n\nAdvantages: Rapid (30 minutes). Single device, one-step process. Continuous monitoring (real-time release). Small sample volume. High reproducibility. Robust and reusable device (years)"
MIT,Infrared Transparent Visible Opaque Fabrics(ITVOF),Case number: #17390,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/infrared-transparent-visible-opaque-fabrics-itvof,"The materials in this technology have been engineered primarily for clothing . The material enables thermal radiative heat transfer to increase user comfort. These fabrics provide cooling regardless of the wearer's activity or surrounding environment.\n\nTechnology: A model of the system, including a person and their clothes, was created to analyze the effects of incorporating IVTOF in clothing.  It was determined that a transmittance of 34-43% in the IR spectrum is required to achieve sufficient cooling. Using polyethylene (PE), with a maximum yarn thickness of 100µm, the minimum spectrally integrated transmittance in the IR spectrum was 48.8%, which is greater than the required transmittance. The second requirement of a clothing fabric is opaqueness in the visible spectrum. Polyester and cotton cloths exhibited uniform reflectance of 40-50% in the visible spectrum and the PE sample exhibited 50-60%. Therefore, PE fabrics are one potential material for IVTOF.  Fabrication of these materials consists of three steps; extrusion of molten polymer through a spinneret into a bundle of fibers, drawing of fibers, and spooling the fibers into a yarn. The spinneret is designed to include the total number of fibers in a yarn allowing equal production rate for fibers and yarns. Once the yarns are created, they can be woven into fabric with commercially available looms.\n\nProblem Addressed: State-of-the-art cooling technologies have predominantly focused on clothing (e.g. moisture wicking, phase change materials, active cooling technologies) for individuals who are performing high levels of physical activity. Additionally, materials currently used for clothing fabrics (e.g. cotton and polyester) have a transmittance of 1-2% in the infrared (IR) spectrum, which doesn't allow cooling via radiation. ITVOF are transparent in the infrared spectrum and increase a person’s cooling rate by >23W. Personal cooling rate and ambient temperature affect personal thermal comfort. Therefore, increasing a person's cooling rate allows a higher ambient temperature to achieve the same level of comfort. Specifically, a >23W increase in cooling rate allows an ambient temperature increase ≥ 4oF (to ~79oF), which leads to lower air conditiong set points and significant energy savings in buildings.\n\nAdvantages: Increased thermal comfort in clothing. Increased energy savings by increased air conditioning set points"
MIT,Ratiometric and Multiplexed Sensors from Single Chirality CarbonNanotubes,Case number: #17314,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/ratiometric-and-multiplexed-sensors-single-chirality,"This technology has applications towards monitoring plant behavior, measuring pesticide levels in plans, and detecting environmental stresses, such as drought, salinity, and unusually high levels of UV-B radiation. It also has applications towards imaging cells and animal tissues.\n\nTechnology: Professor Michael Strano and colleagues have developed a method for in vivo sensing by measuring the relative emission intensities from a mixture of functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes.  The properties of the groups of nanotubes in the mixture can be adjusted such that each has a unique emission spectrum and binding target.  The sensors can be passively delivered, and do not interfere with proper functioning of the organism. Moreover, the mixture also includes non-functionalized nanoparticles that serve as internal reference standards, thereby significantly reducing the effects of background noise.  When used in plants, these particles have been shown to detect the reactive oxygen species nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide, the signaling molecule dopamine, and the pesticide glyphosate.\n\nProblem Addressed: Sensing molecules circulating in living organisms is a useful way to monitor structure, function, and overall health.   However, in vivo sensors are often difficult to develop, due to the potential for toxicity and a lack of sensitivity resulting from the complexity of most biological tissues and high background or non-specific interactions.\n\nAdvantages: Non-toxic. High specificity and sensitivity. Easily synthesized and multiplexed. Can be used in plant or animal cells and tissues"
MIT,Magnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles for Magnetic ParticleImaging,Case number: #17354,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/magnetic-iron-oxide-nanoparticles-magnetic-particle,"Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a tomographic imaging technique in which superparamagnetic, iron oxide nanoparticles are injected into the bloodstream, generating magnetic fields that are measured to produce 3D images. The inventors have developed monodisperse and highly magnetic large iron-oxide nanoparticles to increase the MPI signal strength.\n\nTechnology: These large magnetite (Fe3O4) magnetic nanoparticles are prepared by decomposing iron oleate precursors at high temperature (290°C – 390 °C). The high reaction temperature encourages the formation of larger nanoparticles. Upon completion, the nanoparticles are precipitated by adding chloroform and acetone, centrifuged, and re-dispersed and stored in hexane.The resulting ~35 nm iron oxide nanoparticles become water soluble upon deposition of a hydrophilic silica shell. The silica shell is formed on the surface of nanoparticles by decomposing tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in a cyclohexane solvent in the presence of Igepal CO-520 and ammonium hydroxide. The resulting iron oxide/silica shell nanoparticles have an inorganic diameter of ~50 nm and can be dispersed in water and various aqueous buffers. The nanoparticles are coated by polyethylene glycol derivatives such as methoxy polyethylene glycol silane to improve their long-term stability in aqueous media.\n\nProblem Addressed: MPI offers more advanced imaging than other commonly used techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with high sensitivity and resolution along with near-perfect contrast due to the diamagnetic nature of human tissue. MPI signal strength and efficiency are dependent on the synthesis and size control of large magnetic nanoparticles. Theoretical simulations predicted that the currently used commercial MPI contrast agent, Resovist®, has a limited signal strength similar to that of 3% iron oxide nanoparticles with a 30 nm inorganic diameter or above. However, the synthesis of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in the ≥ 30 nm domain is challenging and rarely reported. To this end, the inventors have developed monodisperse and highly magnetic 35 nm iron oxide nanoparticles that are expected to improve the existing MPI signal strength of Resovist® by over 90%.\n\nAdvantages: 35 nm iron oxide nanoparticles demonstrate > 90% increased MPI signal strength compared with Resovist®. Particles display good stability in aqueous media"
MIT,Miniaturized 3DIC IntegratedPackage,Case number: #17313L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/miniaturized-3dic-integrated-package,"This interconnect technology is applicable to multi-layer semiconductor devices. Multi-layered devices can be used in military and commercial applications. This includes sensor processing, data recording, communication, and flight electronics. On the commercial side, this is applicable to portable consumer electronics like cell phones, tablets, and laptops.\n\nTechnology: A miniaturized 3DIC integrated electronic package has multiple functional sections attached to each other through oxide bonding where each section can have single or multiple layers. Micro vias confined within opposing layers, interconnect between layers of each functional section. The vias may have variable diameter from top to bottom to maximize space efficiency. The 3DIC package can also be attached to multi-chip modules through microbumps or pillar technology. Instead of microbumps, a third via can be used to make electrical connection between two stacks where the third via is a high CTE metal with equal or larger size and pitch than the second micro via. The materials stack-up for each functional section may vary but at least one functional section will contain one active transistor layer and two local interconnect routing layers for each active transistor layer. The bonding of multiple functional sections allows the mixture of III-V transistors with Silicon CMOS, for example.\n\nProblem Addressed: There is a trend toward miniaturization of electronic products in mobile phones, tablets, and digital cameras. Consequently, there is a trend in semiconductor device manufacturing towards smaller and more densely packed semiconductor structures. This has resulted in a demand for semiconductor packages which are relatively low loss, lightweight structures and which support increased electronic capabilities (e.g., increased density, mobility and extended operational life) in miniaturized electronic products demanded by both military and commercial customers alike. The foregoing trend and demand, drives a need for multi-layer semiconductor devices, semiconductor devices including at least two semiconductor structures. There is consequently, a need for interconnect structures which enable assembly of multi-layer semiconductor devices.\n\nAdvantages: Enhanced system capabilities as well as reduced size, weight, power, and cost. Significant reduction in the length of metal interconnect lines yielding increased circuit speed, decreased power loss. Increased freedom in mixing technologies and materials without compromising performance, widening the design space for this device.

MIT,Upconversion and Downconversion Utilizing Thin Film Colloidal Nanocrystals and OrganicMaterials,Case number: #17397,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/upconversion-and-downconversion-utilizing-thin-film,"The structure of thin film colloidal nanocrystals coupled with an organic material allows for the upconversion or downconversion of incoherent light with high efficiency. Potential applications include: photovoltaics, near infrared (NIR) photodetection, displays, photochemistry, medical imaging and other medicinal purposes such as activating a medical process like the desorption of a drug, and lighting.\n\nTechnology: For either upconversion or downconversion, an organic material is combined with colloidal nanocrystals either as a deposited multilayer structure or in a blend of the two materials. The employed nanocrystals are lead (II) sulfide (PbS) colloidal nanocrystals coated with a thermally-evaporated layer of tetracene or rubrene. The PbS nanocrystals coupled to tetracene resulted in 90% triplet exciton transfer from tetracene to the nanocrystal, through the short-range Dexter process, for efficient downconversion. Those coupled to rubrene led to upconversion in the practical form of a thin film coating. The coating achieved a record-high anti-Stokes shift of about 1eV. This increase can shift light from NIR to the photovoltaic optimal spectrum (1.1-1.5eV), greatly increasing the harvestable spectrum and increasing overall efficiency.\n\nProblem Addressed: In current photovoltaics, about two-thirds of the incident spectrum is lost. Photons either do not have enough energy to move electrons to the conduction band or they have excess energy that is converted to heat. Tunable upconversion - converting two or more low energy photons to one higher energy photon - or downconversion - taking one high energy photon and converting it to two or more low energy photons - can reduce these spectrum losses by converting photons to the most useful energy.  In NIR photodetection, displays, medical imaging, and lighting, there are photons that are outside of the harvestable spectrum and photon conversion would reduce losses in emission or absorption resulting in better efficiency and increase detection range. For example, generating two red photons from a single UV photon instead of one could increase the efficiency of fluorescent lighting by up to 30%. Most state-of-the-art photon conversion devices (e.g. lanthanides and non-linear crystals) require high intensity, coherent light and the alternatives (e.g. triplet-triplet-annihilation) have limited bandwidth of operation, typically unable to make use of NIR spectrum. The proposed technology uses organic materials coupled to colloidal nanocrystals to allow the performance of up or down conversion from relatively low intensity, broadband, incoherent light.\n\nAdvantages: Increased external quantum efficiency. Inclusion of more wavelengths into the useful spectrum. Thin films for facile device integration"

MIT,Synthetic Aperture Radar Between Independent WirelessNodes,Case number: #16788,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/synthetic-aperture-radar-between-independent-wireless,"This technology enables synthetic or inverse synthetic aperture radar (I/SAR) techniques to be performed on independent transmitters and receivers, which do not necessarily share a common frequency or clock reference. It has commercial applications in processes that involve synthetic aperture radar imaging, localization, and gesture sensing between distributed wireless nodes, and can be used for example, to develop a wireless device that can identify the locations of cellular phones in the environment or a Wi-Fi access point that can localize surrounding client nodes.\n\nTechnology: This method considers a multi-antenna MIMO receiver that receives signals from a single or multi-antenna transmitter node. At least one of the antennas of the receiver can either translate or rotate, while at least one other antenna remains static. The receiver measures the wireless channels from the transmitter node to these antennas over time. The inventors show that the ratio of the channels from any single transmit antenna to the receiver’s moving antenna and static antennas is independent of frequency offset. This ratio can therefore be used instead of the wireless channels themselves to perform SAR. As a consequence, this system allows a wireless receiver to calculate the relative power of the signals it receives from any particular wireless transmitter along any given direction. Further, it does not require any additional modification to or feedback from the transmitter nodes.To perform SAR, a wireless receiver must periodically estimate the wireless channel from a transmitter node. As a result, the receiver needs to be aware of the actual signal transmitted by the wireless transmitter. However, if the transmitter is a single-antenna device, this system offers the additional advantage of not requiring prior knowledge of the actual signal transmitted by the transmitter node. In other words, the receiver can perform SAR from a single-antenna transmitter, purely from the received signals, without actually estimating the wireless channels from this transmitter to its receiver antennas.\n\nProblem Addressed: A receiving wireless node may perform SAR and ISAR techniques on signals from independent transmitter devices to measure the relative power of the signals it receives from this transmitter. The key challenge to enable this technology is that radar techniques require both the transmitter and receiver to share a common frequency or clock reference. This is because independent transmitters and receivers suffer from a frequency offset between their clocks, as well as phase noise. The Inventors have developed a technology which leverages the multiple-input, multiple output (MIMO) capability of a multi-antenna receiver to perform radar techniques despite these frequency offsets.\n\nAdvantages: System can perform SAR from a single-antenna transmitting node without being aware of the precise signal transmitted by that node in the specified frequency. Technology can extend to the case of a multi-antenna transmitter or generalize to single antenna OFDM transmitters"
MIT,Functional and Universal Surface Anchors Based on N-HeterocyclicCarbenes,Case number: #15855,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/functional-and-universal-surface-anchors-based-n,"Tightly-bound, functionalized, conducting surfaces for applications in microelectronics and electronics; Coatings for medical devices or protective coatings; biosensors; solar cell coatings; semiconductor applications\n\nTechnology: One of the long-standing problems in surface chemistry is the lack of a universal anchor group that offers strong and well-defined surface binding, better electronic coupling with the surface, and addressable functionality. Known for their strong binding to a variety of metals and metalloids, N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) were chosen as candidate surface-coating molecules. The current technology creates novel addressable NHC-based anchors, confirming and defining their binding and electronic coupling to gold, while demonstrating their aptitude for tandem functionalization of gold surfaces. Most current methods for modifying gold surfaces use thiols as linking molecules. Thiols bind the gold surface and then serve as an anchor for adding functional groups that have useful properties. However, this approach has two major drawbacks: 1) the gold-thiol bonds are weak, and can be disrupted by heat or chemical oxidation; and 2) they are sometimes poor electrical conductors, limiting their use for electronics applications. This technology is a method to functionalize surfaces using NHC molecules as anchors.  The NHC bonds are better electrical conductors, so this technology is well-suited for microelectronics and molecular electronics. In addition to modifying gold surfaces, this technology can be extended to work on other types of surfaces, making it a uniquely versatile method with a broad range of applications. Because the NHCs can attach functional groups, potential applications are extended to biomedical and electronic uses, such as biosensors, nanoparticles for drug delivery and medical imaging, biomedical and industrial coatings, and semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nProblem Addressed: This technology introduces a new surface coating system, where N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are attached to surfaces, forming anchors for further surface functionalization, while ensuring durable attachment and conductivity.\n\nAdvantages: NHC bonds at the surface are strong and offer durable materials. Coatings are more conductive, allowing microelectronics applications. NHCs can serve as anchors to chemically or electrically modify the surface. NHCs can bind to a variety of surfaces including gold, silver, silicon, and quantum dots"

The rate at which the light sources are sequentially activated exceeds the frame rate of the detector, resulting in generating multiple images of the moving object within a single frame of the detector. The devices and methods described herein, including a saccadometry system, can utilize off-the-shelf components and does not require expensive high-frame-rate video equipment.

An example of this system can be mounted on a helmet or other article and used to record hours of audio data at a bandwidth of 20 kHz or higher, which is broad enough to capture sounds with rise times less than 50 ms. An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) digitizes these broadband audio signals at rate of 40 kHz or higher to preserve the impulse information.

MIT,Method for Coded-Source Phase Contrast X-RayImaging,Case number: #16308JQ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/method-coded-source-phase-contrast-x-ray-imaging,"Described here is a method for performing phase contrast imaging using an array of independently controllable x-ray sources. The array of x-ray sources can be controlled to produce a distinct spatial pattern of x-ray radiation and thus can be used to encode phase contrast signals without the need for a coded aperture. The lack of coded aperture increases the flexibility of the imaging method. For instance, because a fixed, coded aperture is not required, the angular resolution of the imaging technique can be increased as compared to coded-aperture imaging. Moreover, the lack of a radioopaque coded aperture increases the photon flux that reaches the subject, thereby increasing the attainable signal-to-noise ratio."

At high charge levels, a nondestructive amplifier senses the charge at the CCD register output to provide an analog indication of the charge. At low charge levels, noiseless charge splitters or meters divide the charge into single-electron packets, each of which is detected by a GM-AD that provides a digital output indicating whether an electron is present. Example electron counters are particularly well suited for counting photoelectrons generated by large-format, high-speed imaging arrays because they operate with high dynamic range and high sensitivity. As a result, they can be used to image scenes over a wide range of light levels."
MIT,Inter-Detector Scatter Enhanced Positron EmissionTomography,Case number: #15769,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/inter-detector-scatter-enhanced-positron-emission,"This technology is an apparatus, method, and calculation that increases the sensitivity of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanners by isolating and correcting inter-detector scatter (IDS) events. This invention improves PET image quality and can be applied in preclinical and clinical settings to perform functions such as the detection of solid tumors.\n\nTechnology: This technology is a strategy to improve PET scanner sensitivity by normalizing and correcting sorted IDS events. The correction calculation, determined during a calibration step, can then be applied to a coincidence data set generated by the scanner to yield meaningful coincidence information.In calibration, a radiation source is uniformly exposed to all detector pairs in a PET scanner. Double coincidences and IDS coincidences are acquired until enough measurements have been collected to achieve statistical significance in both data sets. IDS events are then sorted and represented, for example, in an LOR histogram. The number of IDS events sorted to a particular LOR is then divided by the average number of IDS events for all of the LORs in the scanner to calculate IDS normalization values for each LOR. In contrast to other normalization methods, which only generate normalization value for double coincidences, this method provides a second set of normalization values for IDS events. During the PET scan, sets of double coincidences and IDS coincidences are collected and stored as separate LOR histogram. The corresponding normalization (from calibration) will be applied independently to each data set. After correction, the data sets are added together to provide normalized information for accurate image reconstruction.\n\nProblem Addressed: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans are frequently used in the early detection of solid tumors, as well as for evaluating heart disease and multiple neurological disorders. In PET, the patient is administered a radioactive tracer that accumulates in metabolically active tissues, such as tumors. The radioactive tracer emits photons which are detected by the scanner. Specifically, PET scanners are optimized to detect double coincidences, which occur when two photons emitted from the same annihilation event encounter opposite block detectors within a specific coincidence time window. Double coincidences provide valid, meaningful information. Scattered coincidences are also detected by the PET scanner and produce distorted information that decreases the sensitivity of PET scanners. Scatter coincidences occur when at least one of the emitted photons undergoes scattering and loses a fraction of its total energy before its detection, and the event is then detected by a pair of detectors that are non-collinear with the originating annihilation. Current methods for correcting inter-detector scatter (IDS) coincidence data involve sorting a given IDS coincidence event to the appropriate line-of-response (LOR) by determining the most likely order of detection of an IDS coincidence from the initial annihilation event. The sorted IDS coincidence data set and double coincidence data set are then merged and normalized solely based on information from the double-coincidence data set. However, this approach produces artifacts in resulting PET images, thereby reducing the sensitivity of the scanner in preclinical and clinical applications.  Increasing the sensitivity of PET systems could reduce scan time and reduce the amount of radioactive compound injected to the patient to obtain similar quality images. This invention corrects and normalizes IDS information to generate more accurate PET images.\n\nAdvantages: Utilizes IDS events, which are usually discarded because they produce noise in PET images, to improve PET scanner sensitivity and image quality. Appropriately corrects and normalizes double coincidences and IDS coincidences generated by a PET scanner. Improves sensitivity of PET scans by up to 20%, which will improve diagnostics and reduce the amount of radioactive tracer required. Inexpensive to implement because technology only requires a software modification to the PET scanner"
MIT,Switched-Capacitor Split Drive Transformer Power ConversionArchitecture,Case number: #16667,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/switched-capacitor-split-drive-transformer-power,"Novel converter architectures, construction methods, and associated controls to achieve efficiency at high conversion ratios over wide operating ranges, with high degree of integration, manufacturability, and reliability are crucial in building high performance power converters. These converters have applications in power supplies for DC distribution systems, computers, telecommunications and data centers, as well as applications in transportation, lighting, displays, and medical applications among many other areas where high power density and fast response are required\n\nTechnology: The invented power converter comprises a power distributor and inverter stage, coupled to a power combiner and rectifier stage through a split-drive transformer (SDT) stage which uses magnetic coupling to step up/down voltage and provide isolation between the distributor and combiner stages. The SDT structure architecture reduces transformer parasitic effects and absorbs the transformer parasitics into circuit operation. This ideally eliminates the effect of transformer parasitic components and enables the transformer to operate closer to their ideal transformer characteristics. Power combiner and rectifier receives the signals provided from SDT stage and combines the signals into an output provided to a load/source. The SDT architecture utilizes the transformer together with a circuit power stage (power distributor stage). Specifically, the power distributor and inverter stage has two functions: 1) to take the overall input power and voltage, condition it and distribute it to multiple paths to interface with the split-drive transformer stage, and 2) to maintain the variation of its outputs within a narrow (voltage) range even if its input has big variations. The SDT architecture combined with the circuit power stage acts to process the power in multiple voltage domains, and to compress the required operation range of each voltage domain, leading to a higher efficiency of the overall system.\n\nProblem Addressed: Traditionally, magnetic converter-based architectures with isolation such as forward converters or fly back converters transformers are widely used to reach high conversion ratios. They are simple, low-cost and easy to control. However, as the switching frequency is pushed higher, the converter timing becomes difficult, and the parasitic effects significantly increase the loss. Circuits using high-gain transformers or tapped inductors can provide desirable duty ratios and reduce device switching stress. However, the leakage inductance of the tapped inductor can ring with the parasitic capacitance of the switches, limiting its feasibility at high switching frequency. High-frequency-link architectures can reduce or eliminate this ringing problem by absorbing parasitics such as transformer leakage inductance into circuit operation. Such circuits can often realize soft switching and switch at a higher frequency than conventional hard-switched architectures. As the switching frequency increases, parasitics effects become larger, and associated proximity-effect currents induce more loss. To overcome these limitations, the proposed power conversion architecture incorporates advanced transformer structure design with a circuit power stage to enable the power converter to work efficiently over wide operating range.\n\nAdvantages: Enable high conversion ratios over wide operating ranges (of voltages and powers). Reduces transformer parasitic effects and enables the transformer to operate closer to ideal transformer characteristics"
MIT,"Uniprocessor Schedulability Test and Scheduler for Task Sets with Well-Formed Precedence Relations, Temporal Deadlines, and WaitConstraints",Case number: #15539,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/uniprocessor-schedulability-test-and-scheduler-task,"This scheduling solution is designed to achieve high-quality sequencing of human and robotic workers in a myriad of industry applications including engineering, aerospace and commercial manufacturing.\n\nTechnology: This computationally efficient approach for performing factory-relevant scheduling relies on modeling the robotic and human workers in the system as processors within a computer. The build piece (e.g. the part currently being worked on) is modeled as a shared memory resource that the “processors” (human and robotic workers) must coordinate to access. The full solution to the multi-robot coordination problem relies on the efficient solution to this single robot scheduling problem.Assembly tasks are related through precedence constraints, where tasks must be completed within a given time window, and wait constraints, where a given task must be started a minimum time t after a previous task ends. A check is performed to determine whether deadline constraints are temporally consistent with the task costs, wait constraints, and network structure, and whether a task set can be executed in parallel with a set of currently executing deadline constraints. Once it is established that these task sets are “well-formed” according to these composability rules, a sufficient schedulability criteria is computed in polynomial time. The Inventors provide an Earliest Deadline First (EDF)-based scheduling strategy for task sets that meet this schedulability criteria, a method shown to be optimal for uniprocessor environments.\n\nProblem Addressed: Industrial robots can provide significant flexibility in manufacturing operations compared to the current state-of-the-art large, gantry-style automated solutions. Harnessing the full capability of these robotic systems requires coordinating work-sharing and scheduling among multiple human workers and robots to achieve safety and high productivity despite inevitable disturbances due to robot servicing and other unanticipated delays in the build process. The Inventors have developed a solution for flexible work sequencing and scheduling (WSS) capable of automatically rescheduling a robot’s action sequence to adapt to changes in a work plan, while guaranteeing hard scheduling deadlines are met.\n\nAdvantages: Approach is far more efficient and scalable than previous state-of-the-art scheduling solutions which can take up to hours to compute a feasible schedule. Flexible scheduling adapts to changes in the work plan while still meeting hard deadlines. Schedulability criteria is tight and informative for real-world structured problems"
MIT,An Effective Coreset Compression Algorithm for Large Scale SensorNetworks,Case number: #15559,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/effective-coreset-compression-algorithm-large-scale,"The Inventors present a data compression algorithm that employs a small coreset of a large sensor data set to yield a highly efficient compression system. This technology can be used in any applications where signal compression and simplification is desired, including services that handle video streams from wearable cameras, mobile sensors, GPS-based location and mapping, financial data and biological signals.\n\nTechnology: The Inventors use techniques from computational geometry to solve problems in data and signal compression using coresets. The input to the coreset algorithm is a constant e > 0, and a set P of n points in representing n signals from d sensors) that can be approximated by k segments. The algorithm returns a coreset of O(k) points, whose size is independent of the original input n, such that the Hausdorff Euclidean distance from P to any given set of points is preserved up to an additive error of e. This compression guarantees an approximation error for any query.These coresets can be constructed in parallel, as well as in a streaming setting where data points arrive one by one, in which it would be otherwise impossible to remember the entire data set due to memory constraints. Additionally, they can be computed at one pass over streaming data and when combined with map-reduce techniques can yield a system capable of compressing a stream of O(n) points using only O(log n) space and update time.\n\nProblem Addressed: Field-deployed sensor networks are collecting massive amounts of data in real-time across a wide range of applications, resulting in a great demand for systems that can support streaming and performing computation on this high frequency data. Methods that first store all the data from a given fielded sensor network struggle to analyze data in real time. Additionally, most analysis tools today are based on data mining algorithms that can only handle blocks of static data on the order of a few gigabytes, that fit in the internal memory. The Inventors’ approach employs coresets, which are small sets that approximately represents the original data, to achieve an efficient method of data compression. Running queries or fitting models on the coreset will yield similar results when applied to the original data set.\n\nAdvantages: Insertion time per new observation in coreset and required memory is only linear in both the dimension of the data, and the number k of segments. Approach achieves dimensionality reduction of very large scale sparse data sets by solving time and space limitations"

Specific uses include EUV lithography, x-ray microscopy, protein crystallography, and studies of ultrafast phenomena.\n\nTechnology: The invention emits coherent radiation by first generating and transmitting an array of discrete electron beamlets from a nanocathode array along a longitudinal axis. Subsequently, an array of electron beamlets is focused to reduce the spacing that separates the electron beamlets. The transverse-axis spacing of the electron beamlets is then transferred to the longitudinal axis via an emittance exchange beamline, creating a periodically modulated distribution of coherent electronic current. The coherent electronic current can then be directed into a stream of photons to generate coherent x-ray radiation.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current methods of x-ray generation include bremsstrahlung x-rays from a tube, inverse Compton scattering in either a small linear accelerator or via synchrotrons, and x-ray free electron lasers.

The inventors monitored multiple time dependent checkpoint signaling and response events with a high-content multiplex image-based RNAi screen of chromatin modifying and interacting genes and discovered that Brd4 inhibits DNA damage signaling by binding to acetylated histones at sites of open chromatin and altering chromatin accessibility. Brd4 knockdown cells displayed altered chromatin structure, prolonged cell cycle checkpoint arrest and enhanced survival after irradiation, while overexpression of Brd4 isoformB results in enhanced radiation induced lethality. Therefore, drugs that inhibit Brd4 bromodomain binding or mis-localize Brd4 can serve as a radio-protective agents while therapies that up-regulate Brd4 isoformB expression can be used to increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to DNA damaging treatments such as ionizing radiation and chemotherapy. Lastly, it was discovered that assaying the levels of Brd4 isoformB expression in glioblastoma, and potentially other cancers, can be specifically used to predict which patients will have a good response to radiation.\n\nProblem Addressed: DNA damage activates a complex signaling network in cells that blocks cell cycle progression, recruits factors involved in DNA repair, and/or triggers programs that control senescence or programmed cell death. Despite this signaling network’s critical role in cancer pathogenesis, it is not fully understood. While investigating the role of chromatin structure in DNA damage response, it was discovered that Brd4, a double bromodomain-containing protein, is an endogenous inhibitor of DNA damage signaling and may be used for cancer treatment.\n\nAdvantages: Prognostic indicator of DNA damage therapy response.

MIT,"Metamaterials Incorporating ""Smart"" Elements: Gyromagnetism in the Absence of a MagneticField",Case number: #15022,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/metamaterials-incorporating-smart-elements,"Devices using gyrotropic metamaterials, such as optical isolators and circulators, play critical roles in optical communication and computing technologies due to their ability to eliminate crosstalk and feedback.\n\nTechnology: The gyrotropic metamaterial structure includes chiral metamaterials, configured to form pairs of dipole structures. Lumped circuits with antennas are placed between the dipoles to change the polarization states of an incident polarized wave. This is done by producing Faraday-like rotation allowing for nonreciprocal propagation of the incident polarized wave. The lumped circuits comprise a structure that amplifies the power received by the incident polarized wave. In this way, the device uses metamaterials of “global” properties that display novel behavior for electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths longer than the size of each meta-material element, and the size of the spacing between the elements. This gyromagnetic power amplification is scalable to other wavelengths and grants the opportunity to synthesize exotic electromagnetic materials.\n\nProblem Addressed: Electromagnetic materials lacking local time-reversal symmetry, such as gyrotropic materials, are of keen interest and importance technologically. However, most natural materials that lack local time-reversal symmetry require strong external fields, and function only in a limited range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Ferromagnetic resonance requires lower intensity external fields but is limited to the GHz frequency range. Magnetized plasma and Zeeman splitting of optical diode transitions provide gyrotropy at optical frequencies -albeit, at a weak level with high biasing fields. These constraints, together with associated large absorption peaks, have so far prevented large-scale application of nonreciprocal photonic systems. However, the advent of photonic crystals and metamaterials enabled synthesis of artificial composite materials, possessing previously nonexistent electromagnetic properties, such as negative indices of refraction.\n\nAdvantages: Eliminates crosstalk and feedback in optical communication and computing technologies. Allows for reflection-free transport over large bandwidths in the presence of large disorder without large bias fields. Scalable to a variety of optical wavelengths"

MIT,Efficiently HHG-Based-EUV-Source Driven by Short WavelengthLight,Case number: #14077L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/efficiently-hhg-based-euv-source-driven-short,"Apparatus and methods for efficient generation of extreme ultraviolet (EUV or XUV) radiation based on high-order harmonic generation (HHG) are described.\n\nTechnology: This technology uses high order harmonic generation (HHG) driven by short wavelength driver pulses (400-750 nm) to achieve EUV radiation of energies up to 100 eV. Using a specific drive wavelength and specific interaction parameters, one can generate a desired EUV wavelength. The laser cavity in which the generation occurs enables multiple interactions of the laser pulse with the gas jet. The overall efficiency of the system is determined by the number of interactions between the laser pulse and gas, so the cavity can be chosen to ensure large boosts in efficiency.\n\nProblem Addressed: The lack of efficient EUV sources, especially at 13.5 nm (93 eV), is a roadblock for the development of EUV lithography in the semiconductor industry. The current sources for EUV lithography are either discharge produced plasma (DPP) sources or laser produced plasma (LPP) sources. For future technologies, it is likely that the source power requirements will increase beyond 500W, but current source demonstrations for DPP and LPP are below 50 W. Moreover, DPP and LPP sources are not coherent, making light collection problematic and inefficient. Finally, LPP, in particular, has the undesired effect of producing debris, which damages source optics. These problems make LPP and DPP unfit as standard sources for the future development of EUV lithography.\n\nAdvantages: Generated radiation is spatially and temporally coherent, which ensures precise control over wave properties.. Efficiency of the system is tunable by choosing a cavity with appropriate properties."
MIT,Metal-Organic Frameworks with Tunable Hydrophilicity for Water AdsorptionAppliations,Case number: #16317,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/metal-organic-frameworks-tunable-hydrophilicity-water,"The described method generates porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), consisting of organic compounds coordinated to metal ions, with tunable hydrophilic properties as water adsorbents. These structures have water adsorption properties suitable for heat-storage or heat pumping applications.\n\nTechnology: Therefore, the inventors have investigated the water adsorption behaviors of a novel set of MOFs containing pyrazolate­­-based organic ligands and other N-containing heterocyclic end groups reported to have exceptional water stability for applications in water adsorption-based heat pumping. Specifically, they have developed a new set of water stable Zn2+–pyrazolate MOFs, then post-synthetically oxidized the material with dimethyldioxirane to render the hydrophobic channel interiors more hydrophilic. The increased hydrophilicity of the chemically treated MOF materials results in changes in the water adsorption profile of the modified versus parent materials. Such tunability of the water adsorption characteristics of these new adsorbents is potentially desirable in water adsorption applications such as heat transfer, pumping and storage. Hydrophobic materials have low regeneration temperatures that can allow for the use of low-temperature waste heat or solar collectors as energy sources. Alternatively, more hydrophilic materials might function under more extreme conditions (i.e. provide lower cooling temperature and/or adsorb water at higher external temperatures) and/or achieve large water exchange capacities over a desired working pressure or temperature range.\n\nProblem Addressed: Metal organic frameworks are of interest as adsorbents in water adsorption-based heat pumps due to their increased water loading capacities compared to traditionally used materials such as silicas and zeolites. MOFs also allow for unprecedented control over their structural and chemical functionality. The water adsorption behaviors of the few water-stable MOFs containing carboxylate-based ligands, such as MIL-101 (Cr) and MIL-100 (Fe), have been studied in some detail. While they have evidenced characteristics desirable in heat pump adsorbents, they appear to be hydrolytically unstable in the long term.\n\nAdvantages: MOFs are energetically efficient and environmentally friendly. MOF materials can be accessed in large scale via a modular synthetic approach. Tunable hydrophobicity of MOFS allows for wide range of water adsorption applications"

MIT,Laser Speckle Photography for Surface TamperingDetection,Case number: #15585,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/laser-speckle-photography-surface-tampering-detection,"The Inventors have developed a laser illumination technique to detect surface changes in physical objects. This technology can be used in security and law enforcement scenarios to determine whether physical objects have been tampered with.\n\nTechnology: Laser illumination generates precise speckle patterns on a surface depending on the phase of the light wavefront. These laser speckle images encode phase information, depending on the constructive and destructive interferences of waves reflected at different points of the surface. This tampering detection technology leverages the fact that even small surface disturbances will affect travel distance and thus cause phase changes in reflected light, altering the speckle pattern visible under laser illumination. The Inventors take before and after images of the surface under laser light and can detect subtle contact by correlating the speckle patterns in these images. Because speckle imaging is highly sensitive to camera location and viewpoint alignment, the Inventors use a combination of computational rephotography and correlation analysis of the speckle pattern as a function of camera translation to provide a robust and reliable method to detect subtle surface contact.\n\nProblem Addressed: Object tampering is of concern for many industries across a wide range of applications. It is often desirable to determine if an object has been tampered with. However, the changes made are frequently too subtle to be perceived with the naked eye or by comparing before and after photos. To address this, the Inventors introduce a new imaging technique that combines computational photography and laser speckle imaging to detect surface changes that are indistinguishable in regular photographs.\n\nAdvantages: Mobile technology does not need to be present at the time of contact with the surface; ideal for situations where the surface of interest cannot be constantly monitored"

MIT,Copper Oxide Surfaces for EnhancedCondensation,Case number: #15479,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/copper-oxide-surfaces-enhanced-condensation,"Applications for this technology are found in heat exchangers for power generation and water distillation.\n\nTechnology: This technology related to scalable surfaces with nanoscale features that barely touch the droplets. The nanostructured pattern itself is made of copper oxide and forms on top of the copper tubing. The process produces a surface that resembles a bed of tiny, pointed leaves sticking up from the surface; these nanoscale points minimize contact between the droplets and the surface, making release easier. The nanostructured patterns can be made and applied under room temperature conditions and the growth process naturally stops itself. After the pattern is created, a hydrophobic coating is applied when a vapor solution bonds itself to the patterned surface without significantly altering its shape. As a result of this technique, droplets do not fall from the surface but actually jump away from it, thus increasing the efficiency of the process. The energy released as tiny droplets merge to form larger ones is enough to propel the droplets upward from the surface, meaning the removal of droplets does not solely depend on gravity.\n\nProblem Addressed: A variety of industrial plants depend on water vapor condensing on metal plates. To improve the efficiency of these plants, the key is to increase the condensers' heat-transfer coefficient. On a typical, flat-plate condenser, water vapor condenses to form a liquid film on the surface, drastically reducing the condenser's ability to collect more water until gravity drains the film. This acts as a barrier to heat transfer. The challenge is to remove this thermal barrier by removing the water droplets as quickly as possible.\n\nAdvantages: Increased nucleation density. Smaller structure length scales. Enhanced condensational heat transfer"
MIT,"Generation of Specialized, High-Value Cells and Tissues from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells by Recapitulating Early Embryogenesis Using Gata Factor-InducedEndoderm",Case number: #16205,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/generation-specialized-high-value-cells-and-tissues,"Engineering heterogeneous tissue from autologous pluripotent stem cells has huge potential in regenerative medicine and could potentially address shortage of donor organs and tissues. In addition, heterogeneous tissue could yield more predictive in vitro models compared to homogeneous organoids for functional genetics and drug screening.\n\nTechnology: The aim of the technology was to co-differentiate hiPSCs into cells of all germ layers, such that they can co-develop into a heterogeneous tissue mimicking the process of embryogenesis. Since ectoderm fate is the default pathway for differentiation, a symmetry break was induced by engineering a system to pulse the expression of Gata6, a master transcription factor that guides cell fate towards endoderm and mesoderm lineage. Gata6 was encoded under an inducible promoter and a lentiviral system was used to deliver the transgene in order to achieve heterogeneity in respect to the number of transgene copies received per cell, and consequently, expression level of Gata6. Since a threshold level of Gata6 is required to induce endoderm and mesoderm lineage, the system effectively creates a heterogeneous population of all three germ layers. With sufficient time in culture, paracrine signaling from cell populations results in an organized and heterogeneous tissue.\n\nProblem Addressed: Human embryonic stem cells (hES) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have opened up the field of developmental biology and regenerative medicine with access to in vitro model system for understanding development and differentiation, and developing organoids of different cell types. However, most of the technologies so far have focused on generating homogeneous population of specialized cells from a single germ layer, or mixing cells to generate a mimic of complex tissue. This technology utilizes genetic engineering to induce cells of all germ layers that co-develop to form heterogeneous tissue similar to the embryogenesis process.\n\nAdvantages: This technology describes a method of generating complex homeostatic heterogeneous tissues from hiPSCs that co-develop, mimicking the process of embryogenesis.. Heterogeneous tissues provide a better system for functional genetics and drug screening.. Heterogeneous tissues derived from autologous hiPSCs could potentially be used for regenerative medicine."

MIT,Wireless Communication Systems for Underground PipeInspection,Case number: #16059KJ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/wireless-communication-systems-underground-pipe,"This invention is a wireless communication system for underground pipeline inspection to detect leaks.\n\nTechnology: The inventors have developed a system to enable bidirectional wireless communications between underground in-pipe sensor nodes and an aboveground remote control center. Sensor nodes inside the pipeline are mobile and carried by robots. The wireless communication system includes mobile sensor nodes inside the underground pipeline, aboveground relay nodes deployed along the pipeline, a remote monitoring center, and some mobile communication network from a third-party provider. Sensed information can be transmitted from the sensor nodes to the remote control center, and control commands can be delivered from the control center to the robots and sensor nodes.  The robotic device used for leak detection is built on wheels that propel it along the pipe. It consists of a drum-like membrane that forms a seal across the width of the pipe. When the robot encounters a leak, the flowing liquid distorts the membrane and pulls it slightly toward the leak. This distortion is detected by a piezoelectric system consisting of force-resistive sensors, which wirelessly communicate information back to the aboveground relay nodes and remote control center to signal a leak.\n\nProblem Addressed: Pipeline leakages are not only wasteful and costly but also potentially dangerous, as leaking gas pipes can explode or leech toxins into the environment. Pipes are most commonly inspected for leaks from within (i.e. “in-pipe”). Ensuring accurate, real-time leak detection requires reliable communication both ways between a remote monitoring center and the in-pipe sensor codes.Developing a communication system for in-pipe inspection has proved challenging. Wired systems are subject to wire damage and limited sensor mobility. Wireless communication requires signals to travel through multiple media, including water, plastic, soil and air, to reach aboveground. Moreover, the in-pipe sensor nodes have a limited battery-based energy supply.\n\nAdvantages: Energy-efficient communications and prolonged network lifetime. Robotic system can rapidly and accurately detect leaks of just 1-2 mm in size. Highly affordable compared to existing systems of leak detectionImproved speed and sensitivity over existing systems"

Such devices have applications in areas including clinical diagnostics and treatment monitoring (e.g., manipulation of HIV viral particles or circulating tumor cells), as well as the construction of high-throughput taste and smell sensors.\n\nTechnology: The invention extends solution-based layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition to vertical aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) forests, resulting in 3D bulk nanoporous materials where internal surfaces are modified with molecular-layered coatings. Surface characteristics of the multilayer coating, including chemical functionalization, mechanical properties, and nanometer-scale texture, can be tailored in all three dimensions by adjusting LBL assembly conditions. Additionally, porosity of the bulk material can be controlled by varying the growth conditions of the VACNT scaffold. In combination, these capabilities allow HDnanomaterials to be used for simultaneous multi-scale and multi-physics manipulation of nanoscale bioparticles. Beyond microfluidic applications, HDnanomaterials can also be post-processed to produce nanocomposites for structural, energy storage, and other applications.\n\nProblem Addressed: The capability to recognize and isolate small bioparticles present at low concentrations in a fluid has significant utility in the diagnosis and management of diseases such as HIV and cancer. However, existing N/MEMS platforms are unable to access many nanometer-scale particles of clinical interest. Furthermore, previous attempts at nanoscale filtering are impaired by low flow rates as a result of low permeability. This invention overcomes these limitations by advancing on-chip bioparticle manipulation into previously unexplored length scales (e.g. HIV virus, ~100 nm) while retaining Darcy drag 4-5 orders of magnitude lower than existing porous materials.\n\nAdvantages: Achieves 10,000-100,000x reduction in Darcy drag over existing porous materials, enabling high-throughput filtering and other microfluidic applications. Extends LBL deposition techniques onto 3D bulk nanoscale features"

MIT,Split Peroxidases for Detection of Protein-ProteinInteractions,Case number: #16082,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/split-peroxidases-detection-protein-protein,"This technology is a novel split peroxidase-based system for the detection of protein-protein interactions and has applications in the fields of cell and molecular biology, drug discovery, and diagnostics.\n\nTechnology: Split peroxidase reporters, such as split horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and split enhanced ascorbate peroxidase 2 (APEX2), overcome these limitations because once the full-length peroxidase is reconstituted, it is a versatile catalyst that generates signal for a wide array of detection modalities, including fluorescence, colorimetric readouts, and chemiluminescence. Furthermore, the peroxidases can generate contrast through a reaction with diaminobenzidine (DAB), generating a polymer that can be visualized with nanometer resolution using electron microscopy, or they can be utilized for spatially restricted proteomic mapping through proximity tagging with the probe biotin phenol.This technology is based on the generation of a split-peroxidase system, where the peroxidase enzyme is split into two components that, alone, are catalytically inactive. Proteins of interest can be tagged with these peroxidase components. When distinct proteins of interest interact, the two complementary components of the peroxidase enzyme are brought into proximity. These components associate to form the complete, active enzyme that can catalyze a wide array of reactions, enabling diverse detection modalities. Split peroxidases can be expressed in mammalian, yeast, and bacterial cells.\n\nProblem Addressed: Split protein reporter systems have potential applications for research of cell signaling events, detection of interactions between different cell types, sensing of environment pollutants, quantification of biomarkers, and diagnosis of disease states, including allergies and infectious diseases. Most existing split protein reporter systems are limited in that they enable detection by only a single modality (i.e. fluorescent or colorimetric or chemiluminescent). Furthermore, many split protein reporters are limited in their sensitivity of detection, with each detection event generating only a weak luminescent signal.\n\nAdvantages: Readout from protein-protein interactions is highly sensitivity owing to catalytic amplification by the reconstituted peroxidase enzyme.

MIT,Solar Power Conversion System with Directionally- And Spectrally- Selective Properties Based on a ReflectiveCavity,Case number: #15823K,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/solar-power-conversion-system-directionally-and,"Solar energy is currently captured by two means – either by converting solar energy to electricity (photovoltaic systems), or by converting it to thermal energy (solar-thermal systems). The current technology enables both of these conversions to become more efficient, by using a reflective cavity to reduce energy lost through infrared radiation.\n\nTechnology: The current technology proposes a physical device capable of achieving angular selectivity. It comprises a circular vacuum enclosure with a solar absorber suspended at its center. Sunlight is able to enter through an aperture in the circular cavity, but infrared radiation emitted from the absorber is reflected back to it because of the cavity's geometry. This device can be optimized for energy efficiency by balancing the ratio between the diameter of the cavity and size of the aperture; using a sphere as the cavity as opposed to a cylinder; using a wavelength-selective solar absorber which has high solar absorptance but low infrared emittance; or using a material at the aperture that can transmit sunlight but reflects infrared emission back into the cavity.A device of this nature also creates an opportunity to increase the efficiency of photovoltaic systems. A solar-thermal upconvertor (which increases the energy of photons it absorbs) is placed at the device's center. The absorbing surface of the upconvertor faces the cavity's aperture, while the other side emits upconverted photons towards a photovoltaic cell. In this configuration, the entire device is able to channel both within-bandgap and below-bandgap photons towards the photovoltaic cell.\n\nProblem Addressed: In solar-thermal systems, a high temperature is needed in order for the solar energy to be efficiently converted into thermal energy. However, at these high temperatures, the amount of energy lost through infrared radiation is also high, reducing overall efficiency. Several strategies have been proposed to counter this radiation loss – one of which is the use of an angularly-selective surface, that can limit the angles at which infrared radiation can be lost from a surface, while still allowing a large angle for sunlight to be captured. However, physical devices for doing this have thus far not been proposed.As for photovoltaic systems, one major source of inefficiency is the fact that not all of the wavelengths in solar energy can be captured by a photovoltaic cell – a photon can only be absorbed if its energy falls within the bandgap of a photovoltaic material. This leads to what is known as the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit – where photovoltaic systems generally have a limiting efficiency of 31%.\n\nAdvantages: Significantly higher efficiency for solar-thermal systems (up to 90% efficiency, more than twice that of blackbody absorbers). Significantly high efficiency for photovoltaic systems (up to 76% efficiency, as opposed to SQ limit of 31%). Reduced requirements for optical concentration of sunlight, thus reduced cost of optics required"
MIT,New Ultra High Sensitivity Material for GasDetection,Case number: #16060J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/new-ultra-high-sensitivity-material-gas-detection,"The increase in harmful gas emissions, such as NOx, CO, and H2S for example, is a threat to public health given its negative impact on the human respiratory system even at low concentrations. This invention is a sensitive and selective sensor for NOx gas using SnO (stannous oxide) micro disks as the sensor element. The gas sensor could be used by automotive companies to accurately monitor vehicle NOx emissions and government agencies could monitor air quality in cities and emissions from chemical, petrochemical, and power plants.\n\nTechnology: This technology is based on monitoring changes in resistance of semiconducting oxides upon surface adsorption/desorption of gases. This approach is simple yet cost efficient. The technology consists of SnO micro disks as detection devices for NOx gas. The sensor element, stannous oxide, synthesized by a carbothermal reduction process, which is a facile production method enabling high productivity. Additionally, the disks are prepared from tin dioxide and carbon, both of which are abundant and inexpensive.The device is easily able to detect 100ppb per hour, a standard set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Additionally, the sensor response for NOx is 200-fold larger than for H2 and CO, and nearly 1000-fold larger than CH4, demonstrating high sensitivity and  great selectivity to potential interferents. These disks also have a fast response time, on the order of seconds, making them appropriate for commercial sensors, and presented great stability and reproducibility, allowing them to be produced using inexpensive and well developed technology.\n\nProblem Addressed: Detection of these pollutant gases at ppm and ppb levels, with high sensitivity and selectivity, remains a major challenge. Existing gas detecting technologies based on optical, gravimetric, and electrical approaches are too expensive and require complicated designs.\n\nAdvantages: Simple in design and measurementLow cost processing.

MIT,Non-Contact Voltage and CurrentMonitoring,Case number: #16022,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/non-contact-voltage-and-current-monitoring,"This technology measures magnetic and electric fields to non-intrusively monitor electrical voltage and current.  When coupled with a device that produces magnetic fields, this technology can also measure flow rates, such as water usage, and monitor industrial processes.\n\nTechnology: Tunneling magnetoresistive (TMR) sensors, which measure magnetic fields, are the basis of this technology. When mounted close to an electrical cable, the sensors can determine the electrical current and voltage flowing through the cable by measuring the resulting magnetic field. Feedback loops attached to the TMR sensors ensure that they operate within the linear regime for more accurate readings. If several wires are close together so that theur magnetic fields interact, such as within a circuit breaker box, the reconstruction algorithm can process readings from multiple sensors to accurately calculate the voltage and current flowing through each wire. As a non-contact method, this invention can be easily installed in pre-existing systems and can be calibrated without interrupting services. Furthermore, this invention can monitor any device that produces a magnetic field and is, therefore, not limited to measuring electrical current and voltages. When coupled with water flow meters, which often use permanent magnets to couple gears inside and outside the water pipe, this technology can measure water flow by tracking the permanent magnet's rotation. This provides a quick and easy way to add functionality, such as wireless communication, to existing flow meters.\n\nAdvantages: Non-contact monitoring of magnetic fields. Can give a wide variety of real-time data, such as electrical current, voltage, and water flow. Easy installation on existing systems while they are running"
MIT,Methods and Apparatus for Transparent Display Using Up-ConvertingNanoparticles,Case number: #16097,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/methods-and-apparatus-transparent-display-using,"Three-dimensional transparent displays in medicine, engineering, scientific research and development, oil and gas extraction, and entertainment.\n\nTechnology: This technology consists of transparent color displays with nanoparticles made with nonlinear materials and is designed to exhibit optical resonances. These nanoparticles are embedded in a transparent substrate, such as a flexible piece of clear plastic or acrylic. Illuminating the nanoparticles with invisible light (e.g., infrared or ultraviolet light) causes them to emit visible light in a desired pattern.\n\nProblem Addressed: A number of transparent display technologies exist, but none have gained widespread usage. By eliminating the backlight of a liquid crystal display (LCD), the transparency is increased, but only up to a transmittance of about 15%. An organic light-emitting diode (OLED) can also be made transparent, but OLED production remains costly and OLED transmittance is also limited (typically less than 40%). Electroluminescent displays have also been made transparent; however,  they have been limited to single colors. Recently, fluorescent films have been combined with ultraviolet (UV) lights to make multi-colored displays that are transparent; yet, intense UV sources are required due to the small emission cross sections of the fluorescent particles.There has also been progress in 3D transparent displays, but such technologies have remained either in the lab or in specialized facilities. Technologies based on revolving 2D displays suffer from image flickering. Stacking several 2D displays yields a quasi-3D display with a limited viewing angle that cannot provide true 3D image depth. At least one prototype of a volumetric 3D laser display has also been demonstrated, but it was a miniature device, and its production is very difficult to scale. To date, none of these technologies has yielded a 3D display that is practical enough for consumer use.\n\nAdvantages: Display true volumetric 3D images without special eyeglasses. Scalable to large display sizes"
MIT,Metamaterial Based THz-IRDetectors,Case number: #15018J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/metamaterial-based-thz-ir-detectors,"The invention is a device that detects radiation at microwave, terahertz, and/or infrared frequencies.\n\nTechnology: The invention is a device which contains a substrate made of a dielectric material or a semiconductor material and one or more resonator structures are disposed on the substrate. Each resonant structure consists of at least two spaced conductive structures. A local electric field enhancement in the substrate is exploited to produce a photo-induced conductivity response. This photo-induced conductivity response can be correlated to the power of the incident electromagnetic radiation and it can also be used to quantify properties of the electromagnetic radiation (including magnitude, spatial profile, polarization, etc.).\n\nProblem Addressed: Current terahertz sensing technologies are relatively insensitive, or have very limited bandwidth. In the field of terahertz or gigahertz imaging, poor sensors limit technological adoption of terahertz radiation in a variety of applications that can span industries including security and quality control. Current technologies result in time-consuming scans to measure spectral and spatial information, and they also use relatively expensive detectors. The invention will help overcome these obstacles to wide technological adoption of terahertz radiation techniques by offering a route to sensitive, low-cost, and room-temperature sensing of radiation in the gigahertz to terahertz frequency band.\n\nAdvantages: Room temperature operation. Many sensitive detectors for this frequency band need to be cooled to cryogenic temperatures. This invention may operate at room temperature, or temperatures reachable with thermoelectric cooling.. Fast response times. This invention creates a conductivity response similar to semiconductor photodiodes operating at near-visible frequency bands. As a result, response times can be orders of magnitude faster than thermal detectors such as microbolometers, pyroelectric detectors, and Golay cells.. Low cost. This invention may leverage standard semiconductor microfabrication techniques which promise low-cost volume manufacture."
MIT,System for Portable Body SurfaceAcquisition,Case number: #17269,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/system-portable-body-surface-acquisition,"This application is used for portable wireless 3D posture monitoring for back pain management, portable monitoring of 4D posture (3D + time) for kinesiology, injury prevention and injury risk detection in military applications, weight lifting, etc., artificial proprioception for non-rigid robots, and entertainment industry: avataring and on-field virtual reality gaming.\n\nTechnology: This invention presents a portable 3D imaging system that can acquire human body movement beyond rigid joint-angle measurement. Using an ensemble of orientation sensors (IMUs), this technology can capture non-rigid deformations of the body surface. The system is comprised of a tight-fitting textile undergarment with embedded MEMS IMU devices (each comprising a 3D accelerometer, a 3D magnetometer, and a 3D gyroscope), 3D video capturing devices for calibration, and novel computer algorithms. This is a high-performance training-based approach with high robustness and scalable accuracy.\n\nProblem Addressed: Existing commercial technology based on Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) for portable motion capture is limited to articulated rigid models (i.e., skeletons). IMUs provide reliable 3D-orientation measurements which can be interpreted in terms of rigid segments and joint angles, given a template skeleton model. However, the surface of a non-rigidly deforming object such as the human body cannot be trivially reconstructed from orientations. Existing methods sometimes simplify the surface geometry of such objects into piece-wise rigid geometries, which results in low accuracy in the resulting reconstruction. Other approaches combine orientation readings with other technologies that can provide absolute position information. Unfortunately, the combination of IMU sensors with other modalities to capture non-rigid movement tends to make the system cumbersome and impractical, as indicated by the lack of commercial solutions along this line.\n\nAdvantages: Portable wireless, markerless, cameraless 3D imaging of non-rigidly deforming human body surface. More accurate and robust than existing technology with scalable accuracy depending on the number of embedded sensors. Delivers real-time performance.

MIT,Array Directed Light-field (ADL) Display for AutostereoscopicViewing,Case number: #14370K,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/array-directed-light-field-adl-display,"This invention relates to 3D displays and more particularly to a display for autostereoscopic viewing. It is used to direct light to produce multithreaded, autostereoscopic, true 3D images and can also be used to capture 3D video or images. The display technology can produce true 3D images that show horizontal and vertical perspective without the need for special glasses and that are unique to each viewing location.\n\nTechnology: The array directed light-field (ADL) display technology includes an array of elements from which light emanates, the elements being rotatable about two orthogonal axes by microcontrollers. An eye tracker is provided for determining the location in three dimensions of at least one eye viewing the array. The microcontrollers, using information from the eye tracker, rotate the elements to mimic a concave surface to deliver light to the eye. It is preferred that the elements are mirrors and the display further includes a projector for projecting an image on the array for reflecting to the eye. The elements themselves may include means for generating light rather than reflecting light.\n\nProblem Addressed: Stereoscopic displays utilize glasses that must be worn to generate the stereoscopic image and the image viewpoint is unalterable. Autostereoscopic displays produce 3D images without specialized glasses but have limitations. Parallax-based autostereoscopic display technologies require the viewer to be seated at a particular location to produce the stereoscopic effect, which limits the number and orientation of viewers. Lenticular lens-based autostereoscopic displays suffer from reduced resolution. Present autostereoscopic display technologies can only produce horizontal parallax for multiple viewers, not vertical parallax. Vertical parallax can be accomplished only for a single viewer using eye tracking. The image is altered to produce the vertical parallax for the single viewer based on a known eye location, resulting in a distorted image for all other viewers.\n\nAdvantages: Produces true 3D images without the need for special glasses.. Produces less sound during operation.. Has a higher bandwidth.. Reduces visual motion blur due to smaller absolute motion.. The use of specular (reflective) mirrors simplifies the fabrication of the display.. Only a single projector is required, which reduces cost and complexity of the electrical/optical components in the system.. Reduces hazards associated with operation.. Requires only a thin planar operating volume rather than a large cylindrical volume."

MIT,Arrays of Miniaturized Plasma Sources Individually Regulated by VerticalStructures,Case number: #15764,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/arrays-miniaturized-plasma-sources-individually,"Miniaturized plasma sources are used in plasma processing equipment, plasma displays, avionics systems, and biological decontamination. Non-thermal plasmas are of importance in high-power lasers, synthesis of nanomaterials, and electromagnetic reflectors and absorbers.\n\nTechnology: A microplasma generator is made of elongated semiconductor structures in a spatially defined cavity. A microplasma is generated whenever a voltage is applied across the elongated semiconductor structure. A gate electrode lies adjacent to the semiconductor, outside the microplasma cavity, separated by an insulating material. This gate electrode is configured such that a saturation current is altered when the voltage is applied. A series of generators may be arranged in a way that applying a voltage along the longitudinal axis will generate microplasma within the spatially defined cavities.\n\nProblem Addressed: Plasmas are generally created by generating free electrons and ions through super-heating. However, in a non-thermal plasma, the electrons are significantly hotter than the ions and neutrals. This temperature distribution, in combination with high pressure, results in collision and radiative processes that are important in a wide range of applications and that would otherwise only be possible to attain at extreme environmental conditions. Previous plasma generators have been unable to produce non-thermal, high pressure plasmas in large volumes due to instabilities which limit their practical utility. Miniaturized plasma sources with vertical structures generate stable, high pressure plasmas in large volumes.\n\nAdvantages: Miniature plasma sources keep breakdown voltage low at atmospheric pressures.

MIT,Force Controlled UltrasoundProbe,Case number: #14088,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/force-controlled-ultrasound-probe,"Improved usability and diagnostic capabilities of ultrasound imaging.\n\nTechnology: This invention, a group of related cases, presents an ergonomic, handheld, force-controlled ultrasound probe for medical imaging applications. The device, which consists of an ultrasound probe mounted to a backlash-free ball screw actuator and driven by a compact servo motor, maintains a prescribed contact force between the ultrasound probe and the patient’s body. A control system, which combines both a position controller and a force controller, enables ergonomic operation by keeping the actuator centered within its range of motion and permits the repeated making and breaking of probe-patient contact. By controlling ultrasound probe contact force and consequently the amount of tissue deformation, the system enhances the repeatability, usability, and diagnostic capabilities of ultrasound imaging.\n\nProblem Addressed: In current medical practice, the ultrasound probe acquisition state (position, orientation, and contact force of the probe) is manually controlled by an ultrasonographer, and therefore, the acquisition state at any given time is not repeatable at a later time, making ultrasound imaging difficult to reproduce. This can lead to imaging variations; hence, clinicians may not be able to determine, for instance, whether a tumor has grown larger over time or the change is due to the variations in the acquisition state. In addition, clinicians performing a biopsy must pay attention to the ultrasound probe force, the image display, and the needle in hand, so additional challenges caused by fluctuating contact force can lead to incorrect placement of the biopsy needle. Controlling the acquisition state through real-time feedback leads to more consistent ultrasound images and safer medical procedures.\n\nAdvantages: Maintains a constant contact force between the ultrasound probe and patient’s body. Improved repeatability and diagnostic capabilities; eliminates image variations with controlled acquisition state. Easier to control & more user-friendly. Provides the user with visual and audio feedback, informing them of the position, orientation, and contact force of the device. Provides pushbuttons on the device itself, enabling the user to initiate events (e.g., data recording, zeroing the angle) without needing to interact with a computer; hence users can focus on the device rather than the computer screen.

It is non-conductive when immersed in conductive fluid environments, and it allows the battery to conduct normally when pressed upon by the electrode in a battery housing.Standard button batteries in conductive fluids form electrolytic currents that cause tissue damage and breakdown of the gasket separating the anode and cathode. Within hours of immersion, they begin to release harmful battery contents. In contrast, quantum tunneling composite coated (QTCC) button batteries do not result in damage or current loss. When immersed in a simulated intestinal environment, QTCC button batteries do not produce electrolysis and do not release the harmful battery contents. Hence, these QTCC button batteries, when swallowed, prevent the external current responsible for tissue injury and the leakage of harmful battery contents. Electromechanical characterization demonstrates that QTCC button batteries remain sealed from contact with conductive bodily fluids and require approximately twice the pressure supplied by the adult esophagus and gastrointestinal tract to conduct.  QTCC button batteries should drastically lesson or even prevent the button battery from short circuiting after ingestion.\n\nProblem Addressed: Every year in the United States, the accidental ingestion of button batteries impacts thousands of children as well as a growing number of senior citizens and family pets. These incidents contribute to approximately 4,000 emergency room visits annually.  Ingested batteries generate external electrolytic current and produce hydroxide ions which cause tissue damage. Additionally, the short circuit current in conductive bodily fluids damages the battery gasket, releasing toxic metals such as cadmium, lead, mercury and lithium. Once the batteries reach the stomach, corrosive and conductive gastrointestinal fluids further facilitate the release of the harmful battery contents, which poses both acute and long-term health risks associated with heavy metal ingestion.The most severe damage occurs when the battery is lodged in the esophagus, resulting in tissue damage that may cause vocal cord paralysis, esophageal strictures, esophageal perforation, tracheoesophageal fistula, aortoesophageal fistula, or even death.The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 and the Button Cell Battery Safety Act of 2011 were implemented to address this mounting health concern. Although some progress has been made by these safety regulations, improving the safety of batteries themselves has not been addressed. Hence, there is a need for a product that can circumvent the harmful consequences of ingesting button batteries.\n\nAdvantages: Can power most battery-operated devices without modification of standard battery housings. Markedly reduces the ingestion hazard of button batteries"
MIT,Scalable Synthesis of Sulfur Nanosponge Cathode for Lithium-Sulfur Battery with Greatly ImprovedCyclability,Case number: #16066,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/scalable-synthesis-sulfur-nanosponge-cathode-lithium,"This technology can be applied to lithium-sulfur batteries for energy storage.\n\nTechnology: Many lithium polysulfides are soluble in the commonly used electrolytes.  This means that much of the active material in the cathode can be lost to the electrolyte in just a few cycles, which severely limits the battery's cycle life.  Strategies to protect the sulfur from the electrolyte typically involve encapsulating the sulfur within a protective layer.  This technology takes the opposite approach and uses carbon black, commonly added to battery cathodes to improve electrical conductivity, as the base to construct a sulfur-covered nanosponge to drastically extend the life of the battery.  Test cells constructed from the nanosponge cathodes have achieved a discharge capacity of 290 mAh/g after 500 cycles at 0.2 C.The sponge structure preserves sulfur content in the cathode by reducing the surface area of sulfur directly exposed to the electrolyte.  The carbon also serve as a sieve that allows the small lithium ions to enter the cathode but prevents the larger lithium polysulfide molecules from leaving, effectively trapping the sulfur within the cathode and keeping it available for lithiation on the next cycle.  Additionally, the carbon base is mechanically robust enough to allow the sponge to expand and contract in response to volume changes during battery cycling to maintain good electrical contact with the sulfur active material.  This allows every part of the cathode to participate in the lithiation/delithiation process, maximizing the available energy storage capacity.\n\nProblem Addressed: Sulfur is cost-effective, non-toxic, earth-abundant, and has a high theoretical capacity when used for lithium batteries.  However, lithium-sulfur batteries typically have poor cyclability due to the active material dissolving into the electrolyte and mechanical damage to the cathode from volume changes during cycling.  This invention increases cycle life by slowing down sulfur loss into the electrolyte and by using a structure that can expand or contract in response to volume changes.\n\nAdvantages: Increases the cycle life of lithium-sulfur batteries. Low-cost, reliable synthesis method that can be scaled up for commercial production"
MIT,High Energy Density Semi-Solid Storage Electrodes and BatteriesThereof,Case number: #16204,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/high-energy-density-semi-solid-storage-electrodes-and,"Through this technology, flow batteries exhibit about 5 times the capacity of their conventional design. These improved flow cells can be used for applications ranging from load balancing to electric vehicles.\n\nTechnology: The design of these flow electrodes combines redox active solution electrodes and active solid electrodes, forming suspensions of the latter in the former. These suspensions are percolating networks in the flowable redox solutions created by diffusion-limited aggregation. This creates an “infinite current collector” network that allows the electrochemical reaction to be carried out throughout the volume of an electrode. These networks can be created with the storage particles and/or additive materials that are electronically conductive. This design increases the electroactive area by 103 while providing sufficient electronic conductivity and retaining flowability. Currently, reversibility limitations are attributed to thick layers of insulating lithium disulfide (Li2S2) and lithium sulfide (Li2S) on the electrodes. The greater surface area of this design allows an equivalent volume of Li2S2 and Li2S to deposit as a thinner layer, which reduces transfer resistance and increases reversibility.  For identical solutions, cell geometry, and electrochemical test conditions, the cell with nanoconductor suspension exhibits 5 times the capacity of the conventional flow cell design, and reached the theoretical capacity of the solution.\n\nProblem Addressed: Currently, the electrochemical reaction in flow batteries only occurs on the surface of the electrodes. This design allows the reaction to occur throughout the volume of the electrode, and improves the battery capacity and reversibility when cycled to include the precipitation regime.\n\nAdvantages: Increased flow battery capacityIncreased flow battery reversibility"

These images are captured while the eye rotates. Thus, different images are captured in different rotational positions of the eye. A computer calculates, for each image, the eye's direction of gaze. In turn, the direction of gaze is used to calculate the precise location of a small region of the retina at which the retroflection occurs. A computer calculates a digital image of a portion of the retina by summing data from multiple retroreflection images. The digital image of the retina may be used for many practical applications, including medical diagnosis and biometric identification.

MIT,Bacteriophage Host RangeEngineering,Case number: #16347,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/bacteriophage-host-range-engineering,"This technology has applications in antibacterial therapies.\n\nTechnology: Researchers at MIT have developed a new method for addressing the challenges faced in engineering bacteriophage host ranges.  First, mutations are inserted into the tail region of phage DNA with PCR while the rest of the phage genome is amplified without mutagenesis.  These DNA fragments are then assembled into a fully functional synthetic phage genome by transformation into yeast and amplified in yeast thanks to recombination with yeast artificial chromosome (YAC).  The resulting phage genome is extracted from the yeast, and then transfected into a bacterium where it resumes its life cycle and produces progeny with the desired mutations. This phage population can then be tested for host range specificity.  Using this method allows for systematically generating and selecting phage variants with desired functionality.\n\nProblem Addressed: Overcoming the development of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria poses a tremendous medical challenge. Whereas small molecule drugs have been the standard antibiotic for several decades, bacteriophages, or viruses that infect bacteria, could prove to be a viable alternative.  One significant challenge of bacteriophage-based therapy, is the specificity of each virus; thus, simultaneously targeting multiple bacteria in an infection would require a cocktail of viruses, complicating both development of therapies and increasing the associated regulatory hurdles.  One solution would be to engineer a single bacteriophage to target multiple hosts; however, current techniques for bacteriophage engineering are low in efficiency and throughput.\n\nAdvantages: Systematically modify bacteriophage genome for wider range of specificities. Allows for modifying bacteriophage in non-bacterial host. Efficient and versatile method"
MIT,T-Pharmacytes for the Eradication of Latent HIVReservoirs,Case number: #15960HJQ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/t-pharmacytes-eradication-latent-hiv-reservoirs,"This invention uses latency activation combined with a potent immune response to eliminate viral reservoirs for treatment of infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n\nTechnology: Drug-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) are coupled to the surface of CD8+ T-cells, creating drug-delivery effector cells named T-Pharmacytes by the inventors. These cells, with their intrinsic tissue homing patterns, will deliver LRDs into the tissue sites where infected cells reside, and promote sustained, high dosing levels in these tissues. This invention uses a superagonist form of the cytokine interleukin-15, IL-15SA, a LDR that is more potent and less toxic than the earlier discovered interleukin-2 (IL-2). IL-15SA released from pharmacytes will stimulate viral transcription in latently-infected CD4+ T-cells and effector functions of the carrier cytotoxic T-Iymphocyte (CTL); HIV antigen expression by the infected cell will trigger recognition of viral peptides by the pharmacyte CTL, leading to killing of the infected target cell. Antiretrovirals will be co-administered to block residual progeny virus. Retention of the NP-CTLs at sites of antigen recognition will provide a positive feedback loop leading to additional drug release in reservoir sites where HIV is detected.\n\nProblem Addressed: Infected resting memory CD4+ T-cells are thought to re-seed systemic infection after cessation of antiviral therapy making it difficult to cure viral infections like HIV. Cells in this resting state do not produce virus and thus neither die by viral cytopathic mechanisms nor are effectively targeted by the immune system. Latency-reversing drugs (LRDs) that induce HIV expression from and thus expose viral reservoirs have decreased cells harboring inducible provirus, but cannot successfully eradicate infection. Current strategies have failed due to the incomplete ability of LRDs to effectively reach reservoirs of virus in tissues and the insufficiency of virus reactivation or endogenous immune responses to eliminate infected cells upon transient latency reversal. This invention addresses these issues for improved treatment of latent viral infections.\n\nAdvantages: Efficiently eliminates viral reservoirs. Continuously targets tissues with infected cells due to positive feedback loop"

MIT,Larger-Area Single-Mode Photonic Crystal Surface-Emitting Lasers Enabled by the AccidentalDirac-Point,Case number: #15692,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/larger-area-single-mode-photonic-crystal-surface,"Applications for this technology are currently found in telecommunications, spectroscopy, laser printing, biological tissue analysis, and meteorology.\n\nTechnology: This invention exhibits a photonic-crystal surface-emitting laser (PCSEL) with an accidental Dirac point. PCSELs include a gain medium electromagnetically coupled to a photonic crystal; however, in this invention, the energy band structure exhibits a Dirac cone of linear dispersion at the center of the photonic crystal's Brillouin zone. Because the Dirac point is at the Brillouin zone center, it is called an accidental Dirac point. This is of great importance because tuning the photonic crystal's band structure (e.g., by changing the photonic crystal's dimensions or refractive index) to exhibit an accidental Dirac point increases the photonic crystal's mode spacing by orders of magnitudes and reduces or eliminates the photonic crystal's distributed in-plane feedback. Thus, the photonic crystal can act as a resonator that supports single-mode output from the PCSEL over a larger area than is possible with conventional PCSELs, which have quadratic band edge dispersion. Because output power generally scales with output area, this increase in output area results in higher possible output powers.\n\nProblem Addressed: Distributed feedback (DFB) lasers and vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) rely on one-dimensional feedback structures to provide relatively high-power, single-mode beams. Unfortunately, these lasers suffer from intrinsic drawbacks: DFB lasers and other edge-emitting sources tend to suffer from catastrophic optical damage at their facets, and the VCSELs' output powers are usually limited by their small cavity sizes.On the other hand, conventional photonic-crystal surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs), have a higher functionality than the previously mentioned lasers.  However, the lasing areas of PCSELs are limited by two fundamental constraints. First, the mode spacing decreases as the cavity area increases, which promotes multi-mode lasing. Second, the distributed in-plane feedback localizes the lasing fields to individual sections, which promotes multi-area lasing. Since the output power scales with the lasing area, these constraints limit the maximum output power of a single-mode beam emitted by a PCSEL.\n\nAdvantages: Increased orders of magnitude in photonic crystal mode spacing. Reduction in the crystal's distributed in-plane feedback. Greater output power and output area"

MIT,"Translating Text to, Merging, and Optimizing Graphical User InterfaceTasks",Case number: #13972,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/translating-text-merging-and-optimizing-graphical,"This technology is a method to enable multiple users to collaborate on automating computer tasks. It can additionally build a database of solutions for important computer tasks.\n\nTechnology: WikiDo builds a database of computer task automations based on crowd-sourced help from a community of Internet users. Users contribute by simply performing a set of instructions which are translated from a natural language (English) to a sequence of GUI actions. For example, the sentence “click on OK” will be translated to a GUI command LEFT_CLICK and an object BUTTON: OK on which to perform that command. As the commands are performed, the system aggregates traces from multiple users into a canonical sequence of GUI actions that, when executed on a user machine, can automatically perform the corresponding task. When a user searches the WikiDo database for a task they do not know how to perform, they can either read a text version of the GUI actions, use the solution as a tutorial that will walk them through how to perform the task step by step, or allow the solution to run automatically on their computer to perform the desired task. WikiDo achieves high-accuracy annotations for documents by merging multiple action sequences to filter out idiosyncrasies and mistakes of individual solutions. Additionally, a classifier is used to predict which steps are likely to be misinterpreted and requests human intervention to properly perform them. This process can be done iteratively until the translation is believed to be correct.\n\nProblem Addressed: As computers have gotten faster and more functional, they have also gotten much more complicated. This can prevent non-expert users from performing day-to-day tasks such as removing a virus or configuring their home router, leading them to spend large amounts of time with online technical help or drudging through tutorials that often fail to help them. While there exist expert-scripted programs that automatically perform a given task for a user, this is an often slow and expensive process with a limited repository of tasks. The Inventors have developed WikiDo, a system that allows lay users to automate computer tasks and contribute to a database of solutions by simply performing the task.\n\nAdvantages: WikiDo achieves nearly expert-level accuracy at a fraction of the cost. Database of available solutions grows as users solve new task. Tasks can be performed on a variety of environments and configurations"
MIT,Swirl-Counter-Swirl Microjets for Thermoacoustic InstabilitySuppression,Case number: #14110K,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/swirl-counter-swirl-microjets-thermoacoustic,"Combustion continues to be necessary for the world's energy demands, and irreplaceable within some domains of application. Combustion technologies are one of the most power-dense sources of energy, but the chemical processes involved lead to the creation and emission of pollutants. This technology will be useful in gas turbine design in the power generation and transportation fields by mitigating the emission of nitric oxides from combustors.\n\nTechnology: The invention provides a passive method for mitigating high-amplitude pressure oscillations within a certain window of operating conditions for a swirl stabilized combustor operating in the lean premixed mode. The swirl-stabilized combustor featuring Swirl-Counter-Swirl Microjets enables lean-premixed combustors to exhibit better stability by creating small ports through which secondary flow is injected immediately upstream of the combustion chamber. In existing designs, fuel and air are mixed upstream of a choke plate and the flow passes through a swirler before passing through a sudden expansion into the main combustion chamber. Swirl stabilization reduces the extent of the flame, measured along the longitudinal axis, compared to a bluff-body or expansion stabilized flame, allowing for the design of more compact combustors. Lean premixed combustion allows for a significant reduction in NOx emissions, making cleaner, more environmentally friendly combustors feasible.\n\nProblem Addressed: Even though combustors of continuous combustion systems have one of the highest available power densities, the chemical by-products of combustion are often undesirable pollutants such as nitric oxides. Nitric oxides, one of the major classes of pollutants emitted by combustors, are implicated in everything from environmental damage to global climate change. This technology substantially reduces nitric oxide emissions by using lean-premixed combustion, which in comparison to conventional non-premixed combustion is much better due to the improved mixing and lower flame temperature. However, lean-premixed combustion is very unstable due to strong pressure oscillations caused by a coupling of acoustics, flow field, and reaction zones within the combustor. This technology uses a swirl-stabilized combustor that uses microjets to reduce the overall sound pressure level and thus eliminates any coherent pressure oscillations.\n\nAdvantages: Compact. Environmentally friendly. Passive"
MIT,Recycling of Compound Semiconductor Photovoltaics by Means of AmbipolarElectrolysis,Case number: #14319,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/recycling-compound-semiconductor-photovoltaics-means,"The toxicity and scarcity of cadmium telluride (CdTe) have raised concerns over the use of CdTe in commercial products and have spurred a push towards finding a method to recycle those materials. This invention would be particularly useful in the photovoltaic industry where CdTe is a widely used solar material and for recycling companies focusing on compound semiconductors.\n\nTechnology: The invention provides a new method to recycle compound semiconductor materials used in the photovoltaic industry by employing ambipolar electrolysis (AE). The proposed process selectively dissolves the semiconductor material off the solar cell into a molten salt bath, leaving behind the glass and metal wire contacts. AE can then be performed on the molten salt containing the dissolved compound, resulting in the simultaneous electrodeposition of the two metals onto separate electrodes. To recycle CdTe, the molten salt can be CdI2 or CdCl2-KCl, and the operating temperature is 500°C. Given the high purity of the collected molten metals, Cd and Te products could be remixed under N2, producing CdTe, ready to be reintroduced into the manufacturing stream of new solar cells.\n\nProblem Addressed: The issues with the current technology are the toxic environmental impact of Cd and Te, which are widely used in solar cells, and the multiple steps required in the present recycling methods. The concern of Cd and Te toxicity pressures manufacturers to recycle spent solar cells and manufacturing waste. The proposed AE recycling of CdTe solar cells selectively dissolves the compound semiconductor for the reclamation of Cd and Te that are suitable for reentry into the CdTe manufacturing stream.\n\nAdvantages: Simple one-step process for the reclamation of Cd and Te. Continuous, closed-stream recycling where the products can be reintroduced into the manufacturing cycle. Shortens the recycling process. Recovers toxic materials"

Proteins are produced in situ via cell-free synthesis and directly immobilized on the SWNT/chitosan array, eliminating purification steps required by other techniques. Furthermore, protein-protein interactions are detected in a label-free manner. This invention uses a SWNT/chitosan microarray that optically reports binding of an analyte protein to the capture protein docked to the nickel complex wrapping the nanotube. This arrangement enables resolution of single protein binding events, the lowest detection limit of any protein array demonstrated to date.\n\nProblem Addressed: Protein microarrays are a developing technology that shows significant promise for drug development and protein detection applications. However, current protein microarrays suffer from a variety of drawbacks, such as relying on the use of antibodies for protein capture, requiring the use of a label or tag and limited amounts of purified proteins.\n\nAdvantages: Does not require labeling of the target analyte protein, which can perturb protein-protein interactions of interest. Suitable for any protein-protein interactions, not just antigen-antibody pairs. Capability to detect single protein binding events. Real-time detection. High-throughput detection of protein-protein interactions. Eliminates protein preparation and purification since synthesis is done directly on the array; thus it is simple and cheap"
MIT,Discretely Actuated SolarMirrors,Case number: #14333K,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/discretely-actuated-solar-mirrors,"Simple binary actuators embedded in a compliant mirror substructure can correct the shape of mirrors in solar collection applications (e.g. solar energy concentrators, large space telescopes) and increase the overall efficiency by optimizing mirror shape.\n\nTechnology: This technology has the actuators mounted to mechanisms with relatively rigid elements, creating a discrete positioning system. The actuators could also be attached to a large structure with members (i.e., support beams) having some significant elasticity. The structural members must be of sufficient compliance so that the actuators can apply enough force to switch their state and result in motions large enough to compensate for the undesired distortions. This system only needs to switch the polarity of the signal to the actuators to change states and can be applied to photovoltaic collectors or thermal solar collectors in addition to mirrors.\n\nProblem Addressed: Imprecision in mirror shape due to manufacturing limitations and disturbances degrades the performance of solar concentrator systems. Current technologies use continuous actuators to adjust mirror shape. However, continuous actuators require a large number of actuators, sensors, and motion control systems. Additionally, high precision motion control elements often fail in the hostile environments in which solar concentrators exist (e.g., space, deserts, and seaside regions). This technology is a system that adjusts mirror shape using only binary actuators embedded in a compliant mirror substructure.\n\nAdvantages: Simple, inexpensive, and lightweight system. Robust due to redundancy"
MIT,Several Inventions Related to Hydrogen Bromine FlowBattery,Case number: #16441,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/several-inventions-related-hydrogen-bromine-flow,"Flow batteries (also known as flow cells) are a type of large-scale energy storage that relies on the exchange of electrons in different electrolytes. The current technology provides a means of lowering the cost of flow batteries, as well as increasing their durability, by removing the need for an expensive membrane in their design. The technology described here can be applied to various flow battery chemistries, such as hydrogen-bromine, zinc-borine, lithium-oxygen and lithium-ion.\n\nTechnology: The current technology separates electrolytes by leveraging laminar flow, rather than using a typical ion-perm-selective membrane. This design makes it a """"membrane-less"""" flow battery, and allows the current technology to be far more durable than existing solutions.Different electrolytes are separated using a porous dispersion blocker. The blocker permits the flow of ions, but reduces convective mixing — thus ensuring separated, laminar flow of the different electrolytes. The structure of the porous channels through which the electrolytes flow can also be varied, helping to control their degree of dispersion. This has the added benefit of allowing electrolytes to be pumped through at different pressures and even different directions, which can optimize power output and utilization of the different reactants.\n\nProblem Addressed: To enable the electrical reaction in a flow battery, the electrolytes must be separated, while still allowing for ions to transfer between them. This is typically done using an ion-perm-selective membrane, which only allows certain types of ions to pass through the membrane in specific directions. This membrane is costly and requires frequent replacement, driving the overall cost of the flow battery beyond commercial viability for large-scale energy storage.\n\nAdvantages: Eliminates requirement for a costly ion-perm-selective membrane in a flow battery. Able to maintain a constant charging and discharging current of 0.2 A/cm2, thus retaining high voltage efficiency"
MIT,The VisualMicrophone,Case number: #16488,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/visual-microphone,"The inventors have developed a method to turn effectively any object into a visual microphone to enable the detection of sound from afar. Sound signals produce air pressure fluctuations that cause objects in the vicinity to vibrate. This method works by analyzing video recordings of these vibrations to convert them back into a corresponding sound signal. This technology is mainly applicable for military, surveillance or espionage purposes.\n\nTechnology: The visual microphone works by collecting and converting vibration data back into audio signals. This process is initiated when an input sound (i.e. the sound of interest) causes air pressure fluctuations at the surface of some object. These fluctuations cause the object to move with a certain pattern of displacement over time. High speed cameras are used to capture this movement on film at a rate of 1kHz-20kHz, and the ensuing video recording is processed by the Inventors’ algorithm to recover an output sound.The input to the method is the video of the object. It is assumed that the observed relative motion of the object is due to vibrations caused by a sound signal. The algorithm works to decompose the video input into spatial subbands corresponding to different scales and orientations. Local motion signals are computed at every pixel, orientation and scale. To recover the audio signal, these motion signals are integrated across all the scales and orientations and weighted by their amplitudes to generate a single global motion ID for the object. Various audio denoising and filtering techniques are applied to this motion signal to obtain a recovered audio signal.\n\nProblem Addressed: Remote sound acquisition has been of great interest in recent years for surveillance and security purposes. Existing approaches that reconstruct sound from the vibration of objects at a distance are active in nature, requiring a laser beam or pattern to be projected onto the vibrating surface. The Inventors have proposed a method of passive audio recovery that uses high-speed cameras to obtain vibration data from video footage. This process is desirable as cameras are not only cheaper and more accessible than lasers, but it is easier to capture surround sound with a single video camera than with multiple laser readings. Moreover, this method does not require vibrating surface be retroreflective and can therefore work with virtually any everyday object (potted plant, bag of chips, etc.).\n\nAdvantages: More cost-effective method of speech recognition than other existing methods. Does not require additional sensors or detection modules other than a high speed camera. Capable of producing accurate and efficient representation of surround-sound acoustics. Technology can be used to intercept wireless standards with high levels of security, eg., Bluetooth, by analyzing vibrations in headset"

The codes allow the original message to be converted into a symbol for transmission over noisy communication channels. Next, the receiver gets the noisy version of the original message and is able to translate the noisy symbol back into the original message by comparing it to a few highly probable constellation points.\n\nAdvantages: Provides an efficient method for data transmission. Allows for  error correction of messages over noisy conditions. Adapts to channel conditions and provides high speed data communication"
MIT,Synthesis and Anticancer Activity of AgelastatinAlkaloids,Case number: #16512J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/synthesis-and-anticancer-activity-agelastatin,"This technology may be used in treatment of a wide range of cancer types by inducing selective cell death.\n\nTechnology: The inventors have synthesized all six (–)-agelastatin alkaloids, as well as nine structurally-related alkaloids and advanced intermediates, to study the SAR of this class of naturally occurring products and determine the potency of their anticancer activity. Agelastatins exhibit a unique tetracyclic framework with four contiguous stereogenic centers on the carbocyclic C-ring. A synthesis process involving late-stage C-ring formation allowed for the creation of nine synthetic (–)-agelastatin alkaloids for a comparative study of all known (–)-agelastatins in their ability to induce cell death in U-937 (lymphoma), HeLa (cervical carcinoma), A549 (non-small cell lung carcinoma), BT549 (breast carcinoma) and IMR90 (immortalized lung fibroblasts) human cell lines. Overall, the compounds demonstrate selectivity for cancer cells, induce apoptotic cell death and arrest cell growth in the G2/M phase. These compounds are particularly active against white blood cancer cell lines, and the selectivity for these cells over normal cells suggests considerable potential as anticancer agents.\n\nProblem Addressed: (–)-Agelastatin alkaloids are a class of natural products that have been shown to have potent anticancer activity. Until now, there has not been a comparative study of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of all natural and synthetic (–)-Agelastatin alkaloids as it pertains to the alkaloids’ activity against cancer cell lines in culture.\n\nAdvantages: Concise and effective synthetic access to a range of compounds. Side-by-side testing of all known agelastatin alkaloids for anticancer potency. Potent induction of apoptotic cell death and cell cycle arrest. Activity against a wide range of cancer types, particularly white blood cancer cell lines"
MIT,Ultrasonic Shear-Wave Imaging for BiomedicalDiagnostics,Case number: #16424L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/ultrasonic-shear-wave-imaging-biomedical-diagnostics,"This non-contact laser ultrasound system (NCLUS) generates ultrasound images without making physical contact with the patient. It is an improvement upon current ultrasound applications in the medical setting such as bone imaging, traumatic brain injury detection, surgical guidance, internal bleeding detection, and bone health imaging. NCLUS is compact and lightweight, making it useful in field settings such as during combat or patient evacuation transport. The non-contact feature of the NCLUS makes it attractive for situations in which standard contact ultrasound systems would cause contamination or discomfort. For example, this system may be used to image injured body regions, open wounds during surgery, and in delicate procedures such as those involving the eye.\n\nTechnology: The NCLUS system utilizes photoacoustics to create a directed source of acoustic energy within the body. To accomplish this, it uses a pulsed near infrared source (Q-switched laser) to scan ultrasonic elastic waves at the speed of sound along a surface of the body. By moving the source of ultrasonic elastic waves at the speed of the propagating acoustic wave, the system creates a coherent directional wavefront to probe structures within the patient. The directionality of the NCLUS produces higher quality spatial information, reducing the distortion observed with contact sensing deformation. It also provides an amplitude that is significantly larger than that of current omni-directional techniques. This results in a penetration depth of a few inches rather than a few centimeters.The elastic waves propagate into the body and reflect back to the skin surface, where they are measured using laser Doppler vibrometry developed specifically for the NCLUS. These measurements can be processed to form an image of the interior body based on elastic wave impedance contrast.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current ultrasound imaging systems rely on mechanical transducers and receivers in contact with the skin where coupling gels act as an interface to reduce the impedance between the device and the skin. They produce images with inconsistent resolution due to the variability in operator hand pressure. The NCLUS limits operator variability by using non-contact ultrasound techniques to produce high resolution images.Additionally, current ultrasound imaging systems produce images by delivering photoacoustic energy in an omni-directional fashion. This yields two-dimensional images that suffer from a lack in resolution, and have a penetration depth of centimeters. The NCLUS delivers a very strong near surface wave propagating in a single direction along the surface of the patient. This allows for three-dimensional imaging, improved resolution, and a penetration depth of inches.\n\nAdvantages: Non-contact. Limits operator variability in hand pressure. Better and more consistent image resolution. 3D spatial imaging. Deeper imaging penetration depth of inches rather than centimeters. Safe for use on eyes and sensitive skin. Compact and lightweight, therefore useful in field settings"
MIT,A Synthetic Nanotube Antibody for Selective MolecularRecognition,Case number: #14090,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/synthetic-nanotube-antibody-selective-molecular,"Technology applications:\n\nIn vivo or in vitro sensors for biological detection\nTargeted carbon nanotubes for therapeutic applications\n\nTechnology: Molecular recognition and signal transduction are two central aspects and challenges to the design of sensor platforms. Natural antibodies are often used as vital components of sensors. However, antibodies are expensive, fragile and easily lose biological activity upon external treatment and exhibit batch-dependent variation, limiting their use. Moreover, certain biological molecules of interest don’t have a naturally existing antibody, including toxins, drugs and explosives. This has driven the search for methods to synthesize artificial antibodies from polymeric materials. SWNT photoluminescence (PL) has been used in sensor platforms for detection of DNA, divalent metal cations, genotoxins, reactive oxygen species and pH, among others. Yet, identifying methods to modulate SWNT PL in response to a specific analyte binding event remains a main challenge in sensor fabrication. Here, it is shown that a random polymer, with little or no affinity for an analyte, will adsorb in specific configurations to SWNTs such that the analyte will both bind to the polymer-SWNT complex and induce a measurable PL signal change. The polymer-nanotube complex can in effect act as a novel nanotube ""sensor antibody"".\n\nProblem Addressed: This method provides a solution to developing ""synthetic antibodies"" from synthetic polymers adhered to single walled carbon nanotube surfaces.\n\nAdvantages: For target protein or protein therapeutic detection there is no need to tag or label the target to enable detection as the SWNT complex binds directly. Works for small molecules and molecules with no known binding partner. Allows for continuous detection of the target analyte. Multivalent interactions between the polymer and the SWNT are possible ensuring higher efficacy. ""Synthetic antibodies"" may reduce development time compared to antibodies. Can also be used to deliver therapeutic molecules, ensuring directed drug release. Elucidation of in vivo reaction pathway because fluorescence is tissue transparent"
MIT,Biomimetic Superhydrophobic Surfaces Using ViralNano-Templates,Case number: #14176J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/biomimetic-superhydrophobic-surfaces-using-viral-nano,"Superhydrophobic surfaces have applications in self-cleaning of buildings, solar panels, vehicles, and textiles. Superhydrophobic surfaces can be used in drag reduction and increasing heat transfer rates via drop-wise condensation.\n\nTechnology: Superhydrophobic surfaces can be created using nanoscale features alone. However, naturally occurring self-cleaning surfaces (e.g. Taro plant, Myrtle Spurge plant, and the Lotus plant) exhibit hierarchical micro- and nanoscale structures. Through investigating this technology, it was realized that these hierarchical structures allow surfaces to retain superhydrophobicity under dynamic droplet impact (i.e. rain). Microscale pillars were created using a photo-definable polymer patterned onto a silicon substrate, followed by conformal self-assembly and metallization of the TMV. The final step is an atomic layer deposition of aluminum oxide followed by vapor deposition of trichlorosilane. However, the use of TMV enables direct patterning over a wide range of materials (including metals, ceramics, and polymers). The ability to use different materials allows broader applications of this technique. For example, if the application needs to be electrically conductive but also hydrophobic then a metal can be used.\n\nProblem Addressed: Hierarchical surfaces composed of microscale structures coated with nanoscale texturing have been fabricated using direct molding, etching, deposition, and growth techniques. However, this technology uses biological templates – the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) – for the guided assembly of inorganic materials, which has several advantages including simple and low-cost fabrication, structural versatility, and the ability to tune structures through genetic modifications.\n\nAdvantages: Simple and low-cost fabrication. Enables superhydrophobicity under dynamic droplet impact"
MIT,New Methodology for Functional MaterialsAerogels,Case number: #15342,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/new-methodology-functional-materials-aerogels,"Applications for this technology are found in aerogels, bio-scaffold, energy storage, thermoelectric catalysis, solar cells, and sensors.\n\nTechnology: This invention encompasses a new methodology to enable aerogel production with a wide range of materials. Colloidal suspension is initially uniformly dispersed with surfactant in solvent using sonication at low concentration, and evaporated slowly at room temperature so that it transformed into a more concentrated suspension with a large compressional volume change. As a result, the more concentrated suspensions of nanocylinders become gels consisting of 3D network of nanocylinders. The gels form at transition concentration between semi-dilute and isotropic concentrated regime and the resultant gels are washed to remove surfactant and then dried using critical point drier or freezing drier into aerogels remaining the gel network intact.\n\nProblem Addressed: Aerogels have numerous applications due to their high surface area and low densities. However, creating aerogels from a large variety of materials has remained an outstanding challenge.\n\nAdvantages: Gel can be formed from almost any material starting with colloid suspension of rod, nanowires, nanotubes, or nanosheet of material. Straightforward to develop aerogel material by extracting the liquid in the gel via CPD. Simple, efficient process that does not require proper precursors, reinforcements or supporting materials. Aerogels are extremely porous and ultrafine. Nanocylinders gels have perfectly interconnected 3D network, which results in good electrical properties"

An interferometer modulates the intensity of the broadband light source for a range of modulation frequencies. A bi-layer cantilever probe arm is thermally connected to a sample arm having at most two layers of materials. The broadband light modulated by the interferometer is directed towards the sample and absorbed by the sample and converted into heat, which causes a temperature rise and bending of the bi-layer cantilever probe arm. A detector mechanism measures and records the deflection of the probe arm so as to obtain the absorptance spectrum of the sample."

MIT,"A Series of Carbophosphate Compounds, Method of Synthesis and Their Application as Cathode Materials for Lithium IonBatteries",Case number: #13945,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/series-carbophosphate-compounds-method-synthesis-and,"High-capacity cathode materials have the ability to provide Lithium-ion batteries with higher capacities and longer life cycles. Industries focusing on manufacturing batteries and other electrochemical devices would benefit from using carbophosphates as cathode materials for Lithium-ion batteries.\n\nTechnology: Through electronic structure modifications, this invention uses phosphate groups to raise the operating voltage of a given transition metal ion. In some cases, phosphate groups increase stability by binding oxygen more strongly in the compound. The use of relatively light polyanionic groups, such as carbonate groups, with the presence of phosphate groups can lead to relatively higher energy densities. As a result, one can create lighter yet higher energy density lithium-ion batteries through the use of carbophosphate compounds as cathode materials.\n\nProblem Addressed: The demand for lightweight, high energy density batteries to power vehicles and portable electronic devices continues to rise. Although many compounds have been studied for use in batteries and other applications, it remains difficult to identify those compounds with the desired thermal stability and high energy densities. Accordingly, improvements in cathode materials in batteries and other applications are still needed. This invention uses polyanionic groups to create light, yet high energy density batteries to meet the desired energy demands while keeping manufacturing costs low.\n\nAdvantages: Compounds with polyanionic groups, such as carbonate and borate, are generally more stable than oxides and may release less 02 at elevated temperatures, an important safety feature for lithium-ion batteries. Lower- weight polyanionic groups may be useful for higher energy and power densities"

Above the limiting current, surface conduction inhibits growth in the positive membrane and produces irregular dendrites, while it enhances growth and suppresses dendrites behind a deionization shock in the negative membrane. The discovery of uniform growth contradicts quasi-steady “leaky membrane” models, which are in the same universality class as unstable Laplacian growth, and indicates the importance of transient electro-diffusion or electro-osmotic dispersion. Shock electrodeposition could be exploited for high-rate recharging of metal batteries or manufacturing of metal matrix composite coatings."

MIT,Oligocrystalline Shape Memory and PseudoelasticCeramics,Case number: #16062J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/oligocrystalline-shape-memory-and-pseudoelastic,"Shape memory and pseudoelastic ceramics have applications in mechanical actuators, mechanical couplings, armor materials, biomedical devices, and electrically controlled actuators.\n\nTechnology: Ceramic powders were made using co-precipitation methods followed by compaction and sintering to make a bulk polycrystalline specimen. Single crystal ceramic pillars were then fabricated using focused ion beam milling. Mechanical compression tests were carried out using nanoindentation techniques, showing pseudoelastic behavior with strains up to ~10%, stresses up to 1200MPa, and a damping figure of merit of 1.4.\n\nProblem Addressed: Shape memory ceramics rely on martensitic transformations which are similar to those found in more common metallic shape memory materials. Ceramics offer advantages such as higher operating temperatures and larger transformation stresses which exceed those found in metals. Previous polycrystalline shape memory ceramics have only shown recoverable strains up to ~1%. However, this technology uses an oligocrystalline regime, where the total surface area is greater than the total grain boundary area, meaning that grains are coordinated mostly by unconfined free surfaces rather than rigid boundaries with other grains, to achieve total transformation strain up to ~10%.\n\nAdvantages: Increased transformation strains.

MIT,Electrokinetically TreatingTeeth,Case number: #14863J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/electrokinetically-treating-teeth,"The numerous applications for this method include making normal enamel (sound, non-carious) caries resistant (by blocking diffusion pathways for cariogenic acid), enhancing tooth whitening, remineralizing teeth, and delivering dental therapeutics.\n\nTechnology: The technology described here has the potential to improve upon existing dental treatments, by facilitating the diffusion and transport of particles through nano and micropores using electrokinetic pumping. Electrokinetic pumping takes advantage of electrically-driven fluid flow to controllably and efficiently transport ionic solutions through a tooth’s enamel and dentin, allowing for penetration of up to 100 um into dental enamel.\n\nProblem Addressed: Teeth are composed of enamel, which contains nanoscale pores, and dentin, which contains microscale pores. These pores behave as channels that allow very small particles to flow through teeth. Current methods to whiten teeth and deliver nutrients to decaying teeth are limited by the small size of these dental pores. The most effective method available for overcoming this limitation is etching the teeth with acid prior to administering a therapeutic or whitening agent; however, this only increases the penetration depth of the enamel by 10 um. An effective method of delivering remineralizing, whitening, and anti-cariogenic agents to greater depths in teeth would solve both therapeutic and cosmetic challenges.\n\nAdvantages: Enables various molecules to infiltrate dental enamel.. Enables delivery of molecules previously considered to be above the critical threshold (MACT) to teeth."
MIT,Device for Trapping Hepatitis C Viral Particles in Ultra LowConcentrations,Case number: #14418J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/device-trapping-hepatitis-c-viral-particles-ultra-low,"An in vivo diagnostic device to sample large volumes of blood to trap hepatitis C viral particles in circulation.\n\nTechnology: This invention pertains to an in vivo device to sample large volumes of blood and trap HCV particles without the need to draw the blood. The device is placed in a vein via a catheter in an orientation that allows the blood to pass over and around the device as it flows. This device is coated with an antibody specific to HCV so that when a viral particle comes in contact with the device, it will bind to the antibody and become trapped. The device is then removed, and the number of viral particles quantified using one of the currently available in vitro diagnostic tools. In 30 minutes, this invention allows at least 40,000 times more blood to be sampled than a traditional blood draw, greatly improving sensitivity and efficiency of the assay.\n\nProblem Addressed: Proper treatment of hepatitis C (HCV) requires close monitoring of the viral load throughout the course of treatment. Many patients reach a point where traditional quantifying methods are insufficient to determine the viral load. The number of viral particles that can be captured with the current methods is limited by the amount of blood that can be sampled (typically between 1 ml – 3 ml) for each HCV test conducted. Because current methods cannot determine whether these patients fully eradicated the virus, they continue to receive the treatment for the full duration when many, in fact, can be cured with an abbreviated treatment length.\n\nAdvantages: Great improvement in sensitivity over current HCV diagnostic methods.. Allows physicians to safely shorten the duration of the standard hepatitis C treatment for patients who respond to the treatment quickly.. Highly improved sensitivity better segments the patient population, greatly improving the cost-effectiveness of the treatment."

MIT,HDL Probe2,Case number: #15787JR,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/hdl-probe-2,"Scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) inhibitors act as molecular tools to probe for the function of SR-BI in greater detail. Additionally, because of the known role of SR-BI in the transfer of cholesterol between cells and high-density lipoproteins (HDL), SR-BI inhibitors can be used to increase plasma HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration, which epidemiologic studies have shown is inversely related to atherosclerosis severity. SR-BI inhibitors could also potentially block cellular entry of HCV and malaria parasites that use SR-BI as co-receptors, thus, acting as potential therapy against HCV infection and malaria.\n\nTechnology: ML278 and ML279 are two of the inhibitors of SR-BI that were discovered in a high throughput screen. These molecules work by increasing the binding of HDL to SR-BI while reversibly inhibiting the transfer of cholesterol. ML278 and ML279 were shown to inhibit SR-B1 both selectively and potently in the screen assay with IC50s of 6 and 17 nM, respectively. It is important to note that these lead compounds showed superior potency in the screen assays compared to the clinical SR-B1 inhibitor ITX-5061.\n\nProblem Addressed: SR-BI is a member of CD36 superfamily, and is the primary receptor responsible for mediating selective transport of cholesterol between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and cells. The mechanism of this transport is poorly understood but it is known to be dramatically different from classic endocytic uptake. In addition to cholesterol, SR-BI can also interact and transport a wide variety of other lipids and ligands. Thus, there is a need for molecular tools to probe the biology of SR-BI further.There are multiple potential therapeutic applications of SR-BI inhibitors. In addition to its significant influence on lipoprotein metabolism, SR-BI has been shown to influence a wide variety of physiologic and pathophysiologic systems, including hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease, female infertility, adrenal insufficiency, anemia, thrombocytopenia, endothelial dysfunction, immune/inflammatory defects, susceptibility to deep vein thrombosis and association with some cancers.  In addition, SR-BI acts as a co-receptor for cellular entry of HCV and malaria parasites.  In some of these cases (e.g., HCV and malarial infection, cancer), targeting SR-BI presents an attractive approach to therapy.\n\nAdvantages: ML278 and ML279 are selective, reversible, and potent inhibitors of SR-BI. The lead compounds have superior potency compared to the clinical compound ITX-5061Inhibitors of SR-BI could be potential therapeutic agents to treat atherosclerosis and HCV and malarial infections."

MIT,Anti-Sigmas for Programmable TranscriptionalRegulation,Case number: #15523J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/anti-sigmas-programmable-transcriptional-regulation,"This invention enables better control of large genetic circuits in synthetic biology.\n\nTechnology: ECF sigmas (extracytoplasmic function) are similar to transcription factors and enable directed expression of target genes by recognizing specific promoters. Anti-sigmas are proteins that bind to specific ECF sigmas and serve to block their ability to direct transcription from target promoters. This reaction is highly specific due to high-binding constants.  The inventors have assembled a library of ECF sigmas and anti-sigmas, which, in conjunction with promoters, can dramatically expand the ability to design and construct large genetic circuits. The ability to both positively and negatively regulate specific parts of a circuit enables independent control of target modules and provides the ability to integrate multiple input signals to generate desired output. These novel genetic circuits are an effective mechanism to regulate gene expression.\n\nProblem Addressed: There are only a few well characterized transcription factors with which to program genetic circuits in synthetic biology.

The material is made into a powder through a co-precipitation technique. The powder is uniaxially pressed into disks and then sintered at 1500oC. The grain size is proportional to the sintering time (i.e. longer sintering time leads to larger grains). After sintering, single crystal pillars are made using focused ion beam (FIB) milling on individual grains. The resulting single crystal materials are able to undergo the phase transformations without cracking.\n\nProblem Addressed: Previous ceramic shape memory materials are polycrystalline, and during the shape memory effect, or pseudoelastic loading, the grains may change shape in opposing directions causing internal stress concentrations. This invention utilizes single crystal ceramic materials to overcome the stress concentrations found in polycrystalline materials.\n\nAdvantages: Ability to repeatedly undergo shape changing phase transformation without cracking or fracture.

MIT,PEG-Lectin Conjugates for MucinHydration,Case number: #15577,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/peg-lectin-conjugates-mucin-hydration,"This technology is a polyethylene glycol-lectin polymer that hydrates mucin in mucous layers. This invention has potential applications in mouth wash, soap, personal lubricants, eye drops, wound care products, and any other fields in which mucous layer hydration is desired.\n\nTechnology: Highly hydrated compounds such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) are normally strongly repulsed by mucin, making re-hydration of mucin layers difficult. Lectins, on the other hand, bind strongly to mucin. These inventors engineered PEG-Lectin fusions that have the hydration properties of PEG and the mucin binding properties of Lectin. The PEG-Lectin conjugate is able to restore hydration to mucous layers in both in vitro and in vivo models, and proved to be non-toxic in both settings. Importantly, the PEG-Lectin conjugates also greatly reduce colonization of yeast and bacteria in dehydrated mucin layers, demonstrating that the PEG-Lectin fusions restore both the lubricating and antimicrobial properties of hydrated mucin mucous layers.\n\nProblem Addressed: The mucous layers of the lung, digestive tract, eyes, female genital tract, and mouth are important for the hydration and health of the underlying cells and for preventing infection. Mucin is a highly glycosylated protein that forms a hydrated gel, and it is the protein primarily responsible for lubrication of mucous layers in the body As people age, these mucins can dry out, which leads to discomfort and increased risk of infection by bacteria and yeast.

MIT,Novel Recombinases and TargetSequences,Case number: #17809J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/novel-recombinases-and-target-sequences,"This invention is a method to identify serine recombinases for the manipulation of the mammalian genome. There are a number of specific applications including incorporating in an inducible positive or negative feedback loop allowing the monitoring and modeling of mammalian cellular behavior or the integration of peptides, RNAs, and proteins for enhanced controlled or continuous therapeutic expression.\n\nTechnology: This technology includes new large serine recombinases identified from recently sequenced mycobacteriophage genomes and a dedicated plasmid rescue system to identify the specific attB/attP recombination sites recognized by these recombinases. The ability of multiplex integration by using orthogonal sites could help to integrate a variety of different sequences, including circuits containing more than one sequence each, at different locations within a genome, which is helpful in preventing interference between circuits or attaining higher levels of expression. The inventors created a script to scan phage genomes and identify putative large serine recombinases as well as a suite of plasmids to enable the discovery of their recombination sites in their natural host and to transpose the system in E. coli and mammalian cells. The system was validated by identifying 26 new large serine recombinases from 400 Mycobacteriophage genomes, from which 4 were using new recombination sites.\n\nProblem Addressed: Programming mammalian cells with large synthetic gene networks can significantly facilitate elucidating complex regulatory cellular mechanisms, implementing new useful biological functions, and accelerating the design of novel tailor-made therapeutic treatments. Complex, stable, and heritable programming of mammalian cells by genomic engineering is limited by the requirement to pre-integrate a natural recombination site at single or multiple genomic (chromosomal) loci, thus necessitating the identification of programmable orthogonal (independently acting) recombinases that can be directly targeted sequentially or simultaneously to the endogenous sequences of choice in the mammalian genome. However, only a handful of these enzymes have yet been discovered and are extremely hard to engineer given the complexity of the site‐specific recombination mechanism. This technology includes the discovery of new large serine recombinases, shown to be the most promising ones in terms of efficiency and specificity for the manipulation of mammalian genomes, and procedures to identify more serine recombinases.\n\nAdvantages: Identify serine recombinases for varied uses in synthetic biology.. Can integrate a variety of sequences at different locations in the genome."

MIT,Concentrated Solar PowerSystem,Case number: #16037,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/concentrated-solar-power-system,"Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) refers to a method of harvesting solar energy, using an array of mirrors (heliostats) to reflect sunlight onto a heat engine in a central receiver. The heat engine converts the reflected thermal energy into mechanical energy, typically by heating a fluid to power a steam turbine. The technology here proposes a system of heliostats and a ground-based receiver that improves on the overall efficiency of existing CSP systems.\n\nTechnology: The current technology addresses these challenges by proposing a system configuration where the array of heliostats is placed on a hillside — the arrangement of which can be determined by this complementary technology (MIT Case 14620) — and sunlight is reflected towards a receiver that is buried in the ground. Elevating the heliostats in such a manner allows the angle between the sun and receiver to be optimized without having to raise the receiver off the ground. With the receiver placed in the ground, the system no longer needs to incur additional energy and costs to pump the heat storage medium around — instead, it is fixed in place in a tank, where the ground can serve as an added natural insulator. Additional features of this receiver can also allow it to store thermal energy much more effectively than existing solutions, as detailed in this complementary technology (MIT Case 16038). Instead of a fluid, this receiver can also contain molten salt, the composition of which can be designed to store a greater amount of thermal energy, as detailed in this complementary technology (MIT Case 13251).\n\nAdvantages: Leverages natural landscape to increase efficiency. Allows storage of excess thermal energy. Reduces financial and energy cost of circulating a heat storage medium. The overall system is lower cost and more efficient as a result"
MIT,Power Semiconductor Devices on ALNsubstrate,Case number: #15343,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/power-semiconductor-devices-aln-substrate,"This technology improves semiconductor structures, such as diodes and resistors, usually found in power transistors integrated in systems that rely on highly efficient converters. Applications for this technology involve cellphone amplifiers, satellite transition receivers, and high-efficiency electricity converters.\n\nTechnology: The invention is an AlN-based transistor device where carriers are confined using the polar nature of AlN. The polarization-induced electric field allows the conduction band to change in size, thus allowing the intermediate semiconductor region to be very thin. The thinness of the semiconductor layer causes carriers to accumulate within the region, and consequently creates electron gas within the device - producing an AlN-based field effect transistor. AlN-based devices reduce the thickness of conduction band gaps and lead to larger current densities compared to GaN-based devices. Several types of device structures utilizing AlN have been demonstrated with graded materials compositions, including DHFET (double-heterojunction field effect transistor) and POLFET (polarization-doped FET) devices. The graded composition prevents lattice mismatch within the different layers of the device. The graded POLFET devices exhibit a low threading dislocation density as well as a high current density.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current methods to fabricate III-V materials on Silicon (Si) substrate require a graded buffer layer, which adds to the processing requirements as well as introduces a potentially high concentration of threading dislocations. Additionally, the relatively low thermal conductivity and critical electric field of GaN limit the heat dissipation and breakdown voltage of GaN-based devices. This technology proposes the use of Aluminum Nitride (AlN) based devices due to its high critical electric field and high thermal conductivity relative to GaN. This allows for the creation of transistors that are capable of exhibiting higher breakdown voltages and lower on-resistances than transistors based on other semiconductor materials.\n\nAdvantages: High thermal conductivity. High breakdown voltage. Low threading dislocation density. High current density"
MIT,Optical Device for Detection of anAgent,Case number: #16122J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/optical-device-detection-agent,"Optical detection of chemical and biological agent, Portable agent detection\n\nTechnology: Employing ideas from detector arrays and imaging devices, the invention is an optical device for determining the presence of chemical and biological agents in the environment.

MIT,Hardware-Efficient Compensator for Outphasing PowerAmplifiers,Case number: #16207,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/hardware-efficient-compensator-outphasing-power,"Cellphone base stationsWi-Fi, Wi-MaxSetellite communication mm-wave short-range 60 GHz wireless70 GHz imaging and automotive radar\n\nTechnology: The invention outlines a set of design steps to implement these nonlinear predistorters for outphasing power amplifiers in a small area and a small power footprint while achieving throughputs well into the multi-Giga sample/sec range, which match and exceed the needs in radio, satellite, and general communications.\n\nProblem Addressed: High-efficiency, high-throughput outphasing power amplifiers are used today in a range of radio applications, from cell phone and Wi-Fi/Wi-Max base stations to satellite communications. To support the high-spectral efficiency required in modern applications, outphasing amplifiers need to provide a high degree of linearity, which becomes especially difficult in the outphasing architecture, due to the spectral regrowth of the signals in outphasing branches after the signal component separator. Careful study of these nonlinearities reveals compact compensator structures that are much more hardware efficient than general Volterra-type predistorters used today.\n\nAdvantages: Multi-giga sample/sec range matches and exceeds the needs in standard communications.

MIT,Reaction-Based Fluorescent Probes for Detection ofZinc,Case number: #16227,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/reaction-based-fluorescent-probes-detection-zinc,"The technology comprises a new class of reaction-based fluorescent sensors that selectively detect zinc ions in live cells. The invention can be applied to a variety of fluorophore scaffolds including fluorescein, coumarin, resorufin, and benzoresorufin. These probes could be used for applications such as live cell imaging, flow cytometry, and the detection of zinc in biological fluids.\n\nTechnology: A zinc-reactive protecting group is added to the sensor scaffold, thereby creating a non-fluorescent sensor precursor. Upon binding of zinc, the ester is hydrolyzed via a zinc-mediated process, resulting in a restoration of fluorescence.  This modification increases the dynamic range, reduces the pH-sensitivity of the metal-free state, and improves the efficiency with which the probes can be targeted to intracellular locales by reducing endo/lysosomal entrapment. These probes also offer improved solubility and can be applied to cells at lower probe concentrations than are typical. Furthermore, unlike most reaction-based probes, the zinc-induced fluorescence can be partially reversed in the presence of a chelator.\n\nProblem Addressed: Zinc is an essential nutrient. Chelatable or “mobile” forms of zinc can act as signaling agents, the actions of which have been directly implicated in numerous physiological and pathological processes, such as neurotransmission, neurogenesis, cancer, diabetes, and acute inflammation.  Understanding the role of mobile zinc in biology requires tools that can be used to visualize and track the changes of mobile zinc levels in diverse cellular and subcellular environments. Unfortunately, most commercially available small-molecule probes for mobile zinc have a narrow dynamic range, adventitious localization, and/or a pH-sensitivity, which limits their utility.\n\nAdvantages: A significantly improved dynamic range and pH profile.

The processes allows for a continuous array of sphere of diameters less than 500 nanometers to be fabricated internal to the fiber. One application is to use this technology on P and N type silicon cores. The process creates spheres which can be fused into bi-spherical silicon “PN molecules” which have been experimentally verified to have formed PN junctions.\n\nProblem Addressed: Silicon is an important and pervasive material in the field of electronics. However, there are no established methods for processing silicon into monodisperse spheres. The development of a versatile approach for controlled and scalable production of uniform silicon spheres would be an important breakthrough in the fields of mechanics, biotechnology, photonics and green energy.

MIT,Core-Shell Magnetic Particles and RelatedMethods,Case number: #14542,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/core-shell-magnetic-particles-and-related-methods,"Magnetizing substances, such as drugs or cells, is a method of removing them from various mediums. For example, magnetized drugs can be easily extracted from blood, while magnetized pollutants can be easily removed from water sources. This is done by attaching magnetic particles to the substances, which allows them to be easily separated from their medium by applying a magnetic field. The current technology describes a method of fabricating the attached magnetic particles such that they are more durable.\n\nTechnology: The current technology describes the development of a silicon dioxide shell around a plurality of magnetic nanoparticles (such as magnetite). The silicon dioxide shell would contain various functional groups (such as functionalized alkyl silanes) which are covalently bonded to the shell, and allow the overall particle to attach to other substances. Depending on the type of attachment desired, different functional groups can be chosen. The technology also describes methods of producing these shells, by combining an aqueous solution of magnetite, a reactive silicate and the functionalized alkyl silanes.\n\nProblem Addressed: The magnetic particles tend to lose their functionality over time, either due to loss of magnetization of the particles, or from being dissolved or oxidized by the aqueous solutions in which they are used. Methods currently exist to create a protective shell around a magnetic core, in order to increase the durability of these particles. However, such methods of fabrication are either cumbersome, or not applicable to a wide range of aqueous media. The current technology presents a variety of alternative methods to develop a protective shell around a magnetic core that overcomes these challenges.\n\nAdvantages: Uses synthetic functional groups that are less susceptible to biological degradation..

MIT,Portable Pneumatic Battery: Chemical Power Generation for Fluidic ElastomerActuators,Case number: #14771KJ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/portable-pneumatic-battery-chemical-power-generation,"Soft actuators fabricated from elastomer films with embedded fluidic channels offer a higher level of safety and adaptability in devices that rely upon high-performance actuators. Using a chemically-induced pressure source for power generation in fluidic elastomer actuators can be beneficial in applications including robotics, wearable tactile interfaces, and active orthoses or prostheses.\n\nTechnology: This invention uses a mechanical feedback loop to control the chemical decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to self-regulate the actuation pressure. Moreover, this technology uses a chemical approach to achieve portable and silent pressure generation. It specifically focuses on on-demand pressure generation by mechanical self-regulation of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into oxygen (O2). With a unique mechanical self-regulation mechanism, this chemical reaction is controlled to keep the pressure constant at a predefined value. The invention includes an elastomeric structure with embedded fluidic channels and a chamber enclosing a chemical monopropellant that acts as a pressure source. As the monopropellant is broken down by a catalyst to produce gas, the pressure will increase within the chamber causing air in the chamber to compress and pull a movable boss into the retracted position to cover the catalyst, thereby regulating the pressure within the chamber. Another key feature is its rotation-invariant usage, which allows the battery to operate in any orientation.\n\nProblem Addressed: In general, fluidic actuators require a pressure source, which is a convenient actuation source as it induces local deformation in a soft substrate. Pressure-induced actuators bypass the need for electrical energy and give a large actuation range limited only by the mechanical strength of the material. However, the need for a pressure source limits the mobility and mainstream usage of fluidic actuators. The current need to develop devices that rely upon new high-performance soft actuators while being low in stiffness and high in adaptability make chemically powered fluidic actuators favorable.\n\nAdvantages: Portable and silent pressure generation.. No emissions or harmful byproducts.. High energy density.. No need for high-pressure tanks."
MIT,"Lubricant-Impregnated Surfaces for Electrochemical Applications, Devices and Systems Using theSame",Case number: #17190,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/lubricant-impregnated-surfaces-electrochemical,"Lubricant-Impregnated Surfaces (LISs) can be used in a variety of applications from batteries to capacitor fabrication. For example, in flow batteries, controlled flow of the electrolyte and friction along the cell walls is very important. Introducing an LIS in this system increases controllability of electrolyte flow by minimizing the friction.\n\nTechnology: In order to form an LIS, first the lubricant must spontaneously impregnate the wall texture. Impregnation is, in short, dictated by the surface tension of the lubricant, surface tension of the solid, and the roughness of the solid. The solid is created through photolithography or chemical etching. For battery applications, the battery components (e.g., electrolyte, electrodes) must be substantially immiscible to establish a well-defined interphase with the lubricant. Additionally, the lubricant must be electrochemically and thermodynamically stable when mixed with any of the components of the electrochemical device. Using these conditions and methods, a lubricant impregnated surface is created and can be implemented in any electrochemical device where surface slipperiness is important. Finally, the LIS can be designed and selected to provide electronic or ionic or diffusional transport properties (e.g., LIS on a current collector, LIS on a separator structure).\n\nProblem Addressed: Controlling flow and slipperiness is important to electromechanical device function and/or manufacturing. For example, capacitors are manufactured by filling an electrode cavity with a flowable electrode. An LIS would lower the driving pressure necessary to flow. Previous methods for slipperiness in electromechanical devices focused on superhydrophobic surfaces. Superhydrophobic surfaces are composed of solid and air; however, LISs are composed of solid and liquid lubricant, which makes them more robust and self-healing.\n\nAdvantages: Increases slipperiness in electrochemical devices. Increases efficiency of electrochemical device function and/or manufacturing"
MIT,A MEMS/Piezoelectric System for Dual PressureSensing,Case number: #14742KJ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/memspiezoelectric-system-dual-pressure-sensing,"This device is a sensor with two different pressure probes packaged together to ensure greater accuracy of pressure measurements.\n\nTechnology: The inventors have developed a sensing system that includes a deformable diaphragm responsive to applied pressure and a rigid beam mounted to move as the diaphragm deforms. The rigid beam combines two pressure sensors in the same housing: a Fabry-Perot probe, which acts on optical physics principles, and a MEMS probe, which acts on electrostatic principles. This system ensures a more accurate sensor reading as both probes can serve to simultaneously check the other’s reading. Because the two probes act on different physics principles, they are affected by environmental conditions to different degrees. For example, if one probe is highly sensitive to temperature, the other will likely be affected to a lesser degree. Ideally, both probes should report the same recorded measure of pressure. However, if one or both systems are affected by environmental conditions then the two probes will report different pressure measurements, which would indicate an inaccurate reading. In this way, this system provides a real-time evaluation of the accuracy of its pressure sensors and offers a method to catch false readings immediately.\n\nProblem Addressed: A sensor is a physical device that detects a signal, physical condition, or particular chemical compound. Sensors are typically evaluated by their accuracy, which is their conformity to a standard or true value under a specified condition, and their reproducibility, which is the degree of agreement among repeated sensor outputs under the same conditions. In many situations, sensors are susceptible to environmental factors such as temperature and humidity which can cause them to lose accuracy. These factors can induce thermal and moisture drifting in the sensors, which can lead to mechanical problems such as adhesive swelling, and/or cause changes in the sensor’s electrical properties (e.g., resistance and insulation). Therefore, a system is needed for the real-time detection of inaccurate readings.\n\nAdvantages: Provides a method to evaluate the accuracy of sensor measurements in real-time.. Fabry-Perot and MEMS sensors can be configured in numerous ways to measure a variety of parameters.. Sensors are low-cost to develop by way of micromachining techniques."

Control pulses generate digital filters that extract information about the variation of the external parameter in the time domain and allow reconstructing its waveform. The system is implemented using a diamond structure that includes nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers for sensing magnetic and electric fields. An arbitrary waveform generator and microwave waveguides manipulate the quantum spins in the diamond structure using a plurality of coherent control sequences to measure the arbitrary profile of time-varying magnetic fields. A laser optically addresses the quantum spins in the diamond structure for initialization and readout.\n\nProblem Addressed: Quantum probes can measure time-varying fields with high sensitivity and spatial resolution, but existing measuring techniques are limited to the measurement of constant (DC) or oscillating (AC) parameters. Therefore, there is a need for a method of measuring time-varying fields with unknown dynamics.\n\nAdvantages: This approach provides accurate and efficient reconstruction in the time domain with minimal reconstruction error.

MIT,HDL Probe(BI-2012/024),Case number: #15788JR,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/hdl-probe-bi-2012024,"Scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) inhibitors act as molecular tools to probe for the function of SR-BI in greater detail. Additionally, because of the known role of SR-BI in the transfer of cholesterol between cells and high-density lipoproteins (HDL), SR-BI inhibitors can be used to increase plasma HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration, which epidemiologic studies have shown is inversely related to atherosclerosis severity. SR-BI inhibitors could also potentially block cellular entry of HCV and malaria parasites that use SR-BI as co-receptors, thus, acting as potential therapy against HCV infection and malaria.\n\nTechnology: ML278 and ML279 are two of the inhibitors of SR-BI that were discovered in a high throughput screen. These molecules work by increasing the binding of HDL to SR-BI while reversibly inhibiting the transfer of cholesterol. ML278 and ML279 were shown to inhibit SR-B1 both selectively and potently in the screen assay with IC50s of 6 and 17 nM, respectively. It is important to note that these lead compounds showed superior potency in the screen assays compared to the clinical SR-B1 inhibitor ITX-5061.\n\nProblem Addressed: SR-BI is a member of CD36 superfamily, and is the primary receptor responsible for mediating selective transport of cholesterol between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and cells. The mechanism of this transport is poorly understood but it is known to be dramatically different from classic endocytic uptake. In addition to cholesterol, SR-BI can also interact and transport a wide variety of other lipids and ligands. Thus, there is a need for molecular tools to probe the biology of SR-BI further.There are multiple potential therapeutic applications of SR-BI inhibitors. In addition to its significant influence on lipoprotein metabolism, SR-BI has been shown to influence a wide variety of physiologic and pathophysiologic systems, including hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease, female infertility, adrenal insufficiency, anemia, thrombocytopenia, endothelial dysfunction, immune/inflammatory defects, susceptibility to deep vein thrombosis and association with some cancers.  In addition, SR-BI acts as a co-receptor for cellular entry of HCV and malaria parasites.  In some of these cases (e.g., HCV and malarial infection, cancer), targeting SR-BI presents an attractive approach to therapy.\n\nAdvantages: ML278 and ML279 are selective, reversible, and potent inhibitors of SR-BI. The lead compounds have superior potency compared to the clinical compound ITX-5061Inhibitors of SR-BI could be potential therapeutic agents to treat atherosclerosis and HCV and malarial infections."

MIT,RNA Engineering for CRISPR Synthetic Circuits and EndogenousRegulation,Case number: #16876,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/rna-engineering-crispr-synthetic-circuits-and,"Various aspects and embodiments of the present disclosure relate to methods and compositions that combine multiple mammalian RNA regulatory strategies, including RNA triple helix structures, introns, microRNAs, and ribozymes with Cas-based CRISPR transcription factors and ribonuclease-based RNA processing in human cells. The methods and compositions of the present disclosure, in some embodiments, enable multiplexed production of proteins and multiple guide RNAs from a single compact RNA-polymerase-II expressed transcript for efficient modulation of synthetic constructs and endogenous human promoters.\nThe generation of robust, scalable gene networks that interfere minimally with endogenous cellular processes is fundamental to synthetic biology. The use of RNA regulatory strategies in combination with CRISPR/Cas transcription factors (CRISPR-TFs) allows for the conditional regulation of large-scale synthetic and endogenous gene networks in eukaryotic cells. The system is uniquely suited to build sophisticated circuits and transcriptional cascades that could be linked to specific events (e.g., cell cycle) or environments (e.g., chemical gradients).\n\nTechnology: Here we describe a genome editing toolkit for the generation of robust, scalable synthetic gene networks and native gene modulation in eukaryotic cells. Existing CRISPR/Cas methodology cannot be used for conditional gene regulation, as the guide RNAs (gRNAs) used to target DNA sites can only be expressed from RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) promoters, most of which are constitutively active. This technology produces gRNAs from RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) promoters, allowing for conditional gene expression and tunable responses to external inputs. The system integrates CRISPR-TFs with RNA regulatory machinery (e.g., Csy4 endonuclease, RNA triple helix) to produce functional gRNAs from RNAP II promoters while preserving downstream translation and expression of the harboring gene. The system is capable of multiplexed gRNA expression from one individual transcript, thus modulating multiple nodes from a single one and enabling sophisticated regulatory circuits with a large number of interconnections.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current methods for genome editing (e.g., CRISPR/Cas) have the potential to modulate gene expression in a tunable manner but are often limited by a combination of scalability, lack of conditional regulation, and inefficient regulation of endogenous promoters. This genome engineering toolkit provides the means to regulate and synchronize multiplexed, large-scale synthetic gene networks in addition to modulating endogenous gene expression.\n\nAdvantages: Multiplexed, large-scale genome engineering. Synthesize multi-stage transcriptional cascades. Regulate synthetic and endogenous networks"

MIT,"Covalently Functionalized Hydrogels on Oxygen Permeable Membranes for Stable, Scalable, and Xeno Free Growth of Undifferentiated Human Embryonic StemCells",Case number: #16162,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/covalently-functionalized-hydrogels-oxygen-permeable,"This invention is a novel oxygen-permeable method for xeno-free culturing of pluripotent stem cells, with applications in biomedical research and in clinical settings for stem cell-based diagnostics and therapeutics to treat various degenerative conditions.\n\nTechnology: This invention is a novel method for culturing pluripotent stem cells. The tissue culture dish is comprised of an oxygen-permeable substrate, which allows for modulation of oxygen partial pressure at the cell-substrate surface interface. Oxygen enters the substrate through surface facing away from culture media and cells. This modification eliminates the difference between the partial pressure of oxygen in the incubator and the cells in the incubator, enabling precise control over oxygen concentration in the cultured cells.The oxygen permeable substrate is coated with stable nanoscale matrices covalently functionalized to have a desired chemistry. The matrix can modify the surface chemistry of the oxygen-permeable substrate and allow for the facile, controlled, and stable attachment of biological molecules to the surface without adversely affecting the oxygen permeability. Functional groups and their density may be controlled during the coating process using a chemical vapor deposition process to generate the desired functional matrix, such as a hydrogel. This coating can mimic natural stem cell microenvironments and/or developmental processes. The inventors identified that altering the density of the functional biological molecules can either inhibit differentiation and maintain pluripotency or promote directed differentiation.\n\nProblem Addressed: Pluripotent stem cells are attractive candidates for a variety of cell-based based diagnostics and therapies because they are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into any somatic cell type. In vivo, stem cell maintenance and differentiation processes are regulated by soluble factors, partial pressure of oxygen, cell-substrate surface interactions, among other factors. The individual role of these factors in directing self-renewal or differentiation remains largely unknown. Conventional methods for culturing stem cells in vitro involve growing stem cells on irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or on Matrigel, a commercially available, mouse-derived, extracellular matrix-like substrate. These methods introduce xenogeneic proteins that do not allow for reproducibility of cell-substrate surface interactions since both Matrigel and MEFs vary from lot to lot. Moreover, these plating methods do not offer surface substrate flexibility to promote differentiation when desired. In addition, conventional cell culture methods cannot carefully regulate the partial pressure of oxygen in culture vessels, which has important implications for cellular health. Improving control over partial pressure of oxygen would facilitate the culturing of stem cells in physiologically relevant oxygen conditions. Accordingly, new methods for research and clinical uses that could more accurately model the stem cell microenvironment are needed for better in vitro stem cell maintenance and differentiation. The present technology overcomes the current limitations of stem cell culture practices by introducing precise control over partial pressure of oxygen on covalently functionalized hydrogels to enable stable growth and reliable differentiation of human stem cells.\n\nAdvantages: Enables physiologically relevant culture of pluripotent stem cells. Reproducible expansion of human pluripotent stem cells"
MIT,RNA Interference SpongeParticle,Case number: #14743,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/rna-interference-sponge-particle,"RNAi sponge particle (RNAi-SP) technology can be used in a variety of therapeutic settings where siRNA mediated-gene silencing is a viable treatment strategy.\nProblem Addressed\nIn recent years, RNA interference (RNAi) has gained interest as a powerful tool for suppressing gene expression. RNAi involves the intracellular delivery of double stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) which have sequences that target a gene of interest. Once inside the cell, these dsRNAs activate the RNA interference pathway to silence their target genes. The ability to safely deliver stable RNA into the cell continues to be a key challenge in the nascent field, and a new method such as RNAi-SP has the potential to greatly advance RNAi therapeutics.   \nTechnology      \nThis technology takes advantage of rolling circle transcription (RCT), an artificial nucleotide replication method, to synthesize concatemerized strands of cleavable RNA. The concatemerized RNA strands self-assemble into therapeutically deliverable sponge-like particles with a diameter of approximately 2 µm. The RNA is protected from degradation because it forms double-stranded structures within these particles. These nanoparticles can be reduced to a 200 nm diameter size through treatment with cationic polyethylenimine (PEI). Each particle contains approximately a half a million of cleavable RNA strands, which makes their delivery efficiency far superior to currently existing transfection methods. When these cleavable strands are introduced into the cell, they activate the RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) pathway to knock down intracellular production of any proteins of interest. Test trials on T22 cells have shown that RNAi-SPs can achieve the same knockdown efficiency as siRNA packaged by traditional liposome-based delivery methods at concentrations that are roughly three orders of magnitude less. Furthermore, the cells showed approximately 100% viability, indicating that the RNAi-SP delivery method exhibits low cytotoxicity. In vitro injection of RNAi-SP in mice have shown similar results.   \nAdvantages\n\nNew route for effective, highly efficient delivery of siRNA\nAbility to generate large amounts of siRNA in a form that assembles directly into a drug carrier that can be sued for direct transfections\niRNA is protected within sponge particle in the form of double-stranded polymeric RNAi\nBroad clinical applications with RNA interference"

Current treatment involves monitoring of glucose levels in the patient’s body. The basic glucose-monitoring device in use today uses a finger-glucose monitor and has certain disadvantages. These include pain associated with the finger stick and the discontinuous nature of the information provided. With such devices a patient must rely on few single-point measurements taken throughout the day to monitor blood glucose levels. As a result, there is a need for a real-time, continuous blood glucose monitor. Current in vivo sensors of biological compounds involve a sensor material that interacts with an analyte, forcing changes in absorption or luminescence properties upon exposure to a light source. However, these methods are expensive, require high resolution and involve use of bulky equipment.  In the current device, a single-walled carbon nanotube is combined with an analyte binding group, a glucose-binding protein or boronic acid, in such a way that the fluorescence or luminescence is altered when glucose interacts with it.  \nAdvantages\n\nContinuous, in vivo detection\nInexpensive compared to state of the art\nAvoids use of bulky equipment"
MIT,Variable Pitch SMT Assembly: A Method for Enhancing Fatigue Life of Ceramic ColumnGrid,Case number: #15549L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/variable-pitch-smt-assembly-method-enhancing-fatigue,"This invention can be used in electronic assemblies for the automotive, military, aerospace, downhole oil and mineral prospecting, wireless communications, video games, and computer industries.\n\nTechnology: This invention takes advantage of the facts that 1) interconnect columns are attached to lands on the bottom face of the part using standard eutectic solder;  2) that this solder melts at approximately the same temperature as the solder used to attach the part to the board;  3) that surface tension of liquid solder will center the ends of each column on the pads, top and bottom; and 4) that by tilting columns outward by a calculated amount in the highest strain regions of the part, fatigue life can be enhanced because compression/tension cycles are reduced by half compared to keeping those columns vertical at assembly.To effect this, the printed circuit board is designed such that solder pads in the highest strain regions of the part, in particular the corner regions, are skewed outward from the rectilinear grid and radially from the center of the part.  The board is then assembled using a conventional paste-place-reflow surface mount assembly process.  When the assembly is heated to reflow (melt) the solder, the surface tension of the liquid solder causes the columns to realign themselves out of the rectilinear grid and onto the desired pattern.The patent application describes one recommended approach to assembly that involves increasing pad thickness (by approximately 0.005”) in the central area of the device, while keeping the columns vertical in that region to provide stability during reflow; this provides clearance for columns in high stress regions to realign the desired tilted configuration.\n\nProblem Addressed: Repetitive thermal cycles, which are inevitable with many electronic applications, cause solder joints between large electronic components and printed circuit boards to fail due to strains in the joints that result from coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between the component body and the board.  Though this is improved by use of conductive columns between the part and the board, which introduce compliance, there is a need to further increase fatigue life in certain critical applications.\n\nAdvantages: This invention improves reliability of interconnects between large ceramic devices and printed circuit boards, particularly for large devices used in applications with large temperature swings. The approach uses standard commercial column grid array parts, vs. other solutions that require special column architectures and critical alignments. This design can be assembled using any conventional surface mount assembly process that is suitable for assembly of large ceramic column grid arrays"

This defect layer introduces Dirac cone dispersion into the fcc structure's photonic band structure.\n\nProblem Addressed: Currently, all proposed realizations of a photonic analog of graphene lack fully omnidirectional out-of-plane confinement, which has prevented creating truly realistic implementations of this class of systems.\n\nAdvantages: A feasible approach to achieve simultaneously quasi-two-dimensional light propagation and Dirac cone dispersion in an all-dielectric 3D photonic material. Unique light confining properties of a proper choice of 3D layered PhCs enables the creation of extended planar defect modes whose dispersion relation exhibits isolated Dirac points inside a complete 3D photonic band-gap.

The signature sets can be used to profile the stage of cancer as well as monitor the progression over time. Antibodies against proteins in these signature sets can also be used to target chemotherapy drugs to treat cancer or detectable agents to image the tumors.\n\nTechnology: Current invention uses quantitative mass spectrometric profiling of ECM proteins of non-metastatic primary tumors and metastatic tumors compared to normal tissue. This allowed for generation of signature sets of ECM proteins that are deregulated in tumors and also between different progression stages of cancer. These signature sets can be used to profile progression stage of cancer biopsies. Using antibodies targeted against the proteins in the signature sets, it is also possible to deliver conjugated agents such as imaging agents or chemotherapeutic agents for imaging and treatment of cancer.\n\nProblem Addressed: Large data sets of mutations, gene expression, and protein expression have been generated to understand the biology and progression of cancer with the hopes of identifying ways to treat cancer. However, understanding the role of ECM in disease progression using ECM as a way to target cancer has been mostly limited. This is because ECM proteins are insoluble and are crosslinked, thus, are intractable for large scale protein analysis. The current invention utilizes recently developed proteomic methods to identify ECM signatures associated with cancer and its progression, which can be used to diagnose, prognose, and treat cancer.\n\nAdvantages: Cancer-related ECM signatures identifies targets that are significantly enriched in tumors compared to normal tissue, which can be used to diagnose and prognose cancer.

MIT,High-Throughput Manufacturing of Nanofibers Using Massive Arrays of ElectrospinningEmitters,Case number: #16349,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/high-throughput-manufacturing-nanofibers-using,"Flexible electronics, Filtration systems, Tissue engineering, Ultracapacitors, Nano-reinforced composites, 3D printing of parts made of nanoporous materials\n\nTechnology: The presented technology overcomes the standard limitations of electrospinning by using arrays of externally-fed batch-microfabricated electrospinning emitters, demonstrating emitter densities as high as 25 emitters per square centimeter, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the state-of-the-art MEMS implementations. Further, the surface of the emitters is patterned to allow delivery of polymer solution without external pumping. The Inventors demonstrated four times more nanofiber mass flux compared to state-of-the-art commercial electrospinning nanofiber sources while operating at 92% less voltage.\n\nProblem Addressed: Electrospinning is a technique which generates nanofibers using strong electric fields applied to high molecular weight, polar polymer solutions. In the procedure, a high electric field deforms the free surface of the liquid into a conical shape. Then, the apex of the cone emits a charged fiber which undergoes a whipping process that stretches the fiber and greatly reduces its diameter.  Electrospinning is the only known process that can generate nanofibers of arbitrary length with controlled form, but the practical application of the resulting nanofibers is limited because of the low output of standard electrospinning sources.\n\nAdvantages: Technology drastically increases throughput production of electrospun nanofibers, decreasing their cost of production, and making them more available for low-end applications. Technology operates with 92% less bias voltage compared to the best commercial electrospinning nanofiber sources because of the microstructured emitter tips. Technology is modular and lends itself for implementing very large arrays. Technology is compatible with individual actuation of each emitter, enabling the possibility to use the technology to implement a printing head for high-speed, free-form additive manufacturing of nanoporous parts made of dielectric, semiconductor, and metallic materials. Technology uses capillary feed of the liquid, removing the need of active pumping and making the devices based on the technology resilient to clogging and with liquid feed redundancy.. The liquids used in producing nanofibers aver very viscous; therefore, having capillary feed greatly simplifies the liquid feed and reduces the power it consumes"
MIT,Transparent Laser Displays Enabled by OpticalResonances,Case number: #15813,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/transparent-laser-displays-enabled-optical-resonances,"Transparent displays have many applications, including head-up displays for cars and aircraft as well as displays on eyeglasses and glass windows.\n\nTechnology: This invention is the result of developing transparent displays that operate by scattering visible light from resonant nanoparticles with narrowband scattering cross sections and small absorption cross sections. More specifically, projecting an image onto a transparent screen doped with nanoparticles that selectively scatter light at the image wavelength(s) yields an image on the screen visible to an observer. Because the nanoparticles scatter light at only certain wavelengths, the screen is practically transparent under ambient light. Exemplary transparent scattering displays can be simple, inexpensive, scalable to large sizes, viewable over wide angular ranges, energy efficient, and transparent simultaneously.\n\nProblem Addressed: A number of different transparent displays have been developed, each suitable for a subset of the applications. The simplest type is the head-up display that projects into the viewer’s eyes through reflecting the image off a beam splitter. Head-up displays are well suited to certain occasions, but the narrow viewing angle limits the position of the viewer. Diffusive screens achieve wider viewing angles by light scattering; such screens do not have wavelength selectivity, so stronger scattering is necessarily accompanied by lower transparency. Frequency-conversion screens achieve higher transparency using molecules that convert the projected ultraviolet light to visible light ,or infrared light to visible light; the conversion, however, is challenging to implement with high efficiency. Instead of relying on projection, one can also make electronic flat panel displays transparent, for example by combining organic light-emitting diodes with transparent electronics. There is active research in developing this type of transparent displays, but scaling to large display sizes remains challenging.\n\nAdvantages: Transparent scattering displays can be simple, inexpensive, scalable to large sizes, viewable over wide angular ranges, energy efficient, and transparent simultaneously. Windows can be retrofitted with the film; therefore, there is no need to replace the window. The technology is compatible with existing commercial LED/laser projectors"

The fiber probes are made from polymer and polymer composites, and manufactured using a thermal drawing technique. Thermal drawing, the gold standard in optical fiber manufacturing, allows for fabrication of multimode optical fibers with a custom design that can incorporate a range of materials and functional elements. The fiber probes  have hollow channels for drug delivery, microelectrodes for neural stimulation and a core/cladding configuration for excitation and detection of optogenetic signals in the visible part of the spectrum.\n\nProblem Addressed: Research aimed at understanding the brain and nervous system’s activity depends on neural recording devices such as neural probes and implants.

MIT,Novel Terahertz SensingSystem,Case number: #14073L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/novel-terahertz-sensing-system,"This invention is a terahertz sensing system and its remote sensing applications, including explosive detection, vibrometry, concealed weapons detection, hyper-spectral imaging, and medical imaging. The sample’s composition can be acquired by analyzing the reflection, scattering, and absorption spectra in the terahertz region.\n\nTechnology: The invented system collects terahertz radiation scattered from a target and upconverts the collected radiation to optical frequencies. A frequency-domain spectrometer senses spectral components of the upconverted signal in parallel to produce a spectroscopic measurement of the entire band of interest in a single shot. The detected spectrum can then be used to derive information about spectroscopic characteristics of the sample. Because the spectrometer detects different spectral components of the measurement signal in a parallel manner, the system can measure moving samples and fast events.\n\nProblem Addressed: Detecting terahertz radiation is an extremely slow and difficult process, which is why a need exists for improved systems for and methods of sensing terahertz radiation. Also, prior systems with serial architectures are limited to detecting stationary objects.\n\nAdvantages: Can measure a complete spectrum once per pulse, resulting in much higher scan speeds (e.g., thirty times higher if the system measures thirty frequency components in parallel) due to its parallel architectures.. Can detect moving objects due to the ability to measure a spectrum on a “single shot” basis.. Can measure terahertz spectra at standoff, making them better suited to concealed weapons detection and other imaging applications."
MIT,Enhanced Light Interaction with Organic Molecules in Photonic CrystalSlabs,Case number: #15669,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/enhanced-light-interaction-organic-molecules-photonic,"Several applications for this technology are found in molecular sensing and detection as well as organic light emitting devices.\n\nTechnology: This invention depicts a system for stimulating an emission from at least one emitter, such as a quantum dot or organic molecule, on the surface of a photonic crystal comprising a dielectric substrate. This system includes a laser or other source that illuminates the emitter and the photonic crystal, which is characterized by an energy band structure exhibiting a Fano resonance, from a first angle so as to stimulate the emission from the emitter at a second angle. The coupling between the photonic crystal and the emitter may result in spectral and angular enhancement of the emission through excitation and extraction enhancement. These enhancement mechanisms also reduce the emitter's lasing threshold.\n\nProblem Addressed: Currently, the incorporation of organic molecules in optical cavities is challenging and often impossible due to the incompatible fabrication processing with the typically inorganic cavity structure.\n\nAdvantages: Ability to create more efficient organic light emitting devices.

MIT,Continuous Release of Cisplatin for Treatment of OvarianCancer,Case number: #15385J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/continuous-release-cisplatin-treatment-ovarian-cancer,"Applications for this technology are found in intraperitoneal chemotherapy for ovarian cancer.\n\nTechnology: This invention pertains to an implantable intraperitoneal drug delivery device for the treatment of ovarian cancer. This device can be implanted and removed from the peritoneal cavity through minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery. This approach eliminates catheter-related complications. This reservoir-based device works by allowing peritoneal fluid to enter the device and dissolve the powdered drug, releasing the drug in solution. Because the drug is in solid form within the device, the device is much smaller than would be the case if it were in solution. In addition, the stability of solid cisplatin is superior over cisplatin solution, which allows for maximum drug efficacy upon release even months after implantation.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current standard treatment for advanced ovarian cancer entails cytoreduction surgery to remove the bulk of the tumor, followed by intravenous (IV) or intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy with a platinum-based agent such as cisplatin. Direct IP administration of cisplatin into the peritoneal cavity reaches much higher levels of drug concentration compared to IV systemic delivery; however, more than half of the patients drop out of IP chemotherapy regimen mainly because of catheter-related complications. The incidence of catheter-related complications has limited the utilization of IP chemotherapy.\n\nAdvantages: No catheter; completely eliminates catheter-related complications. Implantable and removable via minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery. Superior drug stability. Maximum and long-lasting drug efficacy"

MIT,Microbial Production of 4-Methylpentanol fromGlucose,Case number: #16130,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/microbial-production-4-methylpentanol-glucose,"Branched, medium chain alcohols are as energy dense as petroleum-derived gasoline and have a superior octane rating. As such, they provide an environmentally sustainable alternative to gasoline for use in spark ignition engines. 4-methyl-1-pentanol (4MP), in particular, can also be used as an organic solvent for a variety of reactions and extractions.\n\nTechnology: This technology describes a method of metabolic engineering for the microbial production of branched, medium chain alcohols. The proposed metabolic pathway is composed of enzymes from multiple organisms and pathways, recombinantly expressed in E. coli. In one iteration of the process, two precursors (isobutyryl-CoA and acetyl-CoA) are generated from glycolysis, condensed to form a branched intermediate, and reduced to the final product, 4MP, in six steps. The pathway can be modulated based on enzyme expression to produce a variety of branched, medium chain alcohols.\n\nProblem Addressed: Economic and environmental concerns about petrochemical usage have led to increased interest in biofuels. Alcohols with medium to long carbon chains (C5 or greater) are attractive biofuels with a high energy density, but are not naturally produced in microorganisms. Previous metabolic engineering efforts have generally produced an insufficient yield for commercial purposes, especially due to large amounts of related byproducts. As yet, no large-scale production of 4MP in particular has been achieved. The novel synthesis route described within is capable of producing 4MP with high selectivity for industrial synthesis, and can be altered to synthesize a variety of branched, medium chain alcohols.\n\nAdvantages: Highly selective biosynthetic route to 4MP for large-scale production. Utilizes glucose as an inexpensive carbon sourceBranched, medium chain alcohols (e.g., 4MP) have a high energy density and improved octane rating. Branched, medium chain alcohols (e.g., 4MP) exhibit low water solubility, allowing for relatively easy post-production purification"
MIT,An RNAi-based Functional Genetic Approach to Drug Screening andCharacterization,Case number: #13883,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/rnai-based-functional-genetic-approach-drug-screening,"This invention is a means of identifying the mechanism of action of cell death-inducing small molecules. It may be used by drug development companies for the identification of drug targets and mechanisms of drug resistance for a particular small molecule.\n\nTechnology: This invention uses RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown genes known to be involved in mediating responses to a diverse set of chemotherapeutics, with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Cell-lines were then exposed to twenty common chemotherapeutics and their response monitored. The distinct set of shRNAs which promoted resistance and sensitivity for each drug were clustered to produce a functional array. Since drugs with similar mechanisms of action cluster together, the mechanism of action of small molecules may be defined. This approach has already yielded the mechanism of action of two poorly characterized drugs, apigenin and NSC3852 and has been able to characterize diverse platinum-containing compounds. Furthermore, it is highly reproducible, simple, and flexible.\n\nProblem Addressed: Pharmaceutical companies most commonly identify anti-cancer drugs with large screens for agents that cause cell death. Target identification of these drugs occurs later in the process and significantly hampers drug development especially when mechanism of action is never defined. Current methods to identify mechanism of action, such as microarray approaches, are expensive, lack reproducibility, and cannot efficiently differentiate between compounds that engage common downstream signaling pathways. Better understanding of mechanism of action would lead to target identification as well as insights into drug resistance. Combination chemotherapy also relies on multi-drug administration for cancer treatment with the goal of evading spontaneous resistance to single agents. Chemotherapy may be improved with greater understanding of mechanism of action for increased combinatorial efficacy of drugs.\n\nAdvantages: Simple and reproducible so that it can be performed by any laboratory with the appropriate vectors and cells. May be applied to a number of small molecules and combinations thereof"
MIT,Hydrogel Carriers for Monoclonal AntibodyCrystals,Case number: #21065J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/hydrogel-carriers-monoclonal-antibody-crystals,"Monoclonal antibodies are therapeutic molecules known for their high specificity and versatility in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disorders, but dosage forms are typically limited to low concentrations and large fluid volumes due to formulation challenges. Hydrogel microsphere formulations offer a route to quicker, patient-friendly dosing regimens for monoclonal antibodies with high loading and favorable flow properties needed for injection through a narrow syringe needle under moderate applied force. Crystals of an intact monoclonal antibody are prepared as a concentrated suspension (>300 mg mL−1) which is then encapsulated within hydrogel microspheres with diameters as small as 30 µm. The hydrogel microspheres contain up to 56 wt% (dry basis) monoclonal antibody and release within 4 days under in vitro dissolution conditions. The hydrogel microspheres are concentrated into densely packed suspensions containing up to 300 mg mL−1 monoclonal antibody to evaluate their flow. These hydrogel formulations shear-thin and have lower viscosity when compared to both liquid and suspended crystal forms of the monoclonal antibody, demonstrating the potential of hydrogel microsphere encapsulants as a carrier which can mask undesirable flow properties of concentrated antibody therapeutics."

A camera captures images of the back end of the fiber bundle. Because the fiber bundle is incoherent, the captured image is shuffled, in the sense that the relative position of pixels in the image differs from the relative position of the scene regions that correspond to the pixels. Calibration is performed in order to map from the front end positions to the back-end positions of the fibers. In the calibration, pulses of light are delivered, in such a way that the time at which light reflecting from a given pulse enters a given fiber directly correlates to the position of the front end of the given fiber. A time-of-flight sensor takes measurements indicative of these time signatures. Based on the map obtained from calibration, a computer de-shuffles the image."

MIT,The Design and Synthesis of Antifouling and Chlorine-Resistant Ultrathin Coatings on Reverse OsmosisMembranes,Case number: #16133,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/design-and-synthesis-antifouling-and-chlorine,"The invented Zwitterionic coating applied on commercially available RO membranes has excellent potential of providing chlorine-resistant, antifouling surfaces. This technology is very useful in the water purification and desalination industry.\n\nTechnology: The inventors have developed a novel antifouling chemistry that is also chlorine-resistant. The coating derives from poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP), which has been used as the precursor for antimicrobial coatings. P4VP is reacted with 1,3-propane sultone to obtain a zwitterionic chemistry with a balanced surface charge that minimizes the interaction with and thus attachment from various microbes. Divinylbenzene (DVB) copolymerizes with 4VP and renders the copolymer resistant to the oxidation of chlorine. The simultaneous use of chlorine (an extremely potent antimicrobial agent) and the chlorine-resistant, antifouling coating achieves much greater fouling resistance than that if one assumes additive effects between chlorine and the coating (namely synergistic effect). Ultrathin P4VP coatings are put down on commercially available TFC membranes via iCVD. Since surface tension and de-wetting are avoided, this all-dry process conforms to the geometry of the underlying substrate.\n\nProblem Addressed: Other antifouling coatings have been applied to various surfaces by processes that involve the use of harsh solvents. These solvents may cause damage to delicate substrate (such as RO membranes). The invented copolymer chemistry is the first-ever ultrathin (30 nm) and ultralow-fouling coating developed by initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD), a solvent-less technique. The ultrathin nature of the coating ensures unchanged productivity of purified water, because water flux decreases exponentially as coating thickness increases.  Additionally, while fouling from membrane use can be reduced by remediation with chlorine, exposure to water with even a few parts per billion chlorine significantly degrades normal membrane performance. This polymer coating is chlorine-resistant, lowering the number of additional processing steps and, in turn, operational costs.\n\nAdvantages: Ease of application, excellent control (of both coating thickness and chemistry) and surface conformance via iCVD technique. Solvent free and room temperature deposition process is unlikely to damage delicate RO membrane. Zwitterionic copolymer film provides ultralow biofouling surface. Chlorine-resistant coating enhances membrane maintenance"
MIT,Cytosolically-Active Peroxidases as Reporters for ElectronMicroscopy,Case number: #15128,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/cytosolically-active-peroxidases-reporters-electron,"This method enables high-resolution cell imaging, using either light or electron microscopy, of specific proteins or subcellular compartments of interest using a genetic tag.\n\nTechnology: Professor Alice Ting and colleagues have developed a tool that involves genetically fusing an engineered ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2) to a protein of interest to catalyze the production of an electron-dense precipitate that is easily visualized with either light or electron microscopy. This reaction occurs quickly and locally, thereby attaining very high spatial resolution. The tag is non-toxic and functional in all cellular compartments. Furthermore, it can be fused to fluorescent proteins, allowing for images from electron microscopy to be correlated with those from fluorescence microscopy.APEX2 has been demonstrated for EM imaging of a wide variety of cellular proteins in virtually every subcellular compartment. APEX2 is also useful as a marker of subcellular organelles. Although APEX2 has been most extensively used in cultured cells, it has also been successfully employed in a variety of model organisms, including C. elegans, Drosophila, mice, and zebrafish. See the references for details.\n\nProblem Addressed: Determining protein localization in intact cells while maintaining sample integrity is difficult. Traditional techniques involve antibody staining of target proteins, but the permeablization treatments required for antibody access compromise cellular ultrastructure. Alternative methods are limited by an inconvenient requirement for light and oxygen gas (which restricts their use to thin samples), or lack of activity in most cellular compartments.\n\nAdvantages: High spatial resolution. Excellent preservation of cellular ultrastructure with strong contrast on the target of interest. Can be used to combine multiple imaging modalities. Genetic tag is small, sterically compatible with most proteins, and functions in all cellular compartments. Can be used on samples of any thickness (reaction is not light-dependent).

If the sending node determines that the first network node stores the second packet and the second network node stores the first packet, it may code together the first and second packets to generate an encoded packet and may transmit the encoded packet over the broadcast medium.

These methods are excellent for a variety of crystalline host materials such as Y3Al5O12 (YAG), YAlO3, GdVO4, and LiYF4 (YLF). The upper-state lifetime is increased through carefully modifying the multi-phonon relaxation rate and avoiding concentration quenching. The multiplicity of lower state is resolved through increasing pumping intensity, sharpening absorption features and increasing the peak absorption strength. This laser is simple, efficient and boasts a small quantum defect, enabling excellent scalability to high average power with good beam quality.\n\nProblem Addressed: Tm-doped flurozirconate glass fibers are an excellent medium for solid-state lasing operations, which utilize the 3H4-3H6 transition. These fibers, however, are difficult to handle and fabricate. Thus, Tm-doped flurozirconate crystalline host materials are proposed as the ideal alternative. Unfortunately, these crystalline host materials suffer from short upper-state lifetimes and have multiplicity in their lower laser level. These combined effects ultimately increases the laser threshold.\n\nAdvantages: Decreased laser threshold. Excellent scalability to high average power with good beam quality. Long upper-state lifetimes. Simple and efficient. Small quantum defect"

We obtain output powers of up to 5mW and show lasing at widely spaced wavelengths within both the C- and L-bands of the erbium gain spectrum (1536, 1561, and 1596 nm).\n\nProblem Addressed: For production-level fabrication of integrated lasers on silicon, it is desirable to define the laser cavities using standard silicon processing methods. However, rare-earth-doped materials are incompatible with existing silicon production lines in semiconductor industry. Here we developed a highly beneficial process flow in which the erbium-doped layer can be deposited in a back-end manner.\n\nAdvantages: Up to 5mW of output power and shows lasing in both the C- and L- bands.

Using inductance tuning of the modulator transmission lines allows the matching of the optical and electrical velocities. The method keeps the characteristic system impedance at the optimal 50 ohms level, while allowing the length of the optical waveguide and transmission lines to be minimized. This ensures that the optical losses in the modulator are minimized. In addition, the waveguide, materials and fabrication process are specifically designed to reduce optical losses, while maintaining mode flexibility. Through decoupling the inductance and the capacitance of the microwave lines, a modulator was invented which minimizes the device length, optimizes the microwave transmission impedance and minimizes the optical losses.\n\nProblem Addressed: Electro-optic modulators take voltage variations in an electrical signal and transforms them into variations in the intensity and wavelength of light transmitted by an electro-optic material. Electro-optic modulators are becoming increasingly important in electronics and are constructed from microwave transmission lines adjacent to optical waveguides. For optimum system performance, the microwave and optical waves must travel at the same velocity, although traditionally, microwaves move through transmission lines faster than optical waves travel though waveguides.

To determine the clotting ability of a sample using this assay, a drop of blood is loaded on a microfluidic chip pre-loaded with various concentrations of a specific coagulation factor. After several minutes, the clotting status of the sample at each concentration is scanned on the chip. This assay can be used to test the presence of a particular novel oral anticoagulant by using a chip containing coagulation factors targeted by any given NOA. This could allow testing of effective NOA dose or could be used in a trauma care setting to rapidly test for anticoagulation drugs in an unconscious patient. Additionally, this same technology could be used to functionally test for congenital or auto-immune clotting deficiencies at particular points in the clotting cascade. Finally, this technology is rapid and simple enough to be deployed bedside, enabling on-demand monitoring of coagulation status.\n\nProblem Addressed: The delicate coagulation balance is critically important for circulatory function. Too much coagulation, and patients are at risk for stroke or heart attack, whereas too little coagulation can lead to uncontrollable bleeding. Anticoagulant drugs are widely used to prevent heart attack and stroke, particularly in elderly populations. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOA) have minimal side effects and have slowly been replacing more traditional anticoagulants, such as warfarin. However, the pharmacokinetics of these novel anticoagulants can be complicated and determining an effective dose difficult.

Graphene has emerged as a promising material for TCEs, because of its high transparency and current-carrying capacity, which surpass that of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), the most widely used TCE today. The present technology can be applied towards enhancing the performance of graphene as a TCE, which can thus improve the performance of organic solar cells. As a replacement for the increasingly expensive ITO, it also has the potential to lower the cost of organic solar cells.\n\nTechnology: The current technology proposes a method of applying PEDOT to graphene using oxidative chemical vapor deposition, where an unmodified graphene surface is exposed to a vaporized monomer and an oxidizing agent. This method involves a low temperature, moderate pressure and no use of solvents, meaning that the graphene material and its properties are not compromised in the process. The methodology can be applied to graphene films that have been fabricated either by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) or atmospheric chemical vapor deposition (APVCD).\n\nProblem Addressed: A critical factor in optimizing graphene as a TCE is reducing the energy lost between it and the solar cell's electron donor material. With ITO, this issue can be resolved by applying a conducting polymer known as PEDOT:PSS between the TCE and electron donor material. However, fabrication methods thus far have been unable to apply PEDOT:PSS to graphene without impeding its performance.\n\nAdvantages: Does not require any pre-treatment of the graphene surface.

Trimmable athermal waveguides leverage the photosensitivity of As2S3 and negative TO coefficient of polymers to address the fabrication and temperature sensitivities of Si based resonators. Constraints of TO resonance shift lower than 1.3 pm/K and trimming window of 5 GHz imposed by a 20 GHz channel spacing can been successfully satisfied by resonators fabricated with these waveguides.\n\nProblem Addressed: Silicon based ring resonators form an integral part of the WDM architecture of an electronic-photonic integrated chip. However, fabrication variations and temperature fluctuations alter the response of the optical filters. Active tuning involving heaters and thermo-electric coolers of these resonators have been proposed to keep the response within desirable limits, but these solutions prove power inefficient and the number of I/O lines limits the integration density, and thermal tuning energy constitutes a significant portion of the energy cost.Also, there is a shift in filter response of an athermal ring, which consists of a negative thermo-optic (TO) polymer cladding, which needs to be tuned back to its desired value due to fabrication variations.\n\nAdvantages: Minimum TO peak shift and high trimming resolution.

When a superconducting nanowire absorbs a photon, it switches from a superconducting state to a resistive state, producing a change in voltage that can be measured across the nanowire. A SNAP may include multiple nanowires in order to increase the fill factor of the SNAP's active area and the SNAP's detection efficiency. But using multiple meandering nanowires to achieve high fill-factor in SNAPs can lead to current crowding at bends in the nanowires. This current crowding degrades SNAP performance by decreasing the switching current, which the current at which the nanowire transitions from a superconducting state to a resistive state. Fortunately, staggering the bends in the nanowires reduces current crowding, increasing the nanowire switching current, which in turn increases the SNAP dynamic range."

Monomeric and dimeric ETP alkaloid derivatives were created by constructing compounds that varied in the substituents about the hexa-hydropyrroloindoline carboskeleton and the nature, extent and configuration of sulfuration. Sixty natural alkaloids and their derivatives were then tested for their ability to induce cell death in two human cancer cell lines: U-937 (leukemic monocyte lymphoma) and HeLa (cervival cancer). The most potent derivatives from this primary screening were tested in vitro against a panel of three supplementary human cancer cell lines: H460 (lung carcinoma), 786-O (renal carcinoma) and MCF-7 (breast carcinoma). Representative compounds from the monomer and dimer classes were shown to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis. The potent and broad anticancer activity of ETP-containing alkaloids suggests that they have considerable translational potential in treating cancer.\n\nProblem Addressed: ETP alkaloids are a class of natural products that have been shown to have potent anticancer activity.

On-site leakage detection cannot be used in the center of the pipe due to drop-off of the signal, so in this device there is a concentric ring pressure sensor that travels down the pipeline millimeters from the inner pipe surface, which carries electronics and communication devices.\n\nProblem Addressed: Water leakage can reach 30% on average of the water transported across the water distribution networks. Current water leakage detection methods can be expensive, time consuming, not accurate enough, have noise interference problems, depend on pipe material and the pipe location must be known. The widely used acoustic and noise correlators are not very effective with plastic pipes.\n\nAdvantages: The closeness of the sensor to the leak location enables capturing small leaks and makes the detection process independent of pipe material, depth and other environmental effects. Able to survey long distance pipeline in a network. Surveying portions of the network that are difficult to access by other techniques. The device can be remotely controlled inside the network"
MIT,Hydrate-PhobicSurfaces,Case number: #14446,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/hydrate-phobic-surfaces,"Hydrate-phobic surfaces can be used in pipes and fittings for deep-sea oil and gas exploration.\n\nTechnology: Van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding (Lewis acid/ Lewis base interaction), and surface texture effect the interaction of hydrates and surfaces. Therefore, by creating low-surface energy coatings hydrate adhesion can be mitigated. Low-surface energy is achieved with specific lattice parameters that induce a lattice mismatch with the hydrate layer and inhibit adhesion of the hydrate to the surface. Reducing hydrate adhesion prevents hydrate nucleation, which creates hydrate build ups and plugs.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current methods for hydrate mitigation are expensive, energy intensive, and environmentally unfriendly, focusing on the use of chemicals to shift the equilibrium hydrate formation curve to higher pressures and lower temperatures, using kinetic inhibitors to slow the growth of hydrates, heating the pipe walls, or managing the flow of formed hydrates. This technology creates a surface that prevents the adhesion and coagulation of hydrates by reducing the surface energy.\n\nAdvantages: Reduces hydrate adhesion in oil and gas pipes. Cost effective hydrate mitigation techniques"
MIT,2.5D CartoonModels,Case number: #14391,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/25d-cartoon-models,"The inventors have developed a method to bring cartoon objects and characters into the third dimension, by giving them the ability to rotate and be viewed from any angle. This has wide ranging applications, both in aiding animation and in enabling cartoon objects to be placed in an interactive 3D environment in which the user controls the viewpoint.\n\nTechnology: This method takes as input 2D vector art drawings of a cartoon from different angles that are referred to as “key views.” The goal of 2.5D interpolation is to generate an interpolated view that resembles a rotation to an intermediate viewpoint. To interpolate across the key views for each stroke, it is necessary to determine the appearance of a stroke in a novel view. For this, the stroke’s shape, position, and Z-ordering must be determined. The core realization of the Inventors’ approach is that these challenges can be separated, and tackled with different tools. A stroke’s shape can be approximated well by simple 2D interpolation, while its positions and Z-ordering are essentially 3D properties and can be easily modeled by the motion of a single 3D point associated with its 2D vector stroke. In general, this structure can be conceptualized as a collection of billboards positioned in 3D space, with each billboard containing a single stroke of the cartoon. To simulate a rotation between known key views, the billboards’ positions are rotated in 3D about the origin, while the vector art on the billboards is interpolated with simple 2D interpolation. The result is a 2.5D cartoon that retains the 2D, hand-drawn nature of the input vector art, while supporting full 3D rotation.\n\nProblem Addressed: Previously, cartoon rotation has been achieved by constructing a 3D model of the cartoon and rendering it in a non-photorealistic way so as to resemble a cartoon. However, generating a 3D model is time-consuming, and many stylistic elements of 2D drawings cannot be adequately reproduced in a 3D model. The inventors have developed a method to use 2D vector art drawings of a cartoon from different angles to generate a novel structure, the 2.5D cartoon model, which can be used to simulate 3D rotations and generate plausible renderings of the cartoon from any view. 2.5D cartoon models are easier to create and retain the 2D nature of hand-drawn vector art, supporting a wide range of stylizations that need not correspond to any real 3D shape.\n\nAdvantages: Cartoons retain stylistic nature of 2D hand-drawn vector art. 2.5D models can be rotated despite having no explicit 3D polygonal mesh. Only 3-4 key views are required to generate rotations and renderings in any orientation. Cheaper method for 3D rendering"

This extraction procedure and machine learning is then used to derive improved versions of state-of-the-art electrocardiographic (ECG) risk metrics for better cardiovascular risk stratification after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS).  We demonstrate that our method works on different characteristics of interest, such as ECG morphology and heart rate.  The methods presented in this invention have potential utility in predicting the occurrence of other adverse outcomes and using other quasi-periodic physiological signals.\n\nProblem Addressed: The ability to extract predictive features from physiological signals is important because millions of acute coronary events occur each year in the United States alone, resulting in 1 out of 6 deaths in the US.  Further, 8–19% of those Americans who had a heart attack will die within 12 months of discharge from the hospital.  Unfortunately, existing risk score matrices, such as Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI), only identify a subset of high-risk patients, and a significant number of deaths will occur in populations that are not traditionally considered to be high risk.  Hence, there is a need for tools to discriminate risks further.\n\nAdvantages: Improved cardiovascular risk stratification after an acute cardiac event. Applicable in predicting other adverse outcomes and using other signals"

MIT,Variable ThermalResistance,Case number: #17827L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/variable-thermal-resistance,"Electrical and electromechanical devices often require maintaining a specific temperature, or a narrow range or temperatures, during operation. An assembly regulates the temperature of a device by providing a variable thermal resistance between the device and a heatsink. The device can be mounted to a base having a high thermal resistance, the base thermally isolating the device from the heatsink. At low environmental temperatures, the base enables the device to rise to its operating temperature as a result of the device's waste heat, and with no or minimal use of a heater. As the environmental temperature increases, a working fluid, having a low thermal resistance, undergoes thermal expansion to fill a portion of a volume in the base between the device and the heat sink, lowering the thermal resistance between the device and the heatsink to maintain the device at the required operating temperature."
MIT,Reconfigurable WDM OpticalReceiver,Case number: #17727L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/reconfigurable-wdm-optical-receiver,"An optical receiver includes a cascade of optical filtering elements, each of which selects spectral components from incoming optical signals at a wavelengths aligned to filter passbands. The selected spectral components may be optically combined to form k pairs of intermediary signals, where k=log2(M). By comparing the k pairs of intermediary signals, k bits of a digital signal representing the incident signal may be generated. The filtering elements may be configured to perform demultiplexing and demodulation simultaneously, increasing functionality and reducing excess losses. The filtering elements may also be tuned so that the optical receiver may be reconfigured to accommodate different combinations of wavelengths and modulation formats, such as wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) on off keying (OOK), M-ary orthogonal formats including frequency shift keying (FSK) and pulse position modulation (PPM), differential phase shift keying, and hybrid combinations—providing rate and format flexibility and WDM scalability."

MIT,Multilayer Porous Hydrogel for Robust Sensing of Macromolecules with Florescent Carbon NanotubeSensors,Case number: #15892,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/multilayer-porous-hydrogel-robust-sensing,"This device, in the form of single-walled fluorescent carbon nanotubes embedded in a hydrogel matrix, can be used as a sensor for analyte detection or for drug delivery.\n\nTechnology: Individually dispersed, semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) exhibit near-infrared (nIR) photoluminescence (PL). Previously, selective modulation of SWNT PL has been demonstrated in response to glucose, divalent metal cations, DNA hybridization, and reactive oxygen species. The use of SWNTs as nIR optical sensors has potential utility in clinical or medical settings because nanotube PL occurs in a region of the electromagnetic spectrum in which blood and tissue is particularly transparent. Additionally, SWNTs do not photobleach and are ideally suited for long-term sensing applications. Hydrogels are cross-linked polymer matrices that can swell in the presence of water and are attractive materials for biological applications due to their biocompatibility and structural properties. They have been proposed as scaffolds for tissue engineering and have been fabricated to respond, by expanding or contracting, to specific stimuli for a number of drug delivery and sensing applications. Hydrogels have previously been fabricated with single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes embedded; however, there exists no demonstration of SWNT PL inside a hydrogel matrix. The current invention proposes a hydrogel-based sensor utilizing SWNTs that can be advantageous for in vivo applications due to the inherent biocompatibility of the hydrogel matrix, and if the matrix is non-biodegradable, it would also prevent nanotube leaching.\n\nProblem Addressed: Other biological sensors are not transparent through blood and tissues and are more susceptible to photobleaching. This device allows for inserting stable photoluminescent SWNTs into hydrogels which can then be embedded into biological tissues for stable long term in vivo sensing.\n\nAdvantages: Long-term sensing. In vivo sensing applications. Biocompatibility. Avoids SWNT leeching into the body if the hydrogel matrix is non-biodegradable."
MIT,Phononic Shield Against AcousticThreats,Case number: #14823K,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/phononic-shield-against-acoustic-threats,"This invention has applications in the development of wearable passive hearing protection devices that filter out hazardous noise while allowing communicative sounds such as speech and audible alarms to be heard. These hearing protection devices can be used in the military as well as a wide range of civilian industries such as manufacturing and construction.\n\nTechnology: This invention describes a passive acoustic filter made up of a periodic array of shaped unit cells. These unit cells collectively make up a phononic crystal whose internal topology allows sound waves of some frequencies to propagate through with less attenuation than others. The performance of this phononic filter is primarily dependent on its geometric design rather than material properties. This affords significant design freedom in selecting materials and manufacturing processes for affordable production at large scale. The phononic filter may be fabricated in a highly scalable single-material “mold-and-release” process. The design described in this invention is capable of reducing system size by approximately three times compared to existing phononic filters. This compactness allows the phononic filters to be incorporated into easily wearable HPDs.\n\nProblem Addressed: Hearing loss is a major cause of disability among military personnel who are routinely exposed to a wide range of acoustic threats ranging from machinery noise to ordnance detonation. Currently, utilization of hearing protection devices (HPDs) in the field is limited. Passive HPDs such as earplugs indiscriminately attenuate sounds over a wide frequency band, leading to reduced situational awareness. This limitation contributes to low utilization rates of currently issued passive HPDs. Active HPDs rely on digital processing circuitry to selectively attenuate hazardous noise. However, their fragility and prohibitively high cost has thus far prevented widespread use. This invention addresses these limitations with a new class of passive frequency-selective hearing protection devices.\n\nAdvantages: Effective attenuation over a wide range of frequencies (normalized gap size of 117%) while allowing propagation of sounds necessary for communication.. Reduces form factor by approximately 3 times compared to existing phononic filters.. Acoustic performance decoupled from material characteristics.. Significantly lower cost and higher robustness compared to active hearing protection devices (HPDs)."

MIT,Carbon Nanotube Growth on BasaltFiber,Case number: #14121,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/carbon-nanotube-growth-basalt-fiber,"This technology has applications in industries that require high temperature-resistant fibers for fabrication of refractory textiles or reinforcement of structural materials where it can improve the strength of basalt fibers.\n\nTechnology: The CNT growth process described by the Inventors is compatible with basalt fibers in the form of filament, thread, or fabric. After undergoing a cleaning process to remove potential surface contaminants, the basalt fiber substrate is optionally treated with a catalyst. Subsequently, it is inserted into a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) furnace where it is heated to temperatures in excess of 300 ℃ under a reducing atmosphere. At this point, a hydrocarbon is introduced into the furnace, where it supplies carbon atoms for CNT growth on the fiber surfaces. This process results in a mixture of CNTs, carbon nanofibers (CNFs), and vertically aligned CNTs (VACNTs) on the surface of the fibers. The relative proportions of these nanostructures can be tuned by manipulating the growth conditions.\n\nProblem Addressed: Glass fiber is widely used as a reinforcement material to improve the strength and stiffness of structures. However, glass fiber’s utility is limited in applications where resistance to high temperatures and high loads is required. Basalt fibers with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) deposited on their surface is a promising alternative to glass fiber in high-temperature, high-strength applications. Existing methods of depositing CNTs are poorly compatible with basalt fibers due to substrate degradation during the deposition process or the need for an additional catalyst deposition step before CNTs can be grown. This invention addresses these problems with a method of growing CNTs on basalt fibers in which the use of growth catalyst is optional.\n\nAdvantages: Optional use of catalyst reduces cost and process complexity. CNT growth process does not degrade mechanical properties of substrate fiber, leading to a net overall improvement in mechanical performance of the augmented fiber"

The upper waveguide and lower waveguide regions are used for guiding the laser mode while the active region is arranged so etching into the VLM SCOWL is permitted to define the ridge waveguide structures, leaving the active region unetched. One or more mode control barrier layers are positioned adjacent to the active region. These mode control barrier layers are used to control the profile of the fundamental mode and prevent mode collapse of the laser mode.\n\nProblem Addressed: Scaling the spatial mode size to increase the output power of slab-coupled optical waveguide laser (SCOWL) is extremely difficult and can lead to mode collapse of the fundamental mode.\n\nAdvantages: Improved peak power. Increased and scalable output power. Implementable in different material systems (already implemented in the InGaAs/AlGaAs/GaAs material system)"

The actively addressable aperture is moved over the entire aperture plane and an image is taken at each position. This yields a 2D grid of 2D photos that can be assembled into a 4D parameterized light field. The many different-perspective images can be used to calculate the 3D depth of the object being imaged, resulting in a 3D model with 2D surface irradiance patterns, which is the full 5D, non-parameterized light field.\n\nProblem Addressed: The full, five-dimensional (5D) light field can be obtained from the 4D parameterized light field. The major challenge is that current devices for constructing 4D light field from 2D images are either bulky or low resolution.

MIT,Self-Assembled (Poly-(L-Glutamic Acid-PEG-Drug)-PLGA Micelles for Multistage Nanoparticle DeliverySystem,Case number: #14877J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/self-assembled-poly-l-glutamic-acid-peg-drug-plga,"Nanoparticles for a selective, two stage delivery to tumors have been developed. The nanoparticles are initially sized so that they preferentially accumulate in the tumor tissue as a result of leakage through the defective vascular in the solid tumors. Once in the tumor tissue, the nanoparticles are cleaved hydrolytically and/or by enzymatic cleavage over time to release smaller nanoparticles carrying therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic agents into the necrotic interior of the tumors. This provides a simple, elegant and highly effective means of delivery drug selectively not just to tumors generally, but, more importantly, into the poorly vascularized necrotic interiors which drugs are normally unable to penetrate. The nanoparticles have a number of advantages: less toxicity due to selective accumulation only in the tumors; access into the poorly vascularized necrotic interiors of the tumor; and sustained release over a period of time within the tumor."

MIT,Oxygen-Functionalized Carbons for Rechargeable LithiumBatteries,Case number: #15063,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/oxygen-functionalized-carbons-rechargeable-lithium,"Functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) can be used as electrodes in lithium batteries.\n\nTechnology: Sub-millimeter long few-walled carbon nanotubes (FWNTs) minimize the number of junctions, which can enhance electrical conductivity and the mechanical strength in self-standing networks. In the case of multi-walled carbon nanotube-graphene electrodes, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) can allow successful utilization of the high surface areas of graphene by serving as a “pillar” inserted between graphene sheets that helps reduce the extent of agglomeration, creating a novel ordered, hierarchical structure with electrochemically accessible surfaces. Oxygen functional groups of carbons have Faradaic reactions with lithium ions in lithium cells, therefore, the energy density of carbon electrodes can be controlled by the oxidation time. Functionalized MWNTs that include pseudo-capacitive functional groups are assembled using the layer-by-layer (LBL) technique. These additive-free LBL-MWNT electrodes exhibit high gravimetric energy (200 W h kgelectrode -1) delivered at an exceptionally high power of 100 kW kgelectrode-1 in Li/LBL-MWNT cells when normalized to the single-electrode weight, with no loss observed after completing thousands of cycles.\n\nProblem Addressed: Batteries exhibit high energy as a result of faradaic reactions in the bulk of active particles, but are rate-limited. The alternative, electrochemical capacitors, can deliver high power but at the cost of low energy storage, by making use of surface ion adsorption (referred to as double-layer capacitance) and surface redox reactions (referred to as pseudo-capacitance). A promising approach to merging the advantages of these two different technologies is the use of nanostructured carbon electrodes. Nanostructured carbon electrodes use the faradaic reaction of the surface functional groups to store more energy than the double-layer capacitance on conventional capacitor electrodes and also provide high power capability.\n\nAdvantages: Increases gravimetric energy. Increases power delivery. Increases cyclability"

Coils are adjusted to produce the required field for either synchrocyclotrons or isochronous machines. In addition, magnetic field coils are used to magnetically shield the device, similarly eliminating the need for a ferromagnetic return yoke serving as a ferromagnetic shield. Elimination of all magnetic iron in the flux circuit yields a linear relationship between the operating current and the magnetic field intensity in the beam space. In a synchrocyclotrons this permits continuous beam energy variation without the use of an energy degrader, thus eliminating secondary radiation during the in-depth beam scanning.\n\nProblem Addressed: Superconducting cyclotrons are increasingly employed for proton beam radiotherapy treatment. The use of superconductivity in a cyclotron design reduces its mass an order of magnitude over conventional resistive magnet technology, yielding significant reduction in overall cost of the device, the accelerator vault, and its infrastructure, as well as reduced operating costs.  The present approach for making cyclotrons includes the use of magnetic iron poles and iron return yokes. These iron components comprise a large fraction of the weight of a superconducting cyclotron. Furthermore, due to the nonlinearity of the magnetic properties of iron, existing cyclotrons can produce only a single fixed energy beam, which calls for using a degrader for the in-depth beam scanning.\n\nAdvantages: Reduces weight and cost. Reduced stray magnetic field. Reduced secondary radiation. Permits variable beam energy"

Described herein is a throughput versus SINR result and a corresponding technique for jointly choosing a transmission rate and multiuser detection algorithm that allows computationally constrained cognitive DSA nodes high rate operation in spectrum black space.

MIT,Thermal Pulse Energy Harvesting Strategy andDevice,Case number: #16032,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/thermal-pulse-energy-harvesting-strategy-and-device,"This technology is applicable to thermal energy harvesting, waste heat recovery, and improving ZT for thermoelectric devices.\n\nTechnology: This technology takes advantage of transient heat transfer properties to maximize the temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of the engine.  Heat transfer is not instantaneous so heat applied to the hot side of the engine will heat up the hot side before the other side (the cold side) experiences a temperature increase.  Before the heat flux penetrates to the cold side, the temperature difference between the two sides of the engine is maximized.  When a constant heat flux is applied to the engine, the cold side eventually warms up, reducing the temperature difference across the engine and the engine's harvesting effectiveness.  Delivering heat to the engine in pulses maintains the high temperature difference across the engine since the heat flux is cut off before the cold side warms up.  Then, the engine cools down so the next pulse can recreate the high temperature difference.  The heat pulse can either come from a non-steady heat source or be created with a thermal switch.Interrupting the heat flux to prevent the cold side from warming up can improve the heat harvesting efficiency and power.  In certain configurations, pulse heating can simultaneously increase power by 60% and increase efficiency by 15% over that of a constant heat flux at the same temperature.  With other configurations, pulse heating can increase the efficiency by more than 80% at a decreased power level.\n\nProblem Addressed: Thermal harvesting systems often consist of a heat sink and heat engine connected to a heat source.  In steady state operations, the overall temperature gradient provided by the heat source is split over the engine and heat sink so a portion of the temperature gradient is not available to the heat engine.  This technology uses pulses of heat, instead of a constant heat flux, to concentrate the temperature gradient over the heat engine and increase harvesting performance.\n\nAdvantages: Increased heat harvesting efficiencySuitable for remote applications.

MIT,Stationary Magic Angle Spinning Enhanced Solid State SpinSensor,Case number: #20044L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/stationary-magic-angle-spinning-enhanced-solid-state,"Here we present a solid-state spin sensor with enhanced sensitivity. The enhanced sensitivity is achieved by increasing the T2* dephasing time of the color center defects within the solid-state spin sensor. The T2* dephasing time extension is achieved by mitigating dipolar coupling between paramagnetic defects within the solid-state spin sensor. The mitigation of the dipolar coupling is achieved by applying a magic-angle-spinning magnetic field to the color center defects. This field is generated by driving a magnetic field generator (e.g., Helmholtz coils) with phase-shifted sinusoidal waveforms from current source impedance-matched to the magnetic field generator. The waveforms may oscillate (and the field may rotate) at a frequency based on the precession period of the color center defects to reduce color center defect dephasing and further enhance measurement sensitivity."

The amount of target protein is tightly controlled by the addition of a regulatory compound or an endogenous molecule.\n\nTechnology: This invention consists of a system comprising: (1) A repressor protein (RP) that is either produced within a cell or added to a cell-free biological system; (2) A regulatory RNA sequence that when added in single or multiple copy to the 5' or 3' untranslated region (UTR) of a gene encoding the target protein, is capable of forming an RNA structure (aptamer) that binds the RP (1) with high affinity in the context of a cellular environment or a cell-free system; and (3) a regulatory molecule capable of interacting with the RP and altering its interaction with the aptamer (2).\n\nProblem Addressed: Current inducible gene expression systems focus on the regulation of DNA transcription by allowing users to control the interactions between RNA polymerases and their DNA template. Inducible translation systems include ligand-binding partners (riboswitches) that are capable of affecting local mRNA structure in response to a ligand. Alternative systems allow users to control target mRNA or protein stability by the use of small-molecule-responsive auto endonucleases or by the use of degradation enhancer domains, respectively. However, these systems are highly specific in the factors to which they respond, and cannot be infinitely expanded into multiple, orthogonal inducible systems. The present invention comprehends an extensible and modular system which allows users to combine a given repressor protein (RP) aptamer pair with a given gene of interest, an improvement over riboswitches which are highly context-dependent and have only been developed for a limited set of ligands. In addition, this invention is expandable, since a given repressor protein can be fused with a second protein conveying an additional activity, binding specificity, or subcellular localization. This invention could be applied to regulate the activity of RNA aptamer-based therapeutics and/or to develop medical diagnostic devices. Alternatively, it has potential applications in environmental safety monitoring or as biosensor for exogenous or endogenous compounds.\n\nAdvantages: Reproducible and predictable gene expression manipulation for desire amounts of protein target. Expandable system, allows for the combination of a given repressor protein-aptamer pair to any given gene of interest. Additional activity derived from fusing the repressor proteins to a second protein for binding specificity, or subcellular localization control"
MIT,Down Converting Detection of Photons Using Quantum Dots and Focal PlaneArrays,Case number: #14133J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/down-converting-detection-photons-using-quantum-dots,"This procedure is applicable to the production of any thermally evaporable thin-film device including organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays, thin-film transistors, and bulk material, which currently makes use of """"fine metal masking"""" or other crude patterning methods.\n\nTechnology: The substrate is cooled facilitating the collection of the resist material. The resist is patterned optically or by direct heating so that the desired material can be blanket deposited. The substrate is then warmed so that the resist sublimes, removing everything except the desired material. This method eliminates the need for shadow masks, multiple chamber evacuation cycles, and solvents that may degrade or damage some thin-films physically or chemically. A suitable thin-film material can be chosen for the temperature constraints and the resist heating method utilized. The method conveniently allows for different kinds of multiple layers to be deposited in the same fashion with ease.\n\nProblem Addressed: Traditional semiconductor fabrication technologies rely on photoresists that can be selectively removed by solvent rinses or washing. However, photoresists cannot be used with organic semiconductors as the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of the substrate and photoresist materials are essentially indistguishable. Consequently, organic displays, solid state lighting, and photovoltaics all rely on crude patterning by shadow masking. The growth of these potentially revolutionary technologies is presently limited by manufacturing difficulties such as mask cleanliness, flexibility, and fragility for small feature sizes. This invention introduces a novel class of inert photoresists suitable for lift-off patterning of organic semiconductors on sub -µm length scales.\n\nAdvantages: Eliminates shadow masks, chamber evacuation cycles, and solvents. Convenient multi-layer deposition"
MIT,Dendrimer and Peptide Based Excipients for the Attenuation of ProteinAggregation,Case number: #14184,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/dendrimer-and-peptide-based-excipients-attenuation,"This technology is a protein-stabilizing compound that has applications in protein therapeutic manufacturing and commercial protein/enzyme synthesis.\n\nTechnology: This technology universally stabilizes proteins to prevent aggregation using polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers with a guanidinium surface. The PAMAM dendrimers are an order of magnitude more efficient at preventing protein aggregation than other commonly used excipients such as sucrose and arginine hydrochloride. Aggregation rate is one of the primary determinants of the shelf life of protein therapeutics, and the use of PAMAM dendrimers extends the shelf-life proteins formulations to nearly 5 months at room temperature compared to under 2 weeks for traditional excipients. In addition to use as an excipient, PAMAM dendrimers can be used to prevent aggregation in the high temperature reaction conditions needed to make recombinant proteins, thereby increasing yield and preventing aggregates from clogging machinery.\n\nProblem Addressed: Protein-based therapeutics are one of the fastest growing pharmaceutical sectors, and recombinant proteins are widely used in fields including biotechnology research, agriculture, and food production. A major challenge in manufacturing recombinant proteins is preventing formation of aggregates. Protein aggregates are non-functional and can even be toxic in vivo, therefore it is imperative that the aggregate formation is minimized, and residual aggregates removed. Optimizing production and storage conditions to prevent aggregation is currently time consuming, costly, and requires trial and error testing due to the diversity of protein structures, therefore, there is a need to develop a universal anti-aggregation solution.\n\nAdvantages: Universal anti-aggregation additive for recombinant protein synthesis and storage. Decreases aggregation rate by an order of magnitude compared to standard excipients. Reduces costs associated with developing protein synthesis conditions. Increases shelf life of recombinant proteins. Improves protein yield by reducing aggregation during manufacturing. Simple removal if desired"
MIT,Process and Method for Two-Photon Calcium ImageAnalysis,Case number: #14199JP,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/process-and-method-two-photon-calcium-image-analysis,"This technology is a method of denoising neural activity imaging that has applications in neurobiology research.\n\nTechnology: This technology is a method of computationally reducing noise in live imaging of neuronal circuits in the brain. Neurons fire in a repeated, periodic fashion in response to stimuli, therefore when the firing of an individual neuron is traced over time the resulting graph forms a wave function. These inventors use a cyclic descent algorithm to converge on the harmonic regression that best describes the fluorescence intensity over time of each pixel. The resulting data ignores background noise that is not part of the stimulus-response cycle. Next, the regression generated by the algorithm at each pixel can be used to reconstruct a denoised image. The resulting images have improved subcellular resolution with greatly enhanced contrast and clarity. The algorithms used in this technology allow curve fitting to a complex shape and periodicity, which models cellular response better than the more constrained curve fitting techniques classically used in neurobiology. Additionally, the low computational complexity of the algorithms used in this technology facilitate real-time computation and high throughput processing.\n\nProblem Addressed: The brain is composed of thousands of neurons that form complex, interconnected circuitry. Due to this immense complexity, many of the mechanisms of brain function remain undiscovered. Recent developments in microscopy and fluorescent calcium responsive imaging agents now facilitate subcellular scale real-time imaging of brain neuronal circuits. However, the data generated by these imaging techniques is noisy and computationally complex to process. These inventors have developed new denoising algorithms that can be used for high throughput data analysis of live neuron imaging.\n\nAdvantages: Denoising method for neural activity imaging. Enhances contrast and clarity. Subcellular resolution of neural activity. Computationally simple. High throughput"

Through a low-cost retrofit design, the sensor enables any circuit breaker to monitor multiple loads with high precision.\n\nTechnology: The invention is a new sensor for non-intrusive power monitoring that measures current flow in a circuit breaker without modifying the breaker panel or the circuit breaker itself. The sensor consists of three main parts: an inductive pickup for sensing current from the breaker face, an inductive link designed to transmit power through the steel breaker panel door, and a passive balanced Junction Gate Field-Effect Transistor (JFET) modulator circuit for transmitting information through the inductive link. A Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring system (NILM) interfaces with the sensor and measures the frequency content of transient events in the current signals from a centralized site. This retrofit system allows the power distribution system to non-intrusively and cost-effectively monitor multiple loads from a single location, all with the use of the presented device.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current wrap-around magnetic field sensors are impractical to use as retrofit solutions to existing power monitoring systems and are further constrained by specific safety regulations related to electrical devices. The technology presented is an alternative to the wrap-around magnetic field sensor. It measures the current in the utility feed by sensing the resulting magnetic field at the face of the main circuit breaker. As a result, the device not only adapts to any load monitoring system, but also complies with safety regulations for circuit breakers.\n\nAdvantages: High-precision and centralized load monitoring. Low-cost retrofit design for existing power monitoring systems. Complies with safety regulations"
MIT,Method for Summarizing TextualMaterial,Case number: #17433,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/method-summarizing-textual-material,"Summarization of an input story can be accomplished through identification of causal relationships, both explicit and implicit. The input story is transformed into an interpretation sequence, using syntactic cues, and common sense knowledge of an average reader. The interpretation sequence is a time ordered semantic representation of the input story, comprised of story elements.

MIT,Tissue Specific Delivery of InterferingRNA,Case number: #13947H,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/tissue-specific-delivery-interfering-rna,"This technology provides a means for targeted delivery of siRNA to tumors.\n\nTechnology: Sangeeta Bhatia and colleagues have developed a method that addresses this problem, with a modular delivery system that allows for predictive targeting of siRNA to tissues of interest in a highly specific manner. Their approach involves the non-covalent attachment of a homing peptide, which binds to a specific cell surface receptor, and protein transduction domain, which facilitates cellular entry, to the siRNA. Unlike many other previously described tissue-specific delivery approaches, components in this method can be rationally designed in a predictive manner, and therefore be easily adapted to many cell types. Furthermore, the components are non-cytotoxic and do not provoke an immune response from the host.\n\nProblem Addressed: Recently, siRNA has shown tremendous promise in treating cancer by suppressing certain genes in tumors. However, delivery is extremely challenging, because siRNA must penetrate the tumor cell to be effective and must be delivered in a targeted fashion to prevent deleterious side-effects.\n\nAdvantages: Modular—can easily be modified to target any tissue of interest. Enables rational design of future nanomaterials for siRNA delivery. Noncytotoxic—doesn’t need to be manufactured as a biologic. Potent, selective inhibition of targets. Nonstimulatory—no immune response• Can be modified to deliver other oligomers"

These particles can include core-shell particles, two-compartment 'Janus' particles, and multi-sectioned 'beach ball' particles.\n\nProblem Addressed: Bottom-up approaches for forming particles are limited by particle coalescence and agglomeration during particle growth.

MIT,High Efficiency IncandescentLighting,Case number: #15367K,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/high-efficiency-incandescent-lighting,"This invention relates to a novel way of redesigning the incandescent light bulb using thermal emitter surfaces and multilayer optical filters to increase the operating efficiency.\n\nTechnology: The present technology consists of a thermal emitter coupled to a photonic filter designed to reflect infrared radiation, while offering near 100% transmission in the visible spectrum. It relies on a specific emitter-filter geometry that allows for efficient reabsorption of infrared light, significantly increasing the efficiency relative to standard incandescent bulbs.\n\nProblem Addressed: Incandescent light bulbs are the most common source of everyday lighting. However, during the modern era, these light bulbs were not very efficient as only 2-5% of electrical power ended up in the visible spectrum. The remaining energy was wasted, mostly by radiation in the infra-red spectrum and some as heat loss. Given that 25% of generated electrical energy is used for lighting, more opportunities are sought out to save more power by moving to more energy efficient light sources.\n\nAdvantages: Dramatically better performance relative to current incandescent lighting systems: up to 7 times more efficient.. Compared to standard incandescent lightbulbs, the redesigned bulb achieves the same operating temperature for a fraction of the wall-plug power (as little as 20%)."

Two terminals are used to drive a current through an electrically conductive wire. The conductive wire is partially covered by an electronically insulating layer which simultaneously acts as a good ionic conductor. The insulating layer is then covered with a gate electrode layer which provides the third terminal of the device. With a voltage applied to the gate electrode, ionic species in the insulating layer can then be pumped to or away from the conductive wire, resulting in modifications of the interface and even of the bulk composition of the conductive wire. The conductive wire and insulator material are chosen such that these modifications in the interface and bulk chemistry result in significant modifications in the resistance of the wire. So in this device, it is not the resistance change in the oxide, but rather the resistance change in the conducting wire that gives rise to memristive switching.\n\nProblem Addressed: A conventional memristive switching device consists of two electrodes which are separated by a thin insulating layer. Usually, this device geometry is realized in a vertical stack of bottom electrode layer, insulating layer, and top electrode layer. Application of a voltage or current across the insulating layer then typically results in the formation of a conductive filament through the insulating layer. However, conductive filament formation is a statistical process which is hard to control, difficult to predict, and usually occurs under conditions close to dielectric breakdown of the insulating layer. The proposed device is a three-terminal device that does not rely on conductive filament formation for its memristive properties.\n\nAdvantages: Predictable memristive properties.. Flexible device structure."

MIT,RNA Degradation-based ToggleSwitch,Case number: #21622,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/rna-degradation-based-toggle-switch,"Regulated transgene expression is an integral component of gene therapies, cell therapies and biomanufacturing. However, transcription factor-based regulation, upon which most applications are based, suffers from complications such as epigenetic silencing that limit expression longevity and reliability. Constitutive transgene transcription paired with post-transcriptional gene regulation could combat silencing, but few such RNA- or protein-level platforms exist. Here we develop an RNA-regulation platform we call “PERSIST"" which consists of nine CRISPR-specific endoRNases as RNA-level activators and repressors as well as modular OFF- and ON-switch regulatory motifs. We show that PERSIST-regulated transgenes exhibit strong OFF and ON responses, resist silencing for at least two months, and can be readily layered to construct cascades, logic functions, switches and other sophisticated circuit topologies. The orthogonal, modular and composable nature of this platform as well as the ease in constructing robust and predictable gene circuits promises myriad applications in gene and cell therapies."
MIT,RNA-Triggered Protein Cleavage and Applications by the CRISPR Cas7-11-Csx29Complex,Case number: #24545J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/rna-triggered-protein-cleavage-and-applications,"The type III-E CRISPR–Cas7-11 effector binds a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and the putative protease Csx29 and catalyzes crRNA-guided RNA cleavage. We report cryo–electron microscopy structures of the Cas7-11–crRNA–Csx29 complex with and without target RNA (tgRNA), and demonstrate that tgRNA binding induces conformational changes in Csx29. Biochemical experiments revealed tgRNA-dependent cleavage of the accessory protein Csx30 by Csx29. Reconstitution of the system in bacteria showed that Csx30 cleavage yields toxic protein fragments that cause growth arrest, which is regulated by Csx31. Csx30 binds Csx31 and the associated sigma factor RpoE (RNA polymerase, extracytoplasmic E), suggesting that Csx30-mediated RpoE inhibition modulates the cellular response to infection. We engineered the Cas7-11–Csx29–Csx30 system for programmable RNA sensing in mammalian cells. Overall, the Cas7-11–Csx29 effector is an RNA-dependent nuclease-protease."

MIT,"Persistent-Mode MRI Magnet Fabricated from Reacted, Monofilamentary MgB2Wires",Case number: #16305,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/persistent-mode-mri-magnet-fabricated-reacted,"This invention has applications in magnetic resonance imaging for medical diagnostics, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging for biomedical research, as well as other areas where superconducting magnets are used.\n\nTechnology: A superconductive joint can be formed between two ends of reacted MgB2 wire by shearing the ends at acute angles and inserting them into the cavity of a stainless steel billet which is filled with a powdered mixture of magnesium and boron. A copper plug is then pressed into the cavity, partially sealing the billet. Finally, the billet is completely sealed using a ceramic paste and heat treated. In tests conducted on both short lengths of wires and test coils, magnets fabricated using this technique have been shown to be capable of quench-free operation at fields up to 90% of their critical currents, despite evidence of multiple flux jumping events. Additionally, they were shown to be capable of carrying persistent currents of up to 100 A while subjected to self-fields up to 0.94 T. This suggests that monofilament MgB2 wire is a viable material option for the fabrication of persistent-mode superconducting magnets.\n\nProblem Addressed: Most existing MRI machines have low-temperature superconducting magnets made from multifilament niobium-titanium (NbTi) wires operating at 4K. These magnets require cooling with liquid helium, which is quickly becoming a scarce and expensive commodity. Reacted magnesium diboride (MgB2) is an attractive alternative material which is capable of operation at higher temperatures, and which enables the use of larger-diameter monofilament wires. However, the lack of a reliable method of making superconductive joints between MgB2 wires in their reacted form is an obstacle to wider adoption of MgB2 as a magnet winding material. Existing manufacturing techniques require coils to be wound from unreacted wire, and entire magnets to undergo heat treatment to react the wires, driving up production costs and increasing scrap rates due to imperfect joints that cannot be repaired.This invention demonstrates a novel method to form superconducting joints between reacted MgB2 wires.\n\nAdvantages: Technique for joining reacted wires allow react-and-wind manufacturing workflow. Reduces reliance on liquid helium. Resistant to quenching despite occurrence of flux jumping"
MIT,Enhanced Evaporative Heat Transfer Device Using PorousMembranes,Case number: #16063K,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/enhanced-evaporative-heat-transfer-device-using,"Applications for this technology are found in thermal management for high performance defense systems and electronic devices.\n\nTechnology: This thermal management approach takes advantage of a supported nanoporous membrane with self-regulated microfluidic networks capable of dissipating >1kW/cm2 on a 1cm2 area with a 200x200µm2 hot spot dissipating 5kW/cm2. Previous developments in thermal ground planes have utilized micro/nanostructured wicks but are fundamentally limited by the coupling between the capillary pressure generated by the wick and the liquid transport through the wick. The proposed design decouples these through the device’s architecture and allows the flexibility to scale down the nanopore size to achieve large driving pressure without increasing the viscous losses. The membrane provides the required capillary pressure that allows for high heat transport, while a hierarchy of characteristic flow length scales transports liquid and minimizes the pressure drop. Also, the vapor escape above the membrane is separate from the liquid flow path such that flow instabilities are avoided with 100% vapor exit quality. The proposed coolant is pentane because of its favorable thermophysical properties and its non-polar and non-toxic nature. The supporting ridge structures are fabricated in silicon carbide (SiC) and the microfluidic network is fabricated in silicon (Si). This allows the Coefficient of Performance (CoP) – thermal power dissipated over power input – to be> 100. Finally, because the heat is dissipated primarily via evaporation, the overall heat transfer coefficient is 0.18 kW/cm2K and an order of magnitude higher than state-of-the-art. These improvements create the desired dissipated heat flux of 5kW/cm2 and seek to maintain a backside chip temperature of ~75-80°C.\n\nProblem Addressed: Currently, advancements in high performance defense electronics are bottle-necked by thermal management. This technology improves thermal management through an intrachip two-phase evaporative cooling solution.\n\nAdvantages: Capable of dissipating >1kW/cm2. Requires little power input because membrane is self-regulating. Overall heat transfer coefficient is an order of magnitude higher than state-of-the-art"
MIT,Toroidal Bending Magnets for Hadron TherapyGantries,Case number: #17367,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/toroidal-bending-magnets-hadron-therapy-gantries,"Toroidal bending magnets which are suspended in gantries in proton and carbon beam therapies.\n\nTechnology: Multiple plates resting against a bucking cylinder are used in the toroidal bending magnet. There are gaps between the plates, and one of them is used for beam bending. The rest of the plates contribute to the field in the gap used for bending, and to reduce the stray magnetic field. The additional magnet plates are not otherwise used directly, and no beam passes through the gaps between them. Adjusting the spacing of the plates creates changes in the magnetic field that can be used to adjust the path of the hadron beam. Additionally, the Bragg peak can be scanned in all three dimensions: ordinate and coordinate (within the treatment plane at fixed beam energy) and in depth (varying the location of the treatment plane within the body) with the inclusion of achromatic magnets. Achromatic magnets have two conventional dipoles separated by one or more quadrupole (focusing) magnets and allow variation in the beam energy. The quadrupole magnets compensate for dispersion and shift in beam direction because of the variation in beam energy. Achromatic magnets can be made by combining two toroidal bending magnets. The simple geometry may also allow the use of higher fields, making it attractive for carbon therapy, as well as proton therapy.\n\nProblem Addressed: Several designs exist for proton and carbon beam therapy; however, because of stray field, either a large amount of external ferromagnetic shielding is required (such as iron), or a second set of coils with a reversed field are needed to reduce or eliminate the magnetic fields from the dipole. In either case, the weight of the magnets is high, and means to reduce the weight and size of the system are desired. The advantage of the toroidal magnet is that there is no need for magnetic shielding, thereby substantially decreasing the weight of the system.\n\nAdvantages: Decreases weight.. Decreases stray field.. Allows higher fields."
MIT,"Graphene Foams, Process to Manufacture Them, and Materials ProducedThereby",Case number: #14776K,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/graphene-foams-process-manufacture-them-and-materials,"Reduced graphene oxide foams are used in the manufacture of composites and porous materials with desirable mechanical, electrical, and barrier properties. This invention describes a novel method to produce reduced graphene oxide foams by reducing exfoliated graphene oxide in aqueous dispersions.\n\nTechnology: This invention describes a method of manufacturing reduced graphene oxide foams from aqueous graphene oxide dispersions, which are usually produced by exfoliating graphene sheets from graphite through an oxidative process. A water miscible diamine is added to the aqueous graphene oxide dispersion and the mixture is agitated. This results in the separation of a foamed phase which floats on top of the water. This foam—comprising reduced graphene oxide, the diamine added, and air cells—is easily separated from the water by skimming or gravitational separation, removing the need for a costly filtration step. The diamine used as the reducing agent also acts as a carrier and curing agent in epoxy-based composite formulations, allowing the separated foam to be used directly for further composite processing without additional purification.\n\nProblem Addressed: Existing methods to reduce exfoliated graphene oxide utilize hazardous chemicals (e.g., hydrazine, organic solvents, etc.) that are often incompatible with subsequent steps in the composite manufacturing process. Additionally, many existing methods also include filtration steps to separate the reduced graphene oxide from the liquid phase. These filtration processes are challenging to scale up because the excellent barrier properties of graphene lead to rapid plugging of filters. This invention addresses these shortcomings with a graphene reduction process utilizing a reducing agent that doubles as a curing agent for epoxy composite formulations.\n\nAdvantages: Does not utilize hazardous chemicals (e.g., hydrazine).. Produces reduced graphene oxide foam that can be used directly in epoxy-based composites with no additional purification.. Avoids costly and difficult-to-scale graphene filtration processes."
MIT,Nanoengineered Hierarchical Polysulfone Membrane for EmulsionSeparation,Case number: #15286,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/nanoengineered-hierarchical-polysulfone-membrane,"This invention is ideal for separation of two immiscible liquids, like oil and water, for applications such as deep seep oil exploration, oil purification, oil spill cleanup.\n\nTechnology: This invention relates to articles and methods for separations. The hierarchical porous membrane suitable for use in oil/water separation processes is comprised of a polymer and is oleophilic and hydrophobic. It has a first layer with small pores and a second support layer that is substantially thicker than the first layer and has substantially larger pores than the first layer. The method of preparing this hierarchical porous membrane consists of combining a polymer, a pore former and a solvent to make a polymer solution, casting the polymer solution on a plate, following step, immersing the plate in a non-solvent to allow release of air bubbles and optionally, cutting the layer of the membrane  resulting from  the following step to undergo coagulation, thereby forming the hierarchical porous membrane.\n\nProblem Addressed: Separation of oil and water mixtures is of great importance across a wide range of technologies and industries. Existing separation devices and methods are either environmentally unfriendly, extremely energy intensive, or incapable of performing the desired separations. For example, in deep soil oil extraction, when most of the water is separated using current methods, trace amounts of water still remain. These trace amounts of water in oil may cause problems for end users, process equipment, and machinery. Current separation techniques are therefore inefficient and incapable of performing the wide range of oil and water separations of interest. There is a need for more efficient devices and methods for separating oil and water mixtures. In particular, a need exists for separating trace amounts of water from oil and water mixtures.\n\nAdvantages: Separate trace amounts of water. Easily alter properties of the membrane and control parameters critical to operation"
MIT,Anti-Fingerprint Photocatalytic Nanostructure for TransparentSurfaces,Case number: #16220,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/anti-fingerprint-photocatalytic-nanostructure,"This technology can be used to produce flexible glass/polymer-based surfaces for a wide range of commercial products including: touch screens, touch pads, electronic displays, glasses, goggles, windows, windshields, optical device lenses, photovoltaic cells and light bulbs (including LEDs).\n\nTechnology: The inventors have developed a method that exploits the photocatalytic oxidation of titanium dioxide nanoparticles as a way to chemically degrade deposited fingerprint oils. This technology consists of a nanotextured surface comprised of multilayers of titanium dioxide and silicon dioxide nanoparticles deposited on transparent substrate. The outermost layer of the coating is composed of pure TiO2nanoparticples, maximizing both photocatalytic oxidation, to remove oils, as well as the optical transmission of the transparent coated surfaces. The thin layers between the outermost layer and the substrate can be composed of SiO2, TiO2, glass, polymer, metal, etc. to provide additional functionalities such as anti-reflectivity, anti-fogging or anti-scratch properties.A layer-by-layer assembly technique is used to enable uniform coating thickness of each layer to ensure good optical property. Oppositely-charged polymeric and nanoparticle solutions are used to ensure a conformal coating that reduces light scattering and haze. This coating method enables extremely precise control of film thickness and uniformity even on curved surfaces, compared to other typical coating methods such as dip-coating, spray-coating and solvent casting.\n\nProblem Addressed: The micrometric pattern of fingerprint films usually scatters light and results in blurry images behind optically transparent and distortion free smooth surfaces such as windows, glasses, touch screens and electronic displays. Fingerprint-resistant coatings can be applied to avoid unwanted oily fingerprint films on these transparent surfaces.\n\nAdvantages: Coating method provides anti-fingerprint, anti-reflection, anti-fogging, anti-scratch and anti-bacterial propertiesTiO­2 coating maximizes photocatalytic effect and optical transmission to achieve rapid removal of fingerprint film. Coating method can be applied to large area curved substrates with uniform thickness. Coating has high mechanical durability to reduce cracks and defects on flexible substrates"
MIT,Mechano-Hydrothermal Alteration of Potassium-Bearing Rock-FormingMinerals,Case number: #16228,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/mechano-hydrothermal-alteration-potassium-bearing,"This technology allows for the extraction of potassium from rock-forming minerals. The process results in an inert aluminosilicate matrix that could be used as an additive to concrete.\n\nTechnology: Sylvinite is the traditional natural source of potassium. However, rock-forming minerals such as potassium feldspars (KALSi­3O8) are earth-abundant and contain up to 16 wt% of K2O. This technique targets these rock-forming minerals. The process is two-step. The preliminary step is a course grinding of the mineral potassium aluminosilicate source down to approximately 5mm. After crushing, the first step is high intensity milling of the ground mineral and calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2, with CaO:SiO2 = 0.1-0.3 and water:solid = 2:1-10:1. This high intensity milling must occur for at least an hour, but can be continued for as long as desired. The second step is the hydrothermal reaction. The mixture is placed in a pressure vessel at the appropriate temperature (150-300oC ) and corresponding water vapor pressure, while being stirred. The time in the pressure vessel depends on the ultimate temperature, pressure, and stirring conditions, but should be at least 3 hours. After the hydrothermal reaction, the final product can release potassium into ultra-pure water, acidic or basic aqueous solutions, and aqueous solutions containing cations. Using ultra-pure deionized water, more than 12% of the potassium contained in the mineral source can be extracted within 8 hours. The rate of potassium release can be changed by varying the surface specific area and the microstructure, which are controlled primarily by the stirring mode during the hydrothermal reaction and secondarily by the milling technique.\n\nProblem Addressed: Currently, potassium is dominatly obtained from the mineral Sylvinite in specific regions of the world. The potassium is then shipped to agricultural regions and is very expensive. This technology allows for localization of potassium fertilizer manufacturing, through a technique that requires less economic risk and no solid waste.\n\nAdvantages: Does not require strong acids or bases. Performed at moderate temperatures ( ≤300 oC). Avoids the formation of solid waste"
MIT,Grid Interface Power ConversionArchitecture,Case number: #16232,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/grid-interface-power-conversion-architecture,"Connecting electronic devices to the AC distribution system is a well understood task, and significant work has been completed in both sourcing power from, and delivering power to the grid. Applications of this technology include AC-DC conversion and LED lighting in commercial and residential applications.\n\nTechnology: This technology improves power conversion by modifying the circuit architecture and allowing for a means to achieve sufficient power factor. The circuit architecture is characterized by a line-frequency rectifier, stack of capacitors, a set of regulating converters, and a power-combining converter. The rectifier connects the grid voltage to the capacitor stack while the capacitor stack allows for a high power factor in the power converter. The converters provide the total energy transfer needed by modulating the current drawn from the capacitor stacks and transferring the current to the line-frequency rectifier. The regulating converters regulate the outputs to allow for very high frequency operation with high efficiency and low device voltage stress, and the power-combining converter draws energy from the regulating converter outputs and delivers the combined power to the converter system output.\n\nProblem Addressed: The common method to achieve a high power factor is to cascade a power factor correction rectifier and a DC-DC converter. A boost converter is typically used in this process because it has a high power factor capability of about 0.99. However, with a boost converter, high voltage stress is applied to the components in the circuit, consequently reducing the overall efficiency. The buck converter, an alternative to the boost converter, has less voltage stress but the active components must still be operated directly from the AC line voltage, and hence require high voltages. This high voltage requirement results in low efficiency and low power density. A high power factor is desired to reduce transmission losses and improve the overall voltage regulation at the load. Moreover, a high power factor improves the stability and efficiency of the transmission network. By using a power conversion circuit that is capable of regulating and combining converter topologies, this technology decreases the voltage stress of the active and passive devices within the converter. This configuration allows for reliable power converters with  high-frequency operation capabilities that are able to achieve a high power factor.\n\nAdvantages: Increases device lifetime. Increases overall efficiency. Allows for substantial minimization"

MIT,Hyper Resolution Multi-FrameImaging,Case number: #14572,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/hyper-resolution-multi-frame-imaging,"Hyper resolution multi-frame imaging can be used to significantly improve image resolution of a physical object. There is an increasing desire for high-resolution images needed for surveillance and facial recognition in various military and law enforcement applications.\n\nTechnology: The invention is a method to process a “hyper resolution” image of a physical object by using cameras of multiple resolutions (spatial, temporal, or spectral). The sequence of images of the physical object is obtained at a plurality of relative displacements with respect to the object by a hybrid camera system comprising at least two imaging systems. A software program will be used for deriving the super-resolution image. Image sequences derived by each imaging system are co-registered and then reconfigured through a computer algorithm to solve for the resultant sequence of images characterized by a spatial resolution exceeding the first and the second camera imaging resolution.\n\nProblem Addressed: Although existing image registration methods work well for many imaging-based applications, the current resolution level in these methods does not meet the anticipated increase in demand for higher resolution images. Spatial resolution of a physical object in the infrared spectrum is low when using a single imaging system. Therefore, this technology uses multiple resolutions to find an effective way to improve low-resolution (LR) images.\n\nAdvantages: Improvement in resolution by one or two orders of magnitude..

MIT,Tissue Stiffness Quantification for Diagnosis andMapping,Case number: #17896,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/tissue-stiffness-quantification-diagnosis-and-mapping,"This technology automatically diagnoses skin cancer through tissue characterization. This invention has applications for dermatologists, non-specialists like physicians and nurse practitioners, and patients who are able to perform self-measurement.\n\nTechnology: This invention relies on measuring skin stiffness, an intrinsic property that changes when tissue becomes cancerous. Stiffness measurements provide a quantifiable metric and a way to determine subcutaneous topology, and can be combined with standard automated image analysis of the lesion to diagnose and track the evolution of the lesion over time. This device automates the visual analysis and manual palpation that occurs when a patient visits the dermatologist, producing greater sensitivity and consistency while turning traditionally subjective tests into objective measurements. Using algorithms and digital imaging devices, this invention can measure tissue characteristics associated with cancerous lesions, such as asymmetry, border irregularity, color, diameter, elasticity, and vasculature. To simulate manual palpation and estimate the stiffness of the lesion, an illuminated grid is superimposed on the skin and a constant force is applied to create a full-field normalized compliance map that can be used to quantify the stiffness of a cancerous lesion and the healthy tissue surrounding it. A difference in tissue stiffness indicates a higher probability that the lesion is cancerous. Once the tissue characteristics and stiffness are quantified, the data can be used with a machine learning algorithm to give a quantified score related to the probability that the lesion is cancerous. Furthermore, the same lesion can be monitored over time, as frequently as necessary, to evaluate the evolution of a lesion. If the lesion is considered to be cancerous, a normalized compliance map can be used to determine the boundary of the lesion, providing a means to determine the extent of the lesion for excision. Boundaries can be projected on the lesion, or the border can be directly printed or tattooed onto the tissue to provide the surgeon with a path to properly remove the lesion. This technology increases accuracy over traditional methods by removing complexity and subjectivity, thereby improving survival rates, reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies, and reducing overall costs to the healthcare system.\n\nAdvantages: Maps the stiffness and morphology of a suspect lesion, otherwise traditionally observed through visual observation and palpation.. Provides a method to continually monitor the skin and provide alerts when changes are observed.. Improves skin cancer survival rates.. Enables real-time, in-situ identification of surgical margins."
MIT,Deformation-Based Loop Closure for Large Scale Dense RGB-DSlam,Case number: #16271J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/deformation-based-loop-closure-large-scale-dense-rgb,"The inventors present a system for capturing large scale dense maps in an online setting with a low cost RGB-D sensor. This has significant applications in robotics, where a robot’s ability to create a map of an unknown environment and know its position within that map is crucial for intelligent autonomous operation.\n\nTechnology: The Inventors’ SLAM system is comprised of two main components, the frontend (for camera tracking and surface extraction) and the backend (for pose graph and map optimization). The frontend used is the Kintinuous mapping system, based on the KinectFusion™,  system. This real-time dense mapping system integrates all depth measurements into a volumetric data structure and carries out camera pose estimation is then carried out via a dense Iterative Closest Point (ICP) function. As the volumetric structure moves, the region of the surface that leaves the volume is extracted in point cloud form. The stream of “cloud slices” along a camera trajectory each have an associated camera pose. The final component in the frontend is a visual place recognition module that detects visual loop closures and computes appropriate relative camera pose constraints.The backend performs incremental pose graph optimization coupled with incremental non-rigid dense map optimization. A dense every-frame pose graph is optimized according to the loop closure constraints. The optimized dense camera trajectory is used to conjunction with matched visual features to constrain a non-rigid space deformation of the map. The inventors use an embedded deformation approach to apply it to large scale dense maps captured with the Kintinuous frontend and derive efficient incremental methods to prepare the map for deformation. By combining pose graph optimization with non-rigid deformation of a dense map, they obtain highly accurate dense maps over large scale trajectories that are both locally and globally consistent.\n\nProblem Addressed: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) in 3D space is a key research area in modern robotics. Notable RGB-D 3D reconstruction systems include KinectFusion™, which enables dense volumetric modeling of a static scene in real-time at sub-centimeter resolution. Current solutions to adapt this technology over extended areas suffer from problems of unbounded drift due to an open-loop process. The Inventors present a method to address loop closures in a volume shifting-based mapping systems that take advantage of camera pose graph optimization and non-rigid space deformation. The result is a visual SLAM system that captures high fidelity dense maps in real-time with the local reconstruction quality of KinectFusion™,  and the advantages of local consistency given by camera pose graph optimization.\n\nAdvantages: Low-cost and easy-to-implement system based on existing RGB-D technology and frameworks.. Incremental method for deformation graph constructions allows multi-million point maps to be captured over hundreds of meters in real-time..

MIT,Robocap,Case number: #24836J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/robocap,"This technology relates to cases #23759 and #25153.\nThis tech brief lists two distinct devices. The first is an ingestible vibrating pill, or a Vibrating Ingestible BioElectronic Stimulator (VIBES), which is designed to stimulate vagal nerve signaling to promote satiation, decreased food intake, decreased weight gain, and increased weight loss in the long term. The second is an ingestible robotic drug delivery device which is intended to improve bioavailability of drugs. Both technologies may be of relevance in development of drug delivery systems, treatment of GI neural diseases, and obesity.\n\nTechnology: VIBES:. The technology is in the form of an orally ingestible pill containing a motor and battery, as well as a gelatinous membrane that dissolves 3-5 minutes after immersing in the gastric fluid. The dissolving of this membrane allows a spring-loaded pogo pin to be released, completing an onboard circuit and activating vibration at 80 Hz for roughly 30 minutes. This vibration creates an illusory sensation of stomach filling and distension, stimulating intra-ganglionic laminar endings (IGLEs). These IGLEs are vagal afferents that activate the nucleus of the solitary tract, which is involved in the brain’s hunger circuitry. By triggering the sending of the “satiated” signal to the brain, VIBES alters metabolic hormone production such that the person feels full. This result of these alterations is reduced feeding behavior, as evidenced by the fact that pigs treated with VIBES consumed roughly 50% less of their meal compared to controls.\n\nProblem Addressed: VIBES:. Now affecting over 40% of American adults, the obesity epidemic is an increasingly burdensome stressor on the healthcare system. With obesity comes increased risk of diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and heart disease, all of which require the use of healthcare resources. Current weight loss options have their challenges: Behavioral modifications require dramatic life-style changes; bariatric surgery is costly, invasive, and can have complications; pharmacologic therapies have proven inadequate; and intragastric balloons (IGBs) are ineffective in the long-term and pose safety concerns. VIBES aims to provide a method for weight loss that is safer and more effective than these existing options through a vibrating pill that triggers an early sensation of satiety. It has already been successfully tested in pigs and works to reduce food intake.\n\nAdvantages: Promotes weight loss in a non-invasive, convenient, safe way. Safely passes out of system following vibration for a set time. Can lower blood sugar through weight loss, helping treat diabetes"

MIT,Boron-ContainingPharmacophore,Case number: #21111,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/boron-containing-pharmacophore,"This technology is a collection of chemical compounds containing borolone moieties for use in chemical biology, medicinal biology, and materials chemistry.\n\nTechnology: The inventors have developed metabolically stable, borolone-containing compounds with applications in chemical biology, medicinal chemistry, and therapeutics development. The inventors characterized the oxidative stability of phenylboronic acid and two derivatives, benzoxaborole and benzoxaborolone. Benzoxaborolone is 2x10<sup>4</sup>-fold more stable towards oxidation by hydrogen peroxide than phenylboronic acid and benzoxaborole. Furthermore, the inventors demonstrate that benzoxaborolone can successfully inhibit activity of several enzymes, including ribonuclease A, pig liver esterase, and calf intestinal phosphatase. Overall, these findings demonstrate that usage of benzoxaborolone and other borolone-containing compounds as pharmacophores can greatly expand the potential for developing metabolically stable and effective, boron-containing drugs.\n\nProblem Addressed: Boronic acid compounds are extensively used in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry as versatile intermediates during the synthesis of drugs and other complex molecules. However, the use of boronic acids, themselves, as pharmaceutical agents has been very limited despite their favorable properties, including low inherent toxicity and the ability to bind covalently and reversibly to proteins and carbohydrates. To date, there are only four drugs containing boron, including the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. One reason for the sparsity of boronic acids in the clinic is the poor metabolic stability of boronic acids, particularly susceptibility to oxidation in aqueous contexts. Therefore, there is a need to develop metabolically stable boron-containing compounds to expand the use of boronic acids as pharmacophores.\n\nAdvantages: Borolone-containing compounds exhibit superior metabolic stability over the more commonly used boronic acids, phenylboronic acid and benzoxaborole. Expands the potential for development of effective, boron-containing therapeutics"

MIT,Continuous Operation of Monolithic Organic Lasers with No DyeCirculation,Case number: #15962,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/continuous-operation-monolithic-organic-lasers-no-dye,"Organic lasers are inherently tunable for a variety of sub-wavelength structured organic-based light emitting and sensing devices. Much like organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), these lasers are cheaper and produce a much purer light than their inorganic counterparts.\n\nTechnology: The proposed CW organic lasers comprise of a resonant cavity, an organic dye medium electromagnetically coupled to the cavity, and an optical pump source that stimulates emission of a continuous-wave beam. Suitable organic dye media are of the cynanine and merocynanine class, comprising liquids and solids at varying concentrations. These dye concentrations generate continuous wave output beams that can be tuned to a specific amplitude or wavelength region for lasing. In addition, the organic gain medium includes one or more quenchers that improves CW lasing by limiting or reducing absorption of the pump beam.\n\nProblem Addressed: Organic dye lasers have attractive features, such as low-cost processing, flexible choice of substrates, and emission cross-sections. While optically pumped organic lasers are feasible, lasing is only possible with high peak power excitation sources of short pulses. As a result, there has been no realization of continuous wave (CW) operated organic lasers without liquid dye circulation. Conventional dye lasers have high, hard to attain thresholds due to large losses at the electrical contacts and low charge carrier mobility in organic materials.\n\nAdvantages: Enhanced wavelength-specific CW lasing via the cynanine/merocynanine dye class and quenchers. Lower operating temperature enabled through a reduced pump beam intensity. Stationary organic dye medium and pump beam removes the need for moving parts"
MIT,Corona Discharge Assisted Oil in Water and Water in OilSeparator,Case number: #16015,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/corona-discharge-assisted-oil-water-and-water-oil,"This technology relates to the use of corona discharge to assist in the separation of oil and water in emulsions.\n\nTechnology: The present technology uses electrodes in order to establish corona discharge, a sharp electrode (emitter) and a blunt grounded electrode (collector). A gaseous medium is also needed, which can be air or other gases either below, at, or above atmospheric pressure. The blunt grounded electrode is placed in the emulsion, while the sharp end is in contact with the gaseous medium. When a potential difference between a sharp and blunt electrode is applied, above the corona discharge threshold, the imposed electrical field becomes strong enough around the sharp tip, resulting in partial ionization of the surrounding neutral gaseous molecules. The cloud of ions are generated and accelerated towards the low potential region.\n\nProblem Addressed: Methods of emulsion separation are very diverse and challenging:Gravity: Although the most common method, in order to separate emulsions, they must be pretreated with chemicals and heated after gravity separation. Physical: These methods can include heating, centrifugation, filteration, ultrafiltration and membranes, and reverse osmosis. However, these do have limitations in capital costs of high-energy consumption for large volumes and degeneration of the membrane coating materials.Electrostatic: Energy consumption is low for the destabilization of the emulsion, however, this method suffers severe limitations.  In conventional electrocoalescencers, both electrodes are immersed in the emulsions. This method will not function properly when the content of water in the emulsion is too high. Additionally, electrostatic discharge may introduce dangers of explosions, corrosion of the electrode or electrode coatings, and increase the contamination due to the chemical decomposition of the oil around the electrodes.\n\nAdvantages: The high voltage electrode has no contact with the emulsion given that the voltage drop occurs between the electrodes, thus significantly reducing the chance of arc or electrostatic breakdown. Corona discharge can inject large volume charge densities in the emulsion so that the strong non-uniformity of the electric field in the non-homogenous emulsion medium may increase the chance of coalescence"

Micro scale square posts are fabricated on silicon wafers with photolithography followed by a reactive ion etch. Silica particles with different diameters, 15-75nm, are spin-coated and sintered on the substrates already having micro scale square posts to create a hierarchical structure. The textured surfaces significantly enhance nucleate boiling and diminish the Leidenfrost limits, which increases heat transfer and reduces dryout.\n\nProblem Addressed: Heat exchangers use boiling to transfer heat away from a solid. However, boiling is limited by the critical heat flux (CHF), which occurs at the Leidenfrost point, where a vapor is generated between the droplet and solid surface. The vapor causes heat transfer via conduction, which leads to dry-out and slows down heat transfer. A superwetting surface reduces the effects of the Leidenfrost effect by preventing vapor formation and continuously rewetting the surface; therefore, improving overall heat transfer.\n\nAdvantages: Increases critical heat flux.

MIT,Synthetic Hydrogels for Stem Cell Propagation andOrganogenesis,Case number: #20047,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/synthetic-hydrogels-stem-cell-propagation-and,"*Technology #20047 is available for non-exclusive licensing.\nThis technology is a tunable, synthetic hydrogel for culturing human or mammalian cells and forming organoids (3D structures with specific cell types and micro architecture similar to the tissue of origin), which can be used as both a research tool and for testing drug efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity with patient-derived cells. One has precise control over mechanical and biological cues in this hydrogel, which is not feasible with hydrogels derived from nature.\n\nTechnology: This invention is a synthetic hydrogel consisting of branched biodegradable polymers and one or more binders. The polymers are preferably multi-arm polyethylene glycol (PEG) macromers of various molecular weights while the binders include adhesion ligands, for example, integrin binding peptides derived from collagen, fibronectin, and/or laminin or extracellular matrix components (ECM) binders which are synthetic peptides with affinity for ECM components. The biodegradable polymers are crosslinked via synthetic peptides containing protease-, proteinase-, or transpeptidase- cleavable motifs so they can be dissolved on demand to yield intact organoids substantially free of hydrogel polymers. The method of forming the synthetic hydrogel involves a first step in which the PEG macromers and various peptide binders are functionalized. For example, PEG macromers may receive vinyl sulfone groups; the peptide binders or crosslinking agents may be synthesized with a free thiol group at the N-terminus. The hydrogels can also include cells, tissues, organs or combinations of these. Described in this invention is adjustment of the hydrogel’s biomechanical properties for support of organoids derived from human epithelial, endometrial or gastrointestinal cells.\n\nProblem Addressed: Organoids are 3D cellular structures with organ-specific cell types and microarchitecture similar to the tissue of origin. They are grown typically by embedding stem cells in Matrigel™, then waiting for the stem cells to self-organize and undergo morphogenesis. However, Matrigel™ lot-to-lot variability and its complex composition prevents researchers from fully investigating the role of the matrix in stem cell organogenesis. The lot variability also contributes to unpredictability in drug discovery experiments. Lastly, extraction of the organoids for downstream analysis (e.g. transcriptomics) is difficult. This novel hydrogel enables control of the mechanical and biological properties, allowing researchers to investigate the role of cell-matrix interactions in organogenesis and provide greater consistency between batches for drug discovery. The inert polymer backbone of the synthetic matrix allows proteomic and transcriptomic analysis without removal of the organoid from the hydrogel.\n\nAdvantages: Inexpensive and broadly accessible methods. The hydrogel integrates easily into commercially available tools and methods. High cell viability comparable to other gel types. Broad support of intestinal cells from various regions of the intestinal track with the possibility of incorporating other cell types (intestinal myofibroblast, immune cells). Supports human and mouse stem cells. Mechanically robust and easy to tailor"

In each trial, X-ray photons are emitted along the path until a Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode “clicks”. A temporal average—i.e., the average amount of time elapsed before a “click” occurs—is calculated. This temporal average is, in turn, used to estimate a causal intensity of X-ray light that passes through the tissue along the path and reaches the diode. Based on the causal intensities for multiple paths, a computer generates computed tomography (CT) images or 2D digital radiographic images. The causal intensities used to create the images are estimated from temporal statistics, and not from conventional measurements of intensity at a pixel. X-ray dosage needed for imaging is dramatically reduced as follows: a “click” of the photodiode triggers negative feedback that causes the system to halt irradiation of the tissue along a path, until the next trial begins."

MIT,Phonon-Recycling Light-EmittingDiode,Case number: #15786,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/phonon-recycling-light-emitting-diode,"Contrary to conventional wisdom, which holds that light-emitting diodes (LEDs) should be cooled to increase efficiency, the LEDs disclosed herein are heated to increase efficiency. Heating an LED operating at low forward bias voltage can be accomplished by injecting phonons generated by non-radiative recombination back into the LED's semiconductor lattice. This raises the temperature of the LED's active rejection, resulting in thermally assisted injection of holes and carriers into the LED's active region. This phonon recycling or thermo-electric pumping process can be promoted by heating the LED with an external source (e.g., exhaust gases or waste heat from other electrical components). It can also be achieved via internal heat generation, e.g., by thermally insulating the LED's diode structure to prevent (rather than promote) heat dissipation. In other words, trapping heat generated by the LED within the LED increases LED efficiency under certain bias conditions."

MIT,Enhanced Differentiation to Endodermal Derivatives with Modulated OxygenLevel,Case number: #15589,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/enhanced-differentiation-endodermal-derivatives,"Applications for this technology are found in cell replacement therapy and treatment of type I diabetes.\n\nTechnology: This invention presents a novel method for differentiating human embryonic stem (hES) cells into β-cells for the treatment of type I diabetes.  The inventors established that modulation of the O2 level to which cells are exposed has a pronounced effect on the outcome of directed differentiation protocols; hence, culture O2 concentration is important for almost every aspect of PSC differentiation. Accurate control of pO2 at hypoxic levels dramatically changes timing and magnitude of differentiation markers and enhances differentiation to mesodermal and endodermal but not ectodermal lineages.  Moreover, low O2 for extended periods after differentiation is complete drastically reduces the number of residual PSC within the differentiated cell population and thus reduces their tumorigenic potential. The method presented in this invention allows accurate control of cellular O2 exposure, making it possible to achieve substantial increases in insulin-producing β-cell yields.  O2 control, alone or combined with other methods, can be applied to future cell therapy protocols to generate and increase the safety of differentiated cells.\n\nProblem Addressed: Pluripotent stem cells (PCS) hold promise for cell replacement therapy and for studying embryonic development.  However, efficient differentiation of PSC to desired cell types remains a challenge, and potential tumor formation by residual PSC in differentiated populations is problematic.  Prior PSC research has mainly focused on growth factors, signaling molecules, or extracellular matrix (ECM) components to promote targeted differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells, and the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) experienced by ES cells has been largely overlooked.  Most PSC research is performed in high, non-physiological O2, but during embryonic development, cells are exposed to much lower pO2 values.  Effects of low pO2, though poorly understood, are likely to be very important in determining the direction of differentiation pathways.\n\nAdvantages: Allows accurate control of cellular O2 exposure. Substantially increases the generation of insulin-producing β-cell cells in sufficient purity and quantity for use in humans"

The novel solar thermal fuel is composed of azobenzene-functionalized carbon nanotubes and can have both volumetric and gravimetric energy densities comparable to that of Li-ion batteries.\n\nProblem Addressed: Large-scale adoption of solar thermal fuels requires enhanced energy storage capacity and thermal stability.

Easily transportable in liquid or powder form. Easy to recharge. Can cycle through energy conversion and release numerous times without degradation.

MIT,"A Method and System to Enable Multiple Independent Wireless Transmitters to Transmit Simultaneously to their Clients, Thereby Allowing Wireless Throughput to Scale Linearly with the Number ofTrans...",Case number: #14965,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/method-and-system-enable-multiple-independent,"MegaMIMO is the first working system that can scale wireless LAN throughput linearly with the number of transmitters and can be applied to achieve fully scalable wireless networks.\n\nTechnology: The core component of MegaMIMo is a lightweight distributed phase alignment algorithm that allows N single-antenna access points (APs) to behave as if they were a single giant MIMO AP with N packets concurrently to N clients. The algorithm works as follows: one of the APs acts as the lead, and all other APs adjust their transmitted signals to emulate a scenario where they share the same oscillator as the lead AP. Every joint transmission (i.e. a transmission of concurrent streams) starts by the lead AP transmitting a short synchronization header. The other APs listen to the synchronization header, and use it to discover the difference between their own oscillator phase and the oscillator phase of the lead AP. They can then align the phase of their own transmission with the lead AP by multiplying by the appropriate angle.  This synchronization cannot persist over time because different APs have different frequency offsets, which causes their signals to rotate at different speeds over time. To address this issue, the APs also use the synchronization header to estimate the frequency offset, predict changes in phase caused by this offset, and compensate for them during phase synchronization. MegaMIMO inserts resynchronization symbols periodically in a packet to allow APs to track the phase difference with the lead AP. Since the frequency of resynchronization symbols only depends on measurement error, and does not change with the increased number of APs, the overhead of such symbols is a small constant that becomes negligible as the number of APs increases.\n\nProblem Addressed: Wireless networks today are limited by interference that occurs when two nearby devices transmit simultaneously, preventing either device from delivering its packet. Recent wireless systems like SAM, IAC and beamforming allow concurrent transmissions across different transmitters in the same interference region and have advanced the state of the art in practical wireless design, allowing wireless networks to double or triple their throughput. Nonetheless, these systems remain limited by the maximum number of antennas on an individual node, and cannot continuously scale the throughput as more transmitters join the systems. The Inventors have developed MegaMIMO, a practical system that overcomes this barrier and enables wireless throughput to increase linearly with the number of transmitters to enable fully scalable wireless networks.\n\nAdvantages: MegaMIMO can deliver a median throughput gain of 9.4x in a 10 AP network"
MIT,Fiber DrawSynthesis,Case number: #14718K,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/fiber-draw-synthesis,"The applications of this invention are in fiber devices used in telecommunication, optical imaging, industrial monitoring, remote sensing and functional fabrics.\n\nTechnology: This invention enables the synthesis of a high-melting temperature semiconductor in a low-temperature fiber drawing process. During this process, reagents in the solid state are arranged in proximate domains within a fiber preform. The preform is liquidized at elevated temperatures and drawn into fiber, reducing the lateral dimensions and bringing the domains into intimate contact to enable chemical reaction. The synthesized compound semiconductor becomes the basis for an electronic hetero-structure diode of arbitrary length in the fiber. The ability to synthesize materials within fibers while precisely controlling their geometry and electrical connectivity at sub-micron scales presents new opportunities for increasing the complexity and functionality of fiber structures.\n\nProblem Addressed: Traditional fiber-optic drawing involves a geometric scaling where the fiber materials and their relative position are both identical to those found in the fiber preform. To date, all thermally drawn fibers are limited to the preform composition and geometry. Therefore, there is a need for better fiber drawing methods with the ability to synthesize new compounds during the process.\n\nAdvantages: This process substantially expands the set of materials that can be incorporated into fibers.

MIT,Impedance Control ResonantConverter,Case number: #14449,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/impedance-control-resonant-converter,"High power density, high efficiency, and the ability to maintain these efficiencies across wide operating ranges of output power and input/output voltage are key objectives in the design of power electronic converters. This invention taps into applications for dc devices, such as solar photovoltaic systems, battery systems, LEDs, and electronic loads. This technology has an effective means of connecting all of these components together through the use of increasingly efficient power electronic converters.\n\nTechnology: This invention proposes a new resonant power converter architecture that operates at a fixed frequency, yet achieves simultaneous zero voltage switching (ZVS) and near zero current switching (ZCS) of the transistors across a wide operating range. An impedance control resonant power converter operated at a fixed switching frequency includes an impedance control network (ICN) coupled between two or more inverters operated at a fixed duty ratio with a phase shift between them and one or more rectifiers. The proposed approach uses inverter stacking techniques to reduce the voltages of individual devices. The inverters are coupled to the converter input and the rectifier(s) is coupled to the converter output. The phase shift is used to control output power or compensate for variations in input or output voltage. Implementation of fixed duty ratio of individual switches allows the increase of switching frequency (hence reducing size and mass) while achieving very high efficiency, and/or to scale designs at conventional frequencies for extreme high-efficiency operation. This technique also enables effect resonant gating. The combination of ZVS/near-ZCS with resonant gating changes the loss tradeoffs encountered in conventional soft switching designs, and enables design scaling into new areas providing better combinations of size and loss.\n\nProblem Addressed: To achieve high efficiencies at high power densities, power converters must operate at a  high switching frequency, using soft-switching techniques such as zero voltage switching (ZVS) and zero current switching (ZCS) (where the switch voltage and current are zero at the switching transition). However, soft-switching only provides high efficiency operations under specific operating conditions, and performance tends to degrade greatly when considering requirements of operation across varying input voltage, output voltage, and power levels. This challenge in maintaining high efficiency is tied to both the circuit design and the control methodology. One common way of controlling resonant soft-switched inverters (e.g., series, parallel, series parallel converters, etc.) is frequency control, in which the output voltage is regulated in the face of load and voltage variations by modulating the converter switching frequency. Because of the inductive loading requirements to achieve ZVS switching, power is reduced in such converters by increasing the switching frequency, thereby exacerbating switching loss. Another method of control that can be applied to bridge converters at fixed frequency is phase-shift control. In this method, multiple inverter legs are phase-shifted from each other to counteract variations in input voltage and maintain output power. Unfortunately, as the inverters are phase shifted from each other, it is possible for asymmetric current waveforms to arise. This can increase conduction loss as well as a loss of ZVS. A third technique for enabling soft-switching is through the use of an auxiliary circuit that can divert current or voltage from the main power switches in order to shape the waveforms necessary for ZCS or ZVS. These circuits inherently add component and control complexity, and may not always lead to an increase in efficiency across the full operating range. There is an evident need for converter designs and associated controls that can provide reduced loss when operating over wide voltage and power ranges. This invention especially focuses on operation over wide input voltage and power ranges.\n\nAdvantages: Enhances achievable performance for wide input voltage and power range operation. ICN combines power from the inverters such that as the phase angle among inverters is adjusted, low-loss switching of the inverter circuits is maintained. ICR converter can also be designed as an inverter (dc/ac converter) for synthesizing an ac output component at frequencies far below the switching frequency"
MIT,A Usable Interface for Location-Based Access Control and Over-the-AirKeying,Case number: #14407L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/usable-interface-location-based-access-control-and,"This technology facilitates the dissemination of data among mobile devices with cryptographic protections. It has applications in the aviation, auto, trucking and taxicab industries, as well as satellite and mobile communications. Specifically, one application of this technology is for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to broadcast video surveillance data to selectively chosen mobile receivers on the ground for commercial, civilian and military use.\n\nTechnology: The inventors have developed a map-based graphical user interface that allows an operator to specify access control rules for broadcasting content to subscribers in mobile settings by defining geographic regions on the map and associating individual receivers with these regions, among other conditions. The interface allows the operator to define and save different access control rules for different types of missions, and to automatically enforce a particular set of rules during the mission. Once such access rules are defined using the intuitive user interface described above, they are enforced via cryptographic means. A recently developed technology called Dynamic Group Keying (DGK) allows one to change the data encryption key at any time and to securely and efficiently distribute the new key to authorized receivers. The distribution of keys to the receivers is accomplished using an Over-TheAir Keying (OTAK) protocol. Only authorized receivers possess the correct key, meaning no other receivers can decrypt the data feed. The monitoring and rekeying may occur in parallel with the broadcast, and the rekeying can be made completely transparent to the subscribers unless the subscriber's access status has changed.\n\nProblem Addressed: Modern cryptography offers numerous schemes for the protection of various types of data, at-rest and in-transit, across a broad set of applications. Some major impediments to the adoption and use of cryptographic protections in applications is the lack of easy-to-use interface and resource-laden key management that could allow users to enact desired protections through intuitive means. Furthermore, it is desirable for operators to employ cryptographic protections to control the conditions (such as location) under which receivers can access communication data.\n\nAdvantages: Simple and intuitive user interface. Technology allows for specified access rules in mobile settings based on the publishers' and subscribers' identities, locations, time, and other conditions"
MIT,Angular Photonic BandGap,Case number: #14368,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/angular-photonic-band-gap,"Angular photonic band gaps transmit or absorb electromagnetic radiation based on the polarization and reflecting electromagnetic radiation of certain frequencies. Applications for this effect are found in solar energy, as this technology enables a nearly perfect greenhouse effect. Also, this invention will be useful for structures designed to ""trap"" light of a known incidence angle.\n\nTechnology: This invention presents a novel class of material systems that strongly discriminate light based on the angle of incidence, over a broad range of frequencies, and irrespective of the polarization. The meta-material system proposed consists of a one-dimensional periodic photonic crystal whose constituents possess anisotropic properties. This photonic material comprising of a plurality of photonic crystals can be used to selectively transmit and/or selectively absorb one portion of incoming electromagnetic radiation while reflecting another portion of incoming electromagnetic radiation. The design structure opens an angular gap for both polarizations over a certain frequency range with the possibility of enlarging the frequency range to the specific angular discrimination desired.\n\nProblem Addressed: An issue with current technology is the low efficiency of the solar-energy conversion, which is limited by re-radiation of sunlight, consequently causing energy loss. This invention demonstrates how light close to normal incidence can be near perfectly transmitted, independent of polarization. Moreover, this invention uses photonic crystals whose constituents have an anisotropic dielectric and/or magnetic response to enable such transmission.\n\nAdvantages: Reduces energy loss.

MIT,New Technologies to Improve High Frequency Performance in NitrideSemiconductor,Case number: #14353,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/new-technologies-improve-high-frequency-performance,"High electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) are used for power management in high frequency products ranging from cell phones to radar equipment.\n\nTechnology: To mitigate the gm-collapse, the interface between the gate metal and the AlGaN surface needs to be passivated. Additionally, to maximize frequency performance the vertical and lateral dimensions of the gate have to be harmoniously scaled. To passivate the gate metal- AlGaN interface an ohmic contact metallurgy based on alloyed Si/Ge/Ti/Al/Ni/Au (2/2/20/100/25/50 nm)  was used and observed to reduce ohmic contact resistance by 55% and surface roughness of the contacts by 83% over conventional non-recessed Ti/Al/Ni/Au ohmic contacts. To scale the vertical and lateral dimensions of the gate, vertical gate-recess, oxygen plasma treatment, and then lateral gate-etch were used. First e-beam lithography is used to create the gate length. Then 10 nm of ALD-Al­2O3 sidewalls protects the gate length defined by e-beam lithography from the oxygen plasma treatment. After Ni-Au gate metal deposition, the bottom Ni layer is selectively etched to further reduce the gate length.\n\nProblem Addressed: Their high breakdown field and electron velocity make HEMTs ideal devices for power amplification at high frequencies. However, in spite of recent progress in maximum operating frequency, the performance and electron velocity of these devices are still well below the theoretical predictions. The work on this device showed for the first time that the lower-than-expected frequency performance of HEMTs is mainly caused by a significant drop of the intrinsic small-signal transconductance (gm) with respect to the intrinsic DC gm. The proposed device combines vertical gate-recess, oxygen plasma treatment, and lateral gate-etch to fabricate AlGaN/GaN HEMTs with a record current-gain cutoff frequency (fT) of 162 GHz for a gate length (Lg) of 110 nm, and 225GHz for an Lg of 55 nm.\n\nAdvantages: Increases current-gain cutoff frequency.

MIT,Passive Wide-Area Three-DimensionalImaging,Case number: #20766L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/passive-wide-area-three-dimensional-imaging,"Radar, lidar, and other active 3D imaging techniques require large, heavy sensors that consume lots of power. Passive 3D imaging techniques based on feature matching are computationally expensive and limited by the quality of the feature matching. Fortunately, there is a robust, computationally inexpensive way to generate 3D images from full-motion video acquired from a platform that moves relative to the scene. The full-motion video frames are registered to each other and mapped to the scene coordinates using data about the trajectory of the platform with respect to the scene. The time derivative of the registered frames equals the product of the height map of the scene, the projected angular velocity of the platform, and the spatial gradient of the registered frames. This relationship can be solved in (near) real time to produce the height map of the scene from the full-motion video and the trajectory."

MIT,Multi-spatial Mode Enabled PAT and AO Terminal Architecture for Free-space OpticalCommunications,Case number: #20508L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/multi-spatial-mode-enabled-pat-and-ao-terminal,"Many free-space optical (FSO) communications systems use pointing, acquisition, and tracking (PAT) systems to align the transmit and receive apertures for efficiently coupling received light to a detector. Conventional PAT systems divert energy from the communications receiver to a photodiode array for measuring tilt in the focal plane. Unfortunately, diverting energy from communications to PAT reduces SNR and sensitivity for communications. The PAT terminal disclosed here determines tilt angle without diverting energy from the communications receiver. It tracks the power in different spatial modes and uses that power distribution to determine tilt information for PAT. It does this with a passive mode converter, such as a photonic lantern, that maps power in each spatial mode at the receive aperture to a different single-mode output. Photodetectors at the single-mode outputs convert the received light into electrical signals that are demodulated for communications and whose amplitudes are used to derive the tilt information."

MIT,Physical-Layer Quantum Error Suppression for Superconducting Qubits in Gate Model Quantum ComputationApplications,Case number: #20255L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/physical-layer-quantum-error-suppression,"A device combines physical qubits into a logical qubit according to a passive, quantum error-suppressing code, and weaves logical qubits into a fabric for performing computation or annealing according to an active, quantum error-correcting code. By using enough physical qubits in each logical qubit, the error suppression can overcome errors introduced by ambient noise, such as thermal fluctuations. However, interactions between individual logical qubits are based on interactions between multiple physical qubits, such as XX or ZZ interactions, so logical interactions require intermediary circuitry capable of coupling four or more spins-this circuitry also is described, wherein coupling an ancilla qubit to such intermediary circuitry allows the formation of a logical qubit having passive error suppression, and arbitrary computations can be performed using a fabric of such circuitry. Concatenating the active and passive codes does not increase circuit complexity, or reduce the speed of gate operations."

MIT,Hybrid Integration for Photonic Integrated Circuits(HIPIC),Case number: #20286L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/hybrid-integration-photonic-integrated-circuits-hipic,"Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) enable manipulation of light on a chip for telecommunications and information processing. They can be made with silicon and silicon-compatible materials using complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication techniques developed for making electronics. Unfortunately, most light sources are made with III-V and II-VI materials, which are not compatible with silicon CMOS fabrication techniques. As a result, the light source for a PIC is either off-chip or integrated onto the PIC after CMOS fabrication is over. Hybrid integration can be improved by forming a recess in the PIC to receive a III-V or II-VI photonic chip. Mechanical stops formed in or next to the recess during fabrication align the photonic chip vertically to the PIC. Fiducials on the PIC and the photonic chip enable sub-micron lateral alignment.

This antiviral platform facilitates rapid, targeted SpongeBot development and deployment against SARS-CoV-2, its viral mutations, as well as entirely new viruses - providing a barrier to future viral pandemics. SARS-CoV-2 is highly communicable and individuals can transmit the disease even prior to becoming symptomatic, sharply increasing the rate of disease spread. During the first two weeks following infection, the innate immune system attempts to slow down the rapidly multiplying pathogen to provide time for the adaptive immune system to develop more specific and effective mechanisms to destroy the virus. However, in individuals with decreased or compromised immune responses, the excessive viral load can lead to elevated inflammation, severe tissue damage, and ultimately death. SpongeBot, our bioengineered cell-based therapy solution, provides vital support to the body?s immune system, through its genetically designed ability to sequester and destroy SARS-CoV-2 viral particles at sites of injury, in addition to attenuation of the immune system?s hyperinflammatory response to the virus. Administering SpongeBot cells to an infected individual reduces and keeps viral load below dangerous thresholds, prevents harmful hyperinflammation, and provides the adaptive immune system the time required to mount an effective defense against the virus. SpongeBot can be administered prophylactically to at-risk populations (e.g., healthcare workers, the elderly, or immunocompromised individuals), or therapeutically at any stage during the course of viral infection. Importantly, SpongeBot therapy is extremely safe; the base technology has a long proven clinical safety track record. Unlike the lengthy development times necessary for vaccines or antiviral medications, a targeted SpongeBot therapy against a predicted virus can be placed in clinical trials immediately. SpongeBot development for a novel virus would be ready for deployment in only about 12 weeks."

Instead, in a ferrimagnetic oscillator magnetometer, the applied magnetic field shifts the resonance of entangled electronic spins in a ferrimagnetic crystal. These spins are entangled and can have an ensemble resonance linewidth of approximately 370 kHz to 10 MHz. The resonance shift produces microwave sidebands with amplitudes proportional to the magnetic field strength at frequencies proportional to the magnetic field oscillation frequency. These sidebands can be coherently averaged, digitized, and coherently processed, yielding magnetic field measurements with sensitivities possibly approaching the spin projection limit of 1 attotesla/√{square root over (Hz)}.

The inventors engineered a M13 capsid protein to serve as a template for nanofiber self-assembly. The two-step nanofiber synthesis begins by using M13 phage to nucleate formation of resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) nanofibers. In the second step, the RF nanofibers are carbonized to yield carbon nanofibers with uniform shape and a very small diameter. Importantly, both the nanofiber morphology and surface nanotexture can be tuned by altering the M13 nucleation moiety or the composition of the RF mixture, respectively. The inventors demonstrate that these microporous carbon nanofibers can be used as an interlayer in lithium-sulfur batteries to greatly increase the discharge capacity and retain capacity after repeated cycling. Additionally, these carbon nanofibers show promise as a therapeutic treatment of toxin exposure, and proof of concept experiments demonstrate these nanofibers are superior to activated carbon in adsorbing toxins.\n\nProblem Addressed: Carbon nanofibers are nanometer diameter filaments formed from graphene. Carbon nanofibers have tunable properties that can be adapted for use in lithium batteries, medical therapeutics, or environmental toxin remediation. Current methods to manufacture carbon nanofibers require specialized equipment and frequently result in inconsistent fiber sizes.

MIT,Phosphorylation-Based miRNA HighSensor,Case number: #19683,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/phosphorylation-based-mirna-high-sensor,"This technology is a miRNA guided circuit to sense cellular biomarkers that improves upon current circuit technologies and has applications in cellular therapeutics and research.\n\nTechnology: This technology is a miRNA circuit that uses orthogonal components derived from E.coli to drive expression of a desired output. The inventors engineered E.coli histidine kinases to function either as kinases (K) or as phosphatases (P). These K and P proteins are able to positively or negatively regulate, respectively, a transcription factor (TF) that then drives expression of the desired output. MiRNA target sites specific for the high-miRNA are present on the P transcript, and the low-miRNA target sites are present on the K, TF, and output transcripts. Therefore, for the circuit to function and produce an output the high-miRNA must be present, or P will be expressed and turn off output. Additionally, the low-miRNA must be absent or K, TF, and output expression will be repressed. The inventors demonstrate that this system is robust with low basal activity and the system can achieve six fold activation of circuit output when high-miRNA is on and low-miRNA is off.\n\nProblem Addressed: Sensing cellular biomarkers to drive a desired output allows cells to be used as miniature computational circuits. These cellular circuits can be used to generate outputs such as identifying the cell of interest with a marker, producing a desired secreted protein, or having a therapeutic effect only in cells that meet all of the circuit requirements. For example, sensing cell-type can allow for targeted killing of cancer cells that express particular markers. MicroRNA (miRNA) expression profiles differ widely across cell types, including cancer, and can therefore be used as cell-specific identifiers. Additionally, new multiplexing techniques in which one miRNA needs to be lowly expressed and another highly expressed conveys added specificity to these miRNA circuits. While low-miRNA circuits are straightforward, sensing high-miRNA expression remains a challenge. Current high-miRNA circuits rely on repressive proteins, which can introduce a time lag in the system while the repressor is being produced. Due to this design, there is often period of time in which the output is inappropriately “on” even in the wrong cell type that lacks the high-miRNA. These inventors describe a high-miRNA circuit design that eliminates this time lag by using phosphorylation driven circuitry.\n\nAdvantages: Elimination of lag inherent in current high-miRNA systems by utilizing phosphorylation-driven circuit.

MIT,"A Signal Inverter Module for RNA Cleavers: Detecting and Evaluating miRNA, Ribozymes, andRibonucleases",Case number: #19604,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/signal-inverter-module-rna-cleavers-detecting-and,"This technology is a system to sense high levels of a miRNA using a gain of signal output. This technology has applications in gene therapy using miRNA circuitry and as a research tool for studying miRNA, ribozyme, and ribonuclease activity.\n\nTechnology: This technology is an all-in-one system to sense high levels of a miRNA that eliminates the time lag inherent in most high-miRNA circuitry. To accomplish this, the inventors designed a transcript that has the desired output coding sequence followed by a stabilizer, a miRNA target or ribonuclease cleavage sequence, and finally a degradation signal. Under conditions where the miRNA or ribozyme is not present, the transcript is degraded due to the degradation signal. When the miRNA or ribonuclease is present in the cell, the transcript is cleaved at the miRNA or ribonuclease recognition site, therefore removing the degradation signal from the transcript and allowing expression of the output protein. This tool provides a novel way of designing a miRNA high sensor for miRNA circuits, and it can additionally be used in research applications to test ribozyme and ribonuclease activity.\n\nProblem Addressed: Sensing cellular biomarkers to drive a desired output allows cells to be used as miniature computational circuits. These cellular circuits can be used to generate outputs such as identifying the cell of interest with a marker, producing a desired secreted protein, or having a therapeutic effect only in cells that meet all of the circuit requirements. For example, sensing cell-type can allow for targeted killing of cancer cells that express particular markers. MicroRNA (miRNA) expression profiles differ widely across cell types, including cancer, and can therefore be used as cell-specific identifiers. Additionally, new multiplexing techniques in which one miRNA needs to be lowly expressed and another highly expressed conveys added specificity to these miRNA circuits. While low-miRNA circuits are straightforward, sensing high-miRNA expression remains a challenge. Current high-miRNA circuits rely on repressive proteins, which can introduce a time lag in the system while the repressor is being produced. Due to this design, there is often period of time in which the output is inappropriately “on” for a period of time even in cells without high levels of the miRNA. These inventors describe a high-miRNA sensing circuit design that eliminates this time lag by inverting a traditional miRNA system to yield a gain-of-signal output.\n\nAdvantages: Elimination of lag time inherent in current miRNA high sensors.

MIT,M13 Phage-Functionalized Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes for Molecularly Targeted Imaging of Tumors Using Second Near-InfraredFluorescence,Case number: #14969,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/m13-phage-functionalized-single-walled-carbon,"Specific detection and therapy monitoring of tumors, bacterial infections and hard-to-detect areas\n\nTechnology: In the clinic, non-invasive, real-time and deep tissue imaging greatly facilitates early, accurate diagnoses and surgical procedures. Fluorescence in vivo imaging using second near-infrared (NIR) window light is attractive due to greater penetration of light through tissue. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) show great promise as in vivo imaging agents in the second NIR window, ensuring deeper penetration of light and low autofluorescence. Although SWNTs have previously been used for live cell imaging in vitro and in vivo whole animal imaging, actively targeting in vivo fluorescence imaging has not been achieved, as it is challenging to add targeting moieties to the small coating molecules while keeping the stability of the SWNTs strong enough. Here, multiple capsid proteins of M13 phage were created through independent genetic engineering of M13 phage for in vivo fluorescence imaging of targeted tumors. SWNTs are bound along the length of the phage, while one of the minor coat proteins, p3, of the SWNT-binding phage· is genetically modified to express either peptide ligands or peptide handles for site specific conjugation of antibodies for targeting. By genetically engineering the major coat protein of M13 for stabilizing SWNTs and the minor coat protein for targeting functionality independently, targeting capability was successfully incorporated into the probe without compromising the in vivo stability or the fluorescence of SWNTs.\n\nProblem Addressed: This technology introduces a new method to address the challenge of non-invasive diagnosis and can be used as a tool for clinical procedures requiring immediate feedback, such as intraoperative surgery.\n\nAdvantages: Targeting capability is incorporated into the probe without compromising the in vivo stability of the fluorescence of SWNTs. Due to the interchangeability of its components, potentially, any identified targeting ligands or antibody can be readily exchanged onto the imaging probe for molecular recognition of various cancers and bacterial infections. Targeted fluorescence imaging of tumors is in the longer wavelength window, ensuring greater penetration depth and lower tissue autofluorescence"
MIT,Switched Capacitor Energy BufferArchitecture,Case number: #14953,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/switched-capacitor-energy-buffer-architecture-0,"Energy buffering is necessary in a wide range grid-interface power electronic applications including photovoltaic inverters, motor drives, power supplies, off-line LED drivers and plug-in hybrid electric.\n\nTechnology: The invented stacked switched capacitor (SSC) energy buffer circuits include switches and a plurality of energy storage capacitors. The switches are disposed to selectively couple the capacitors to enable dynamic reconfiguration of both the interconnection among the capacitors and their connection to a buffer port. The switches are cooperatively operated as a switching network such that the voltage seen at the buffer port varies only over a small range as the capacitors charge and discharge over a wide range to buffer energy. The switching network need only operate at a relatively low switching frequency, and can take advantage of soft charging of the energy storage capacitors to reduce loss. Thus, efficiency of the SSC energy buffer circuit can be extremely high compared to the efficiency of other energy buffer circuits. Since circuits utilizing the SSC energy buffer do not need to utilize electrolytic capacitors, they overcome the associated limitations. Without electrolytic capacitors, a high effective energy density can be achieved with a relatively high efficiency across a desired operating range.\n\nProblem Addressed: Energy storage requirements of buffer in power conversion system significantly limit miniaturization of grid interface systems. Since the requirement of the buffer is proportional to the system average power and the line period, the size of the buffer cannot be reduced simply through increased switching frequency. Conventional power conversion systems typically utilize electrolytic capacitors to provide high-density energy storage for buffering. However, these capacitors also represent a significant source of system lifetime and reliability problems. Development of energy buffering circuits that eliminate electrolytic capacitors while maintaining high energy storage density and high efficiency is one important key for future grid interface systems that have both a small size and a high reliability.\n\nAdvantages: Extremely high efficiency since switching network operates at relatively low (line-scale) switching frequency. Reduced loss with soft/adiabatic charging of stacked switched capacitors. Operates at a wide range of voltages with efficiency on the level of electrolytic capacitors without the associate limitations"
MIT,Per Panel Photovoltaic Energy Extraction with Multilevel Output DC-DC Switched CapacitorConverters,Case number: #14725,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/panel-photovoltaic-energy-extraction-multilevel,"Per panel photovoltaic energy extraction has applications in large scale solar energy harvesting.\n\nTechnology: The DC-DC module integrated converters (MICs) typically operate with local autonomous MPPT control. In the system proposed here, the responsibility of MPPT is shared among the DC-DC modules and the central inverter. As a result, the required complexity of the DC-DC MICs is simplified. Significantly, the system can be implemented with switched capacitor multilevel DC-DC converters and a central ripple-port converter. Per panel magnets and electrolytic capacitors are eliminated. The simulated prototype of this configuration achieved the following efficiencies: tracking efficiency 95.43%, conversion efficiency 97.56%, and total efficiency of 93.10%.\n\nProblem Addressed: Total installed cost and total cost of ownership are two key metrics limiting grid penetration of solar power. Both the installed cost and the cost of ownership are affected by the power converter’s lifetime, system complexity, and tracking efficiency. Tracking efficiency is normally addressed with a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm embedded in the control of the converter or inverter. However, in the control of the converter or inverter the MPPT function’s effectiveness is reduced by the power ripple at the panel terminals. This is often overcome by an electrolytic capacitor, but these capacitors have a relatively short lifetime. The proposed technology is a  “ripple port” inverter, which still directly interfaces the PV cell, but directs the 120 Hz ripple power to a transformer couple ripple port and away from the cell. Significantly, the system can be implemented with switched capacitor multilevel DC-DC converters and a central ripple-port inverter.\n\nAdvantages: Improves energy extraction. Reduces system complexity. Reduces cost"

It was discovered that the stability of nanofilms increases with more bilayers since LbL films are held together by ionic interactions between interpenetrated LbL layers. It was also observed that the terminal layer of the LbL nanoparticles plays a vital role in the biodistribution of the LbL particles and affects non-specific uptake. Hyaluronic acid outer layers, provide a long circulation half-life and much lower accumulation in the liver and kidney. This outer layer proves the viability of this system for cancer delivery as the circulation times of LbL nanoparticles were extended to levels sufficient for passive targeting to solid tumors via EPR.\n\nProblem Addressed: Layer-by-Layer (LbL) based nanoparticles are promising new systems for use as drug delivery vehicles as many therapeutics and biologically relevant materials can be easily introduced into LbL films noncovalently and under physiological conditions, without significant alteration of their biological properties. Furthermore, LbL films offer spatial, temporal or active control over the release of therapeutics from the surfaces of macroscopic objects and have great versatility since their composition, surface chemistry and dimensions may be manipulated.  However, LbL based nanoparticles have not been demonstrated for systemic delivery in vivo due to challenges in film stability and biodistribution. This invention has generated systemically deliverable LbL nanoparticles for cancer applications.\n\nAdvantages: Improved film stability allowing for improved biodistribution.

The process provides several advantages over previous processes for chip-to-chip integration, including: (1) shorter processing time as the chips can be diced, bump-bonded, and then thinned at the chip-level faster than in a wafer-level back-illumination process, and (2) the CMOS substrate provides mechanical support for the APD device, allowing integration of fast microlenses directly on the APD back surface.

SBS occurs when the power exceeds a threshold proportional to the beam area divided by the effective fiber length. The fiber lasers disclosed here operate with higher SBS power thresholds (and hence higher maximum powers at kilohertz-class linewidths) than other fiber lasers thanks to several techniques. These techniques include using high-absorption gain fibers, operating the laser with low pump absorption (e.g., ≤80%), reducing the length of un-pumped gain fiber at the fiber output, foregoing a delivery fiber at the output, foregoing a cladding light stripper at the output, using free-space dichroic mirrors to separate signal light from unabsorbed pump light, and using cascaded gain fibers with non-overlapping Stokes shifts.

MIT,"A Compact Device for the Integrated Filtration, Drying and Mechanical Processing of SolidAPIs",Case number: #20601,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/compact-device-integrated-filtration-drying-and,"Recent changes in the pharmaceutical sector call for the development of novel manufacturing approaches to reduce costs and improve control over product quality. In this area, the development of compact, plug-and-play devices that fit in a continuous manufacturing system has gained interest in recent years. Most Nutsche filters offer a versatile solution as compact filtration and drying devices. However, conventional drying processes tend to generate a large amount of lumps, usually requiring further mechanical processing of the isolated drug substance before it can be formulated. In this work, we present a compact, automatable filtration device that takes advantage of a unique impeller design and in situ measurements of the drying heat duty to integrate mechanical processing into the drying step. By preventing the formation of dry lumps during drug substance drying, and breaking needle-like crystals through the developed agitation program, the resulting powder can be directly used for tablet formulation. This device, designed to fit in a compact continuous manufacturing module, has the potential to reduce manufacturing costs and footprint, while allowing for the low-shear mechanical processing of heat-sensitive compounds."

For example, the natural signal may be an electrical signal produced by neural tissue, or a motion such as a muscle tremor. The neuromodulator generates signals that are precisely timed relative to the phase of the natural signal. For example, the neuromodulator may generate an exogenous signal that is phase-locked with the natural signal. Or, for example, the neuromodulator may generate an exogenous signal that comprises short bursts which occur only during a narrow phase range of each period of an oscillating natural signal. The neuromodulator corrects distortions due to Gibbs phenomenon. In some cases, the neuromodulator does so by applying a causal filter to a discrete Fourier transform in the frequency domain, prior to taking an inverse discrete Fourier transform."

MIT,Vibrating Ingestible BioElectronic Stimulator(VIBES),Case number: #23759JQ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/vibrating-ingestible-bioelectronic-stimulator-vibes,"This technology relates to cases #24836 and #25153.\nThis tech brief lists two distinct devices. The first is an ingestible vibrating pill, or a Vibrating Ingestible BioElectronic Stimulator (VIBES), which is designed to stimulate vagal nerve signaling to promote satiation, decreased food intake, decreased weight gain, and increased weight loss in the long term. The second is an ingestible robotic drug delivery device which is intended to improve bioavailability of drugs. Both technologies may be of relevance in development of drug delivery systems, treatment of GI neural diseases, and obesity.\n\nTechnology: VIBES:. The technology is in the form of an orally ingestible pill containing a motor and battery, as well as a gelatinous membrane that dissolves 3-5 minutes after immersing in the gastric fluid. The dissolving of this membrane allows a spring-loaded pogo pin to be released, completing an onboard circuit and activating vibration at 80 Hz for roughly 30 minutes. This vibration creates an illusory sensation of stomach filling and distension, stimulating intra-ganglionic laminar endings (IGLEs). These IGLEs are vagal afferents that activate the nucleus of the solitary tract, which is involved in the brain’s hunger circuitry. By triggering the sending of the “satiated” signal to the brain, VIBES alters metabolic hormone production such that the person feels full. This result of these alterations is reduced feeding behavior, as evidenced by the fact that pigs treated with VIBES consumed roughly 50% less of their meal compared to controls.\n\nProblem Addressed: VIBES:. Now affecting over 40% of American adults, the obesity epidemic is an increasingly burdensome stressor on the healthcare system. With obesity comes increased risk of diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and heart disease, all of which require the use of healthcare resources. Current weight loss options have their challenges: Behavioral modifications require dramatic life-style changes; bariatric surgery is costly, invasive, and can have complications; pharmacologic therapies have proven inadequate; and intragastric balloons (IGBs) are ineffective in the long-term and pose safety concerns. VIBES aims to provide a method for weight loss that is safer and more effective than these existing options through a vibrating pill that triggers an early sensation of satiety. It has already been successfully tested in pigs and works to reduce food intake.\n\nAdvantages: Promotes weight loss in a non-invasive, convenient, safe way. Safely passes out of system following vibration for a set time. Can lower blood sugar through weight loss, helping treat diabetes"
MIT,Method for Using an Optical Filter to Stabilize Optical Fiber Amplifier Operation in the Presence of Stimulated BrillouinScattering,Case number: #21337L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/method-using-optical-filter-stabilize-optical-fiber,"Multi-stage fiber amplifiers can amplify signals from a few Watts to several kilowatts. These amplifiers are limited in power by intensity instabilities resulting from a sequence of nonlinear optical effects. These nonlinear optical effects include stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), with produces a high-intensity pulse close to the signal wavelength that propagates backward up the amplifier chain, causing permanent damage to the upstream components. This SBS pulse can be blocked by an optical isolator that blocks backward-propagating light at or near the signal wavelength. At high enough power levels, the SBS pulse can also induce backward-propagating light at wavelengths tens to hundreds of nanometers away from the signal wavelength. This SBS-Pulse Induced Non-linear Spectrum light is outside the isolator's reject band, so it can propagate upstream and de-stabilize the upstream amplifier stages. It can be suppressed using a filter with a broad reject band and a suppression ratio of ≥30 dB, enabling higher power operation."

MIT,Nonlinear Coupled Magnonics: Terahertz Field-Driven MagnonUpconversion,Case number: #24504J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/nonlinear-coupled-magnonics-terahertz-field-driven,"Tailored light excitation and nonlinear control of lattice vibrations have emerged as powerful strategies to manipulate the properties of quantum materials out of equilibrium. Generalizing the exploitation of coherent phonon-phonon interactions to nonlinear couplings among other types of collective modes would open unprecedented opportunities in the design of novel dynamic functionalities in solids. For example, the collective excitations of magnetic order - magnons - can efficiently transfer information via spin current flow, and their coherent and nonlinear control would provide an attractive route to achieve faster signal processing for next-generation information technologies. Here, we discover that intense terahertz (THz) fields can initiate processes of magnon upconversion via coherent magnon-magnon interactions - a phenomenon that opens the paradigm of nonlinear coupled magnonics. By using a suite of advanced spectroscopic tools, including a newly demonstrated two-dimensional (2D) THz polarimetry technique enabled by single-shot detection, we unveil the unidirectional nature of coupling between distinct magnon modes of a canted antiferromagnet. Calculations of spin dynamics further suggest that this coupling is a universal feature of antiferromagnets with canted magnetic moments. These results demonstrate a route to inducing desirable energy transfer pathways between coherent magnons in solids and pave the way for a new era in the development of magnonic signal processing devices."

The addition of redundancy by an error correction code seeks to combat the damaging effects of corruption. Codes require reconstruction of the original data through decoding. GRAND™ is a novel approach to decoding that improves on existing methods. Traditional decoders are narrowly tailored to exclusively work with specific codes, resulting in a proliferation of decoding hardware. For reasons of decoding complexity, existing codes are generally excessively redundant, making them wasteful and unsuitable for low energy, low latency or high throughput systems such as IoT, 5G, and optical networks. Exceptionally, GRAND™ can efficiently and precisely decode all moderate to low redundancy codes. GRAND™ obviates the need for multiple decoders. It enables backward compatibility with legacy codes and unfettered innovation in introducing new codes. GRAND™ has been shown in silicon to be energy efficient. GRAND™ is applicable in many different industries including AR/VR, low latency gaming, IoT, 5G networks, optical networks, and many others.\n\nTechnology: The GRAND™ method decodes data based on identifying the noise effect, rather than attempting to extract codewords directly from the noise impacted encoded data as existing methods do. The GRAND™ approach contains three main processes that are repeated until a decoding is obtained. Noise effect sequences are sequentially generated in decreasing order of likelihood either a priori based on a statistical channel model or using soft information, such as can be obtained in reception of communication signals. In order, GRAND™ takes a noise effect sequence, inverts its effect from a possibly noise-corrupted signal (e.g., by subtracting or using some other method of operational inversion), and queries whether the resulting data are a valid codeword, using the code merely as a validator or hash. The first instance of code-word identification is the decoding. By mirroring the noisy channel, GRAND™ provides optimally accurate maximum likelihood decoding of arbitrary codes with moderate redundancy that can be chosen to perfectly match system characteristics.\n\nProblem Addressed: Digital data is subjected to errors when stored or transmitted owing to the effects of noise on the medium or communication channel. The solution is to add redundancy to the data on storage or transmission via an error correction code so that, at the time of retrieval of the data, decoding can undo the noise effect and correctly recover the original data.\n\nAdvantages: Decodes any moderate redundancy code, regardless of structure and length, with provably maximal accuracy.

The massive degeneracy and the metallicity of a partially-filled Landau level in the quantum Hall system enable thermoelectric energy conversion with unprecedented efficiency at low temperature.

Under some conditions (e.g., high temperature and/or high pressure conditions), intermolecular interactions between the coating and the one or more foulants may be dominated by the vdW force, and a relatively low vdW force may reduce the likelihood of the one or more foulants adhering to and/or otherwise being deposited on the coating.

In some aspects, a hydrogen-resistant coating comprises a doped tin oxide comprising one or more dopants. The doped tin oxide may, in some cases, exhibit low hydrogen solubility and low hydrogen diffusivity and may therefore reduce and/or prevent permeation of hydrogen in an underlying substrate.

MIT,Social Behavior for AutonomousVehicles,Case number: #21875,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/social-behavior-autonomous-vehicles,"Understanding the intent of human drivers and adapting to their driving styles is used to increased efficiency and safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) by enabling them to behave in safe and predictable ways without requiring explicit inter-vehicle communication. A Social Value Orientation (SVO), which quantifies the degree of an agent's selfishness or altruism, is estimated by the AV for other vehicles to better predict how they will interact and cooperate with others. Interactions between agents are modeled as a best response game wherein each agent negotiates to maximize their own utility. A dynamic game solution uses the Nash equilibrium, yielding an online method of predicting multi-agent interactions given their SVOs. This approach allows autonomous vehicles to observe human drivers, estimate their SVOs, and generate an autonomous control policy in real time."

The non-structural material is solid at room temperature, but is molten during fusion, and is preferably lead. The structural members may be steel or silicon carbide, or similar structural material. During a disruption of fusion, excess electrical energy that escapes from the plasma into the vessel will primarily shear the liquid material rather than the structural members, allowing the ""bread"" to be thin."

MIT,Cryogenic Integrated Circuits Architecture for Multiplexed Chemical-ShiftNMR,Case number: #22378,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/cryogenic-integrated-circuits-architecture,"Chemical-shift nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy involves measuring the effects of chemical bonds in a sample on the resonance frequencies of nuclear spins in the sample. Applying a magnetic field to the sample causes the sample nuclei to emit alternating current magnetic fields that can be detected with color centers, which can act as very sensitive magnetometers. Cryogenically cooling the sample increases the sample's polarization, which in turn enhances the NMR signal strength, making it possible to detect net nuclear spins for very small samples. Flash-heating the sample or subjecting it to a magic-angle-spinning magnetic field (instead of a static magnetic field) eliminates built-in magnetic field inhomogeneities, improving measurement sensitivity without degrading the sample polarization. Tens to hundreds of small, cryogenically cooled sample chambers can be integrated in a semiconductor substrate interlaced with waveguides that contain color centers for optically detected magnetic resonance measurements of the samples' chemical-shift NMR frequencies."

While modern assembly processes can easily integrate thousands of electrical components onto a single board, photonic assembly is far more challenging due to the wavelength-scale alignment tolerances required. Here we address this problem by introducing a self-aligning photonic coupler insensitive to x, y, z displacement and angular misalignment. The self-aligning coupler provides a translationally invariant evanescent interaction between waveguides by intersecting them at an angle, which enables a lateral and angular alignment tolerance fundamentally larger than non-evanescent approaches such as edge coupling. This technology can function as a universal photonic connector interfacing photonic integrated circuits and microchiplets across different platforms. For example, it can be used in a self-aligning photonic circuit board that can be assembled more easily, with larger misalignment tolerances, than other complex optoelectronic systems."

Here, we disclose a robust quantum register composed of hundreds of fermionic atom pairs trapped in an optical lattice. With each fermion pair forming a spin-singlet, the qubit is realized as a set of near-degenerate, symmetry-protected two-particle wavefunctions describing common and relative motion. Degeneracy is lifted by the atomic recoil energy, which depends on mass and lattice wavelength, thereby rendering two-fermion motional qubits insensitive to noise of the confining potential. The quantum coherence can last longer than ten seconds. Universal control is provided by modulating interactions between the atoms. Via state-dependent, coherent conversion of free atom pairs into tightly bound molecules, we tune the speed of motional entanglement over three orders of magnitude, yielding 10* Ramsey oscillations within the coherence time. For site-resolved motional state readout, pairs are coherently split into their constituent fermions via a double-well, creating entangled Bell pairs."
MIT,Green Propellant Conditioning and Injection System for Bi-Modal Chemical-Electric SpacePropulsion,Case number: #22452,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/green-propellant-conditioning-and-injection-system-bi,"Bi-modal propulsion systems and related methods are generally described.

In some embodiments, the reduced pressure of the propellant may be lower than a vapor pressure of at least one volatile component of the propellant, leading to the formation of ""bubbles"" within the propellant line. The presence of alternating gas and liquid phases along a flow path between a propellant tank and the electrical thruster(s) may help to electrically insulate the electrical thruster from the rest of the system."

Such materials may be used in the construction of various process equipment having surfaces exposed to a given fluid that contains a foulant or chemical substance that may deposit on, or adhere to, the surface and thereafter continue to grow on the surface resulting in deteriorated performance of the equipment and process. The materials are specifically selected using a method that takes into account the dielectric spectra of the fluid to which the surface is exposed and the surface itself. It has been unexpectedly found that if the dielectric spectra of the surface and the fluid are matched to within relative agreement, there should be no adhesion of the foulant on the surface. In some embodiments, the dielectric spectra to be matched include the intrinsic indexes of refraction."
MIT,Spectrally Multiplexed Solid State Quantum Emitters and Memories for QuantumRepeaters,Case number: #22414,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/spectrally-multiplexed-solid-state-quantum-emitters,"A spectrally multiplexed quantum repeater (SMuQR) based on spatially arrayed nodes of frequency-multiplexed multi-qubit registers uses the natural inhomogeneous distribution of optical transition frequencies in solid state defect centers. This distribution enables spectrally selective, individual addressing of large numbers of defect centers within an optical diffraction limited spot along a long cavity or waveguide. The spectral selection relies on frequency shifting an incident optical field at a rate as fast as once per defect center lifetime. The defect centers are resonant at visible frequencies and emit visible single photons which are down-converted to a wavelength compatible with long-distance transmission via conventional optical fiber. The down-converted photons are all at the same telecommunications wavelength, with the different spectral bins mapped to different temporal bins to preserve the multiplexing in the time domain, for distribution to other nodes in the quantum network."
MIT,NoiseRecycling,Case number: #22102J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/noise-recycling,"Described are concepts, systems, devices and methods that enhance decoding performance of channels subject to correlated noise. The concepts, systems, devices and methods can be used with any combination of codes, code-rates and decoding techniques. In embodiments, a continuous realization of effective noise is estimated from a lead channel by subtracting its decoded output from its received signal. This estimate is then used to improve the accuracy of decoding of an otherwise orthogonal channel that is experiencing correlated effective noise. In this approach, channels aid each other through the post-decoding provision of estimates of effective noise. In some embodiments, the lead channel is not pre-determined, but is chosen dynamically based on which of a plurality of decoders completes first, or using soft information including an estimate of effective noise that is least energetic or most likely to have occurred."
MIT,Cancellation of Unwanted Interactions in a Superconducting QuantumArchitecture,Case number: #21852J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/cancellation-unwanted-interactions-superconducting,"A quantum circuit called a “qumon” is provided to cancel unwanted ZZ interaction in a superconducting qubit architecture. The qumon qubit has a high coherence, and a positive anharmonicity that may be tuned to cancel the negative anharmonicity in a coupled qubit, such as a transmon qubit. The qumon has three parallel branches, in which are a shunt capacitor; a Josephson junction having weighted energy level and capacitance; and several Josephson junctions in series. The weight is chosen to provide the desired anharmonicity, and the transverse flux noise and transverse charge noise each decrease in proportion to the number of the Josephson junctions in series. Because unwanted ZZ interactions are canceled, qumon qubits and transmon qubits may be capacitively coupled in an alternating pattern to provide a surface code in which these interactions are canceled in an extensible way."

The two-photon logic gate catches photons in and releases photons from de-coupled cavity modes in response to electronic or photonic control signals. This “catch-and-release” two-photon gate can be formed in semiconductor photonic integrated circuit (PIC) that operates at room temperature. When combined with sources, linear circuits, other logic gates, and detectors, it can be used to make a quantum computer with up to 1000 error-corrected logical qubits on a cm2 PIC, with full qubit connectivity to avoid overhead.

MIT,Method for SBS Suppression and Electronic Pathlength Matching in Coherent BeamCombining,Case number: #22202L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/method-sbs-suppression-and-electronic-pathlength,"In coherent beam combining, the beams can be phase-modulated with a pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS) to prevent stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) downstream. To coherently combine the phase-modulated beams, however, the PRBS waveforms should be true-time-delayed to within a small fraction of the bit duration. Traditionally, this true time delay is achieved by cutting optical fibers to length or with optical trombones. But trimming fibers is hard to do precisely, and optical trombones have large insertion loss. In addition, the path length mismatch varies as the fibers heat up and/or vibrate. Here, the beams are generated from a kilohertz linewidth seed split among N>1 (e.g., N=100) arms. Each arm is phase-modulated with a separate copy of the unique PRBS pattern. The relative phase of the PRBS patterns is stabilized by phase-locking the master oscillators used to read out the PRBS patterns. The PRBS patterns can be phase shifted with respect to one another to compensate for physical path length mismatches of the optical fibers. Scanning the relative phase of the PRBS pattern used to modulate different arms yields a cross-correlation peak in combined power when the phases are matched at the combination plane."

MIT,From Big (GPS) Data to a SearchableDiary,Case number: #15677,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/big-gps-data-searchable-diary,"The Inventors have developed iDiary, a patented system that turns large GPS signals collected from smart-phones into textual descriptions of the trajectories. The system features a user interface similar to Google Search that allows users to type text queries on their activities (e.g. “Where did I buy books?”) and receive textual answers based on GPS signals. This technology can help to track urban movement patterns to better model and forecast global activities in a community—for example, to understand spatial trends (where people are aggregating), temporal trends (when people go where) and other urban characteristics (e.g. speed of traffic flow, travel time, etc.)\n\nTechnology: Once a user installs iDiary on their iPhone, the application collects GPS-points (traces/signal) and transmits them to the Inventors’ lab server. This is done in the background using location services of the iPhone. Since these services consume large amount of power, the GPS such off when the user is stationary for ten minutes. When the server receives the user’s GPS points, it compresses them for efficient storage and to speed up the text-search algorithm. The linear simplification of the signal is used for constructed its semantic compression (coreset) that consists of the k-segment mean with a “smart” non-uniform sample of weighted representative GPS-points. Coresets are calculated in a streaming setting to result in a constant-sized coreset for a user’s data that is continually updated with new data points. When the user runs a text query search on their iPhone, the terms in the query are translated into a (sparse) vector of code words. This vector is projected on the semantic space and replaced by its (dense) semantic j-vector of activities. On the semantic space, the application computes the similar documents (closet vectors) to the query and returns them.\n\nProblem Addressed: Trends in population movement/mobility are important aspects of urban life that can motivate new predictive models of population activity at the individual or community level. However, mining large amounts of GPS data into useful, human-readable information is difficult due to the relative lack of prior work and the UI of existing GPS applications that target map-navigation over text search. The Inventors take on this challenge with “iDiary,” a novel patent-pending system that processes data collected from a sensor network of mobile phones, extracts the semantic meaning of a user/community’s main activities and trends, and provides a text-based UI that allows easy search and management of this information.\n\nAdvantages: First system to provide intuitive, text-based search and retrieval of GPS-based information without having to rely on maps or databases. Algorithms for semantic compression and trajectory clustering of massive GPS-signals compute critical locations of a user within provable error bounds"

The resulting customized design provides the blueprints for fabrication: a folding pattern and a corresponding circuit design for each component, based on the robot’s desired properties and physical characteristics.A modeling engine is associated with each component in the database. This engine selects the approximate desired parameters that match the user specification, for example, to create an insect robot with 6 legs, capable of carrying a radon sensor and covering a 200 m2 space within 24 hours. The design is instantiated with the parameters from the modeling engine, and the fabrication process begins. The circuit mask is printed on a flat sheet with a copper tape overlay, using a solid-ink printer, and is etched with ferric chloride. The process continues with the pick-and-place assembly of circuit components that cannot be incorporated in the printing process. The folding pattern is printed on the 2D sheet, after which the 3D robot is folded and the necessary actuators are added for function.\n\nProblem Addressed: To date, there is no single end-to-end process which begins with a user specifying a desired task and ends with a fully functional robot able to perform that task. The Inventors have created a method for fabricating “printable” robots that are inexpensive to operate and require minimal technical knowledge by the user to create. In this implementation, 2D components are produced via printers, laser cutters, etc. and 3D robots are assembled through origami-like folding of these components. This printable method streamlines the design and permits the use of cheap and easy-to-operate tools, enabling the rapid and low-cost fabrication of robots. The general process links specifications to prototypes, without requiring in-depth technical knowledge from user.\n\nAdvantages: Extensible database can be updated as users design and fabricate new robots. Low-cost, simple and fast fabrication (prototypes fabricated in under 4 hours). Fabrication does not require the user to have detailed technical knowledge"
MIT,Strain-engineered Artificial Atom as a Broad-spectrum Solar EnergyFunnel,Case number: #15741J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/strain-engineered-artificial-atom-broad-spectrum,"Applications for this technology are found in photovoltaics, light emission, photocatalysis, and photon-detection.\n\nTechnology: This invention involves optoelectronic devices that can interact with light and facilitate the generation and collection of charge carriers, e.g., electrical current, associated with a broad range of wavelengths. Specifically, inhomogeneous strain as applied to atomically thin materials has been discovered to be an important vehicle to enable the collection and/or emission of a broad range of wavelengths as compared to prior materials operating at a single wavelength. This ability to interact with a range of wavelengths, as compared to a single wavelength, greatly increases the device's efficiency.In one example, an optoelectronic device may include a first optoelectronic material that is inhomogeneously strained. First and second charge carrier collectors are then electrically connected to the inhomogeneously strained material to collect charge carriers into the material to either generate a current or produce light. In addition to collecting and generating light, these materials can also be used to provide an engineered material for a range of different photocatalysis reactions using the same base material by simply adjusting the applied strain.Furthermore, the strong coupling between mechanical strain/stress and optoelectronic responses make these materials useful for local mechanical strain, stress, and force sensing via optical and electronic signals.\n\nProblem Addressed: Typical photovoltaic materials are only capable of collecting a single wavelength of radiation to produce a current. This restriction of typical devises inherently limits the possible efficacy of a photovoltaic device. Further, unlike atomically thin materials, typical bulk materials are unable to sustain large enough elastic strains to significantly affect their ability to absorb different wavelengths of light before the onset of plasticity or fracture.\n\nAdvantages: Controlled band gap in optoelectric materials at a low cost. Multiple wavelengths of radiation can be utilized, thus increasing device efficiency. Multiple photocatalysis reactions can be facilitated using the same material by using different applied strains. Atomically thin membranes are a notable family of materials that exhibit ultrastrength qualities; for instance, they can resist inelastic relaxation up to a significant fraction of their ideal strength. Ultrathin local mechanical strain, stress, and force sensor with tunable ultrafine spatial resolution"
MIT,Cyclotron Phase-Lock LoopControl,Case number: #15762,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/cyclotron-phase-lock-loop-control,"Ultra light and magnetically shielded, high current compact cyclotrons with superconducting magnets have useful applications to a range of medical, scientific, and security applications. For example, radiation beam therapy, nuclear medicine uses, and nuclear materials testing are all areas where this technology could be useful.\n\nTechnology: To promote optimal beam acceleration, these phase-lock loop synchronization techniques use feedback in the RF field to increase cyclotron current. This phase-controlling technique requires an optimized system of a source to monitor the beam during the acceleration phase. Such control systems require beam sensors and mechanisms located at the dees gap to accordingly adjust RF phase. The RF source phase (φsource) that optimizes beam acceleration depends on a function of sensor, beam-gap, beam, RF, and optimal phases. Additionally, use of a pulsed ion source made from appropriate materials (i.e. made of stable compounds that do not breakdown, employ an ablator that does not leave deposits or require maintenance operation) promotes matching of ion source to the acceptance window of the RF in cyclotrons.\n\nProblem Addressed: Synchrocyclotrons require adjustments to the frequency of radio frequency (RF) fields during beam acceleration due to the relativistic effects that change the mass of accelerated particles. Conventional efforts to monitor and control frequency occur after the extraction phase. These efforts lack real-time monitoring and appropriate synchronization of adjustments during the acceleration phase. Addressing the frequency of RF fields in the acceleration phase serves to substantially improve beam quality and promote optimal acceleration. These cyclotron improvements synchronize RF and beam phases to optimize acceleration of particles for efficient beam extraction. Such improvements for high current cyclotron design offer significant advantages for relevant applications, especially when coupled with other improvements such as use of magnetic field coils, magnetic shielding, and superconducting materials.\n\nAdvantages: Closed loop control enables variation of final beam energy. Maintains high extraction efficiency"
MIT,Bi-Directional Porous Media Phase Change HeatExchanger,Case number: #16768,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/bi-directional-porous-media-phase-change-heat,"A heat-storing battery for heating and cooling applications that can be recharged with waste heat. The technology provides a compact, high cycle-life cooling and heating strategy to provide on-demand climate control. Among other applications, the system could be used to extend the driving range of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) by providing heating or cooling without draining the on-board electric battery bank. The advanced thermo-adsorptive battery (ATB) could also be integrated into residential or commercial structures, where it would provide environmentally-friendly heating and cooling via the capture and reuse of waste heat.\n\nTechnology: The technology uses novel zeolite and metal oxide framework adsorbent materials to achieve high vapor sorption capacities and sorption rates at low relative pressures, which can potentially increase the driving range of an EV by 30% compared to contemporary climate control technology. These zeolites are synthesized from the parent Sodium Y-type (NaY) zeolites, which are subjected to an aqueous solution allowing ion-exchange. They are then rinsed with deionized water and allowed to dry in ambient air. The ion-exchange and rinsing are performed multiple times depending on the desired final structure. Additionally, a methanol aqueous solution is used in these ATBs to prevent adsorbate freezing at low temperatures. Furthermore, the novel design of the thermal battery enhances heat and mass transport for most efficient utilization of the high-performance materials. The overall system design is flexible and modular, and the technology can be easily scaled to meet heating and cooling demands of large commercial and residential units.\n\nProblem Addressed: The energy storage densities of electric batteries are much lower than those of gasoline and other liquid fuels, and there are few effective alternatives for direct storage of heat. The use of traditional electrically-powered climate control systems severely limits the driving range of many BEVs. Additionally, electrically-powered heating and cooling systems for residential and commercial structures are a major cause of grid overload in many parts of the U.S.A.\n\nAdvantages: Energy storage density: provides high-capacity heat storage with little or no electrical power consumption. Enhanced heat and mass transfer: offers rapid charging, controlled discharge and better adsorbent utilization than conventional adsorption-based climate control systems. Environmentally friendly: system can be recharged using waste heat, and uses water and alcohol rather than harmful and polluting HCFC refrigerants"
MIT,Characterizing Multipath Delays in Antenna Array and Synthetic Aperture RadarSystems,Case number: #16799,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/characterizing-multipath-delays-antenna-array-and,"This technology is amenable to commercial applications that involve resolving the delays of multiple paths in an antenna array or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems. For instance, it can be used to identify the line of sight path for localizing a wireless transmitter based on antenna arrays (e.g., to localize LTE or Wi-Fi devices) or to analyze the multipath of wireless signals from a transmitter (e.g., to measure the power received from a particular reflector, relative to others).\n\nTechnology: This technology enables a receiving wireless node to measure the relative delay of different OFDM signal paths resolved using antenna arrays or synthetic aperture radar techniques. This is achieved by leveraging the fact that a delay in the time domain of an OFDM signal path translates to a rotation in phase of the received signal, across OFDM subcarriers. This indicates that the slope of the phase of a received OFDM channel measured across subcarriers captures the delay of this signal in the time-domain, and therefore, measuring the difference in these slopes can provide the relative delay between two OFDM signal paths. This approach is particularly advantageous given that a small delay in time, even less than one OFDM time sample (i.e., the time corresponding to a single sample at the OFDM receiver) can still be measured based on the difference in slopes.\n\nProblem Addressed: SAR is a technique in which successive pulses of radio waves are transmitted from a transceiver to “illuminate” a target scene, and the echo of each pulse is received and recorded at the transceiver. Localization of radio frequency reflectors or transmitters may be complicated by the presence of reflecting structures that cause there to be multiple paths from a target object to a receiver. The Inventors have developed a technology that enables identifying the relative delays of different paths of a signal measured by an OFDM wireless receiver from a wireless transmitter, using SAR techniques for applications in localization, gesture sensing or imaging, to identify the line-of-sight path, or to analyze possible sources of multipath in the environment.\n\nAdvantages: Solution can be extended to other frequency division technologies (e.g., FDM) where the wireless channel is available at the receiver across independent frequencies"

The nanosensor is comprised of a novel composition of phenylboronic acid polymer complexed with SWNT. This polymer is formed using reversible addition forward chain transfer polymerization and is used to impart water solubility and saccharide sensitivity to individual SWNT fluorophores. Furthermore, this sensing mechanism is confirmed as occurring nearly instantaneously, as is demonstrated by transient measurements. The selectivity of these complexes is distinct from that of free boronic acid moieties. Moreover, polymers having different phenylboronic acid derivatives and molecular weights can impart distinct saccharide or other analyte binding profiles when coupled to SWNT. As such, this complex represents an intriguing new class of sensors, which may be utilized for blood glucose monitoring or other diagnostic sensing applications.\n\nProblem Addressed: Blood glucose detection is of critical importance for patients suffering from diabetes mellitus, a disease currently effecting 347 million people worldwide. Developing reliable, sensitive and durable sensors with which individuals can monitor and control the potential life-threatening effects of this disease remains a heavily researched topic.\n\nAdvantages: Long lifetime.

MIT,Ingestible Electronic Pills for HormoneModulation,Case number: #22427,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/ingestible-electronic-pills-hormone-modulation,"The gut-brain axis, which is mediated via enteric and central neurohormonal signaling, is known to regulate a broad set of physiological functions from feeding to emotional behavior. Various pharmaceuticals and surgical interventions, such as motility agents and bariatric surgery, are used to modulate this axis. Such approaches, however, are associated with off-target effects or post-procedure recovery time and expose patients to substantial risks. Electrical stimulation has also been used to attempt to modulate the gut-brain axis with greater spatial and temporal resolution. Electrical stimulation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, however, has generally required invasive intervention for electrode placement on serosal tissue. Stimulating mucosal tissue remains challenging because of the presence of gastric and intestinal fluid, which can influence the effectiveness of local luminal stimulation. Here, we report the development of a bioinspired ingestible fluid-wicking capsule for active stimulation and hormone modulation (FLASH) capable of rapidly wicking fluid and locally stimulating mucosal tissue, resulting in systemic modulation of an orexigenic GI hormone. Drawing inspiration from Moloch horridus, the “thorny devil” lizard with water-wicking skin, we developed a capsule surface capable of displacing fluid. We characterized the stimulation parameters for modulation of various GI hormones in a porcine model and applied these parameters to an ingestible capsule system. FLASH can be orally administered to modulate GI hormones and is safely excreted with no adverse effects in porcine models.

However, such extreme operating conditions pose severe challenges to the heat exchanger design. Although recently developed superalloys and ceramics can survive high-temperature and high-pressure loads, using these materials in a traditional heat exchanger design requires high cost and yields low power density. In this work, we propose an ultrahigh power density ceramic heat exchanger for high-temperature applications enabled by a multiscale porous design. By optimizing the design of centimeter-scale macrochannels and microchannels, significant improvement to both heat transfer and structural strength is predicted, with a negligible pressure drop penalty (< 1%). Based on finite element simulations, an optimized heat exchanger core design is expected to achieve power densities of 717 MW/m3 and 300 kW/kg, which indicates more than 2.5× enhancement in thermal performance compared to printed-circuit heat exchanger design.

Where the photoactive regime is a material composition that has a suitable flat band potential that can induce photochemical reactions without biased potential, and the photosensitive regime is a dye that sufficiently anchors to the photoactive surface to shift the materials bandgap to a useful spectrum. In addition to TiO2 a wide range of photoactive materials have shown altered wettability upon UV light irradiation such as ZnO, SnO2­, WO3, V2O5, SrTiO3, CeO2, etc. Similarly, there are a number of possible photosensitizers or dyes for this technology including N3, Z907, Z907Na, N719, Z910, N621, K19, K59, etc. For each of these composition regimes there are a number of synthesis methods that can be used such as the sol-gel method, the hydrothermal method, aerosol deposition, spray pyrolysis, chemical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition, electro-deposition, direct oxidation, magnetron sputtering, spincoating, dipcoating, anodic oxidation and templating. Using combinations of these synthesis methods allows amplification of the wettability switching via texturing the photoactive surface to contain nanotube arrays, inverse opal three-dimensional structures, nanorod arrays, and/or nanopores followed by coating the photoactive surface with the photosensitive dyes to shift the absorbance spectra to the more useful visible regime.\n\nProblem Addressed: Photoactive materials, such as titanium dioxide (TiO­­2), have attracted significant attention due to their ability to switch wettability upon irradiation of UV light. However, the large band gap in these materials limits their ability to absorb light effectively. Although doping has been demonstrated as an effective solution to enhance the visible light-induced wettability switching of photoactive materials, doping typically demands harsh conditions including high temperature, high pressure or toxic chemical environments, which limits versatility in the fabrication process. This technology is a novel approach to switch the wettability of photoactive materials to be responsive in the visible spectral regime using dye sensitization. Upon visible light irradiation, the dye sensitized photoactive surfaces undergo hydrophobic or hydrophilic conversion in both air and oil environments.\n\nAdvantages: Reduced toxicity in synthesis. Increased tunability for specific applications"

MIT,Decoding via GuessingNoise,Case number: #20169J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/decoding-guessing-noise,"Digital data often suffers corruption from noise during transmission or storage. The addition of redundancy by an error correction code seeks to combat the damaging effects of corruption. Codes require reconstruction of the original data through decoding. GRAND™ is a novel approach to decoding that improves on existing methods. Traditional decoders are narrowly tailored to exclusively work with specific codes, resulting in a proliferation of decoding hardware. For reasons of decoding complexity, existing codes are generally excessively redundant, making them wasteful and unsuitable for low energy, low latency or high throughput systems such as IoT, 5G, and optical networks. Exceptionally, GRAND™ can efficiently and precisely decode all moderate to low redundancy codes. GRAND™ obviates the need for multiple decoders. It enables backward compatibility with legacy codes and unfettered innovation in introducing new codes. GRAND™ has been shown in silicon to be energy efficient. GRAND™ is applicable in many different industries including AR/VR, low latency gaming, IoT, 5G networks, optical networks, and many others.\n\nTechnology: The GRAND™ method decodes data based on identifying the noise effect, rather than attempting to extract codewords directly from the noise impacted encoded data as existing methods do. The GRAND™ approach contains three main processes that are repeated until a decoding is obtained. Noise effect sequences are sequentially generated in decreasing order of likelihood either a priori based on a statistical channel model or using soft information, such as can be obtained in reception of communication signals. In order, GRAND™ takes a noise effect sequence, inverts its effect from a possibly noise-corrupted signal (e.g., by subtracting or using some other method of operational inversion), and queries whether the resulting data are a valid codeword, using the code merely as a validator or hash. The first instance of code-word identification is the decoding. By mirroring the noisy channel, GRAND™ provides optimally accurate maximum likelihood decoding of arbitrary codes with moderate redundancy that can be chosen to perfectly match system characteristics.\n\nProblem Addressed: Digital data is subjected to errors when stored or transmitted owing to the effects of noise on the medium or communication channel. The solution is to add redundancy to the data on storage or transmission via an error correction code so that, at the time of retrieval of the data, decoding can undo the noise effect and correctly recover the original data.\n\nAdvantages: Decodes any moderate redundancy code, regardless of structure and length, with provably maximal accuracy. Variants have been established for both soft and hard detection systems. Is inherently highly parallelizable, resulting in desirably low latency. Can be used in channels experiencing noise bursts without the need for interleaving. A hard detection implementation in silicon has proven energy efficient universality"

It may be used for monitoring physiological signals such as gastric pH and glucose levels, helping patients comply with drug treatment regimens, or for treating obesity through bariatric intervention.\n\nTechnology: This inflatable hydrogel capsule is designed to be compressed and stored within a smaller pill that dissolves in the stomach. Once the outer pill dissolves, the hydrogel capsule retains gastric fluid through macropores on a tough, stretchable hydrogel membrane. There is a superabsorbent polymer within the membrane that swells up to 100 times its original volume within 10 minutes. The swelling speed can be tuned by adjusting the particle size of the superabsorbent polymer, and the final volume can be tuned by adjusting the amount of superabsorbent polymers within the capsule. Once fully inflated, the tough hydrogel membrane is robust enough to ensure long-term integrity within the acidic, compressive environment within the stomach. Finally, the hydrogel balloon can be deflated by ingesting calcium chloride. The remaining empty shell can then safely exit through the pylorus.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current ingestible, inflatable hydrogel pills take several days to expand, and only reach a final volume up to 10 times their original size. This makes them susceptible to passing through the body. They also tend to be soft, and lack the strength to withstand compressive forces within the stomach. There is a need for a capsule that is small enough to be swallowed comfortably but large enough to avoid being passed out of the stomach through the pylorus.

SLC46A3. expression showed strong association with high liposomal nanoparticle uptake. This inverse relationship is consistent across multiple cancer cell types and lineages as well as liposomal nano-formulations, thus establishing. SLC46A3. expression as a cancer-agnostic biomarker. This relationship was validated. in vivo. via intravenous and intratumoral injection of a liposomal nanoparticle formulation using an engineered melanoma mouse model. Notably, in patient tumor data, cancer cells expressing low levels of. SLC46A3. are associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes and poor prognosis. Therefore, strategic integration of this biomarker into patient cohort selection during clinical trials could potentially minimize non-uniform biological response to nanoparticles, thereby providing a more uniform clinical readout of the investigational drug.\n\nProblem Addressed: Nanoparticles have gained momentum in the world of nanomedicine but face challenges in translation to clinical practice. Today, nanoparticles are the go-to delivery vehicles for a broad range of therapeutic modalities – from chemotherapeutic agents to CRISPR-based drug complexes and mRNA vaccines.

This composition facilitates remote omnidirectional steering and navigation of the robot through a desired path, such as the neurovascular system. To reduce friction while the robot navigates through complex and constrained environments, the surface of the robot can be coated with a thin layer of hydrophilic polymers for lubrication. To expand the robot’s medical applications, various functional cores can be incorporated inside of the soft composite matrix. For example, one or a bundle of optical fibers can be included to enable imaging, illumination, or laser delivery.\n\nProblem Addressed: Robotic systems present a novel strategy for remotely controlled, minimally invasive surgical procedures, such as stroke intervention. However, conventional robots are comprised of a series of rigid links, joints, and actuators; this composition limits their mobility and is unsuitable for navigating through narrow and complex systems such as the cerebrovascular anatomy to reach target lesions. Continuum robots, in contrast, are built with flexible materials, and they can achieve complex motion through their ability to bend upon deformation. It should be noted that existing continuum robots still contain some rigid components and are limited to millimeter scales due to miniaturization challenges of conventional actuation mechanisms. This invention is a submillimeter-scale, soft-bodied continuum robot capable of steering and navigating through complex and constrained environments upon remote actuation by externally applied magnetic fields.\n\nAdvantages: Submillimeter-scale of robot is optimal for minimally invasive procedures. Better steerability than conventional robots due to exclusion of rigid components. Ferromagnetic particles allow robot to be steered remotely. Incorporation of various functional cores allows for diverse surgical functions. Teleoperable to enable remote surgery in rural areas with limited access to hospitals"

Unfortunately, most fiber pigtail arrays are not aligned well enough for coherently combining different optical beams. This imprecision stems in part from misalignment between the optical fiber and the endcap spliced to the end of the optical fiber. The endcap is often polished, curved, or patterned, causing the light emitted by the endcapped fiber to refract or diffract as it exits the endcap. This refraction or diffraction shifts the apparent position of the beam waist from its actual position. Measuring this virtual beam waist position before and after splicing the endcap to the fiber increases the absolute precision with which the fiber is aligned to the endcap. This increase in absolute precision reduces the deviation in virtual beam waist position among endcapped fibers, making it easier to produce arrays of endcapped fibers aligned precisely enough for coherent beam combining."
MIT,Data-Driven Angular Jitter Estimator forLidar,Case number: #21433L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/data-driven-angular-jitter-estimator-lidar,"Space-based ground-imaging lidar has become increasingly feasible with recent advances in compact fiber lasers and single-photon-sensitive Geiger-mode detector arrays. A challenge with such a system is imperfect pointing knowledge caused by angular jitter, exacerbated by long distances between the satellite and the ground. Unless mitigated, angular jitter blurs the 3D lidar data. Unfortunately, using mechanical isolation, advanced IMUs, star trackers, or auxiliary passive optical sensors to reduce the error in pointing knowledge increases size, weight, power, and/or cost. Here, the 2-axis jitter time series is estimated from the lidar data. Simultaneously, a single-surface model of the ground is estimated as nuisance parameters. Expectation Maximization separates signal and background detections, while maximizing the joint posterior probability density of the jitter and surface states. The resulting estimated jitter, when used in coincidence processing or image reconstruction, can reduce the blurring effect of jitter to an amount comparable to the optical diffraction limit."

MIT,Article for Enhanced Boiling HeatTransfer,Case number: #15714,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/article-enhanced-boiling-heat-transfer,"The current technology can be applied towards improving boiling processes in many industrial applications. This includes enhancing boiler and steam components such as tanks, pipes and reactors in facilities such as power plants, desalination systems or oil and gas fields.\n\nTechnology: This invention finds that scale formation can in fact be positive for boiling, as it enhances a type of boiling called nucleate boiling. Nucleate boiling has a heat transfer coefficient of up to an order of magnitude greater than regular filmwise boiling. The presence of scale can thus improve boiling heat transfer, but only if this scale formation is deposited appropriately. The current technology proposes methods to maintain a scale deposit at a controlled thickness (e.g., below a maximum thickness, within a desired range, or in a certain pattern) that can improve the nucleation site density and bubble formation, which both serve to enhance nucleate boiling. These methods include applying a photoactive coating to promote scale growth or controlling growth via water chemistry or mechanical removal. The technology also recommends a specific set of scale materials (e.g., calcium carbonate, barium sulfate), deposition thicknesses and deposition patterns that can promote this nucleate boiling.\n\nProblem Addressed: In many industrial applications, the process of boiling can result in unwanted byproducts (such as calcium sulfate in oil wells) accumulating on the boiling surface.

MIT,Integrated Track-and-Receive System for Free-Space OpticalCommunications,Case number: #22167,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/integrated-track-and-receive-system-free-space,"A monostatic, beaconless fiber transceiver for free-space optical links infers fine tracking information using receiver optoelectronics and an injected pointing dither (nutation). A MEMS steering mirror fine-points the beams and injects the nutation. While this may disturb fiber coupling and transmit beam pointing, link loss becomes negligible for sufficient SNR. The SNR for links without point-ahead correction is about 35 dB to keep dither loss below 0.1 dB and RMS spacial tracking noise below a tenth of the beam divergence. Since the pointing and tracking bandwidth is much smaller than the receiver communication bandwidth, this SNR is achievable with appropriate filtering. For point-ahead correction, a single-mode fiber transceiver can reach up to about 1 beamwidth of correction, while a few-mode fiber transceiver can reach up to about 1.75 beamwidths due to improved coupling sensitivity at higher point-ahead offsets. Using a double-clad fiber with a secondary detector further reduces the incurring coupling loss."

The microcavities can be implemented as photonic crystal cavities or micro-disks that are thermally coupled to strong mid-IR or LWIR absorbers, such as pyrolytic carbon columns. Each microcavity and the associated absorber(s) rest on hollow pillars that extend from a substrate and thermally isolate the cavity and the absorber(s) from the rest of the bolometer. This ensures that thermal transfer to the absorbers is predominantly from radiation as opposed to from conduction. As the absorbers absorb thermal radiation, they shift the resonance wavelength of the cavity.

This algorithm works to find patterns in a scene under translation, and can be applied to both one or multi-dimensional patterns and scenes. The inventors focus the application to one-dimensional analysis for GPS synchronization with reduced complexity and power consumption.\n\nTechnology: More recent GPS receivers lock on a satellite signal using frequency domain computation. In this process, the receiver takes the Fourier transform of a received signal. Then multiplies the output of this transform a code corresponding to the specific satellite and performs the inverse FFT on the resulting signal. This 3-step process mathematically ensures that the output of the inverse FFT will spike at the correct shift that synchronizes the code with the received signal. The computational complexity of this approach is O(n log n). For the past two decades, this has been the algorithm with the lowest computational complexity for synchronizing a GPS receiver.The Inventors’ algorithm builds on recent developments in the growing area of sparse recovery. It exploits the sparse nature of the synchronization problem, where only the correct alignment between the received GPS signal and the satellite code causes their cross-correlation to spike. This single spike can be filtered with a simple sublinear algorithm to reduce complexity of the inverse FFT step. The algorithm proceeds by aligning several numbers into one, by summing them up, reducing the sizes of the pattern and the scene to improve algorithm efficiency. FFT is calculated for only this minimized subset of frequencies, further reducing complexity.\n\nProblem Addressed: GPS is among the most widely used satellite systems, incorporated in devices ranging from smartphones, navigation systems, sensors, digital cameras, and bio chips. A GPS receiver calculates its position by locking onto and synchronizing with nearby satellite signals. This synchronization process is quite costly and requires hundreds of millions of hardware multiplications, leading to high power consumption. Many GPS-enabled devices have strict power limitations and would significantly benefit from reducing the complexity of the process. The fastest known algorithm for this problem is based on the Fourier transform and has a complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of signal samples. The Inventors have developed an even faster GPS synchronization algorithm that reduces the locking complexity to O(n√log n). Further, if the SNR is above a threshold, the algorithm becomes linear (i.e., O(n).\n\nAdvantages: Invention present the fastest GPS synchronization algorithm to date, with complexity O(n√log n).

Control of beam shape enables mode matching between source output mode and target input mode, which results in low-loss optical coupling. An inventive freeform reflective surface can direct light beams in plane or out of plane via specular reflection or total internal reflection. A photonic integrated circuit with this type of freeform optical coupler can operate with a bandwidth range of at least 400 nm, potentially encompassing all visible or telecommunications wavelengths, and can be volume manufactured in photonic chips."

MIT,Slot Antennas for Graphene Mid-IR Imaging Arrays as well an Approach for CMOS ImplementationThereof,Case number: #21104,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/slot-antennas-graphene-mid-ir-imaging-arrays-well,"A filter-based color imaging array that resolves N different colors detects only 1/N th of the incoming light. In the thermal infrared wavelength range, filtering loss is exacerbated by the lower sensor detectivity at infrared wavelengths than at visible wavelengths. To avoid loss due to filtering, most spectral imagers use bulky optics, such as diffraction gratings or Fourier transform interferometers, to resolve different colors. Fortunately, it is possible to avoid filtering loss without bulky optics: detect light with interleaved arrays of sub-wavelength-spaced antennas tuned to different wavelengths. An optically sensitive element inside each antenna absorbs light at the antenna's resonant wavelength. Metallic slot antennas offer high efficiency, intrinsic unidirectionality, and lower cross-talk than dipole or bowtie antennas. Graphene serves at the optically active material inside each antenna because its 2D nature makes it easily adaptable to this imager architecture."

This improvement is highly relevant to purification of pharmaceuticals, recovery of solvents and catalysts for reuse, and the separation of crude oil mixtures.\n\nTechnology: The invention at hand is a means to produce OSN membranes of unprecedented performance using a mature method compatible with low-cost and scalable roll-to-roll fabrication. The method applied is interfacial polymerization, in which an alternating polymer of aqueous and organic soluble monomers is formed at the interface between aqueous and organic solutions thereof. The inventors have identified a suitable pair of such monomers to produce a polymer of optimal characteristics for OSN. The essential design principle is the use of monomers containing bulky structures so the resulting polymer cannot pack efficiently, leaving voids through which solvent may pass even with the dense defect-free polymer network necessary to prevent defects and engender solvent resistance. The resulting material is known as a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM). This invention describes the first PIM synthesized by interfacial polymerization to which both the aqueous and organic soluble monomers contribute microporosity-inducing steric bulk, thereby achieving unprecedented solvent permeability during the filtration of molecules of modest molecular weight (~600 g/mol).\n\nProblem Addressed: The separation of organic solvents from solutes using currently commercialized methods is an energy intensive process. Simply filtering solutes out of organic solvents would improve energy efficiency and reduce material waste, mitigating costs and environmental impacts. This approach, known as organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN), currently has limited commercial application due to the absence of filtration membranes that combine the following necessary characteristics:\n\nAdvantages: Efficient separation small molecules from organic solvents.

Laser-reduction is a new technique that operates at lower temperatures and with greater energy efficiency than previous methods for electrode synthesis. This technology further incorporates machine-learning to automate the discovery and optimization of the resulting materials.\n\nTechnology: This technology describes a novel method that enables the efficient laser-reduction of novel electrode materials, including PAN. First, the polymer is heat treated to prevent its destruction during lasing. Next, the polymer is micro structured (i.e. etched) to minimize damage from thermal stresses during lasing. An added advantage of laser-reduction is that the morphology, and therefore the properties, of the electrode may be tuned by varying the manufacturing conditions. This technology further includes the integration of machine-learning to automate the manufacturing process. Using Bayesian optimization, 20 candidate lasing conditions may be tested. Finally, the properties of the output materials are measured, and the results are processed to modify conditions for a subsequent lasing test sheet. This process is repeated for multiple cycles until the properties of the material have been optimized.\n\nProblem Addressed: The performance and properties of carbon electrodes vary depending on the manufacturing method. Their synthesis typically requires an energy intensive carbonization step. Laser-reduction is an emerging, alternative manufacturing method that offers improved energy efficiency. However, certain materials like polyacrylonitrile (PAN) pose challenges in terms of their compatibility with the laser process. Furthermore, optimization of the lasing conditions to improve the properties of the resulting electrodes is a slow and time-consuming process. Methods that enable laser-reduction of cheap, commercially available polymers, such as PAN, and accelerate the optimization of the manufacturing conditions are necessary to reduce production costs.\n\nAdvantages: More energy efficient due to omitting a high-temperature carbonization step.. Utilizes commercially available polymers that were previously thought to be incompatible with laser-reduction.. Machine-learning automates optimization of the electrode properties during manufacture."

By using a protein binding approach, rather than the traditional additives present in many modern hair care products, the chemicals that can be harmful to hair are removed. Therefore, the risk for damaged hair or an allergic reaction is reduced. Additionally, due to natural coloration that can be implemented when engineering the proteins, this technology can serve as the foundation for natural hair dyes that will strengthen hair, rather than damage it. This results in much longer-lasting treatment, without making hair feel oily or damaging it with chemicals.\n\nProblem Addressed: Hair can be damaged by age, repeated washing, heat, or existing hair care products like dyes. This technology introduces hair care products integrated with engineered protein analogues to natural hair proteins. This results in the repair of damaged hair.

Filler nanoparticles like graphene are able to create lightweight composite materials, since only small volumes are needed to achieve robust mechanical reinforcement. These composite materials are not only lightweight, but they are also able to maintain the electrical and optical properties of their filler material.\n\nTechnology: The first fabrication method described by this invention uses polycarbonate (PC) as the polymer matrix and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of graphene to generate up to 320 layers of aligned graphene/polycarbonate (G/PC) composites of 0.032 to 0.11 mm thickness. The composites have high optical transmittance, ranging from 90% at nine layers of G/PC to 58% at 36 layers and PC matrix reinforcement is the result of direct load transfer to the graphene filler, not stiffening of the PC polymer matrix. The second fabrication method uses transverse shear scrolling of single G/PC films to generate spiral nanocomposite fibers of 0.10 to 0.16 mm diameter. These fibers have elasticity and tensile strength 30 times greater than Kevlar.\n\nProblem Addressed: Inserting closely spaced and distinctly separated nanoparticles within a material, which is the fundamental requirement for strengthening materials, has proven to be exceedingly difficult. For a platelet filler such as graphene, a closely-spaced stack of aligned, semi-infinite plates of nanometer or atomic thickness is calculated to approach the limit of maximal mechanical reinforcement. Only recently has the development of methods to generate nanometer or atomic thickness films allowed for the testing of this limit of maximal mechanical reinforcement. Utilizing thin layers of molecular thickness, this invention develops two fabrication methods to generate new composite materials with the electrical and optical properties of their filler material, graphene.\n\nAdvantages: New composite materials combine and maintain the electrical and optical properties of their filler material. Relatively miniscule addition of filler needed to generate materials with new combinations of mechanical reinforcement, electrical, and optical properties. Graphene spiral fibers have 30 times greater elasticity and tensile strength than Kevlar"

MIT,Intra-Tumoral Injection of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy-Treated Tumor Cells in Combination with Systemic Immune Checkpoint Blockade for CancerTreatment,Case number: #21498H,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/intra-tumoral-injection-cytotoxic-chemotherapy,"Although immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has strong clinical benefit for treating some tumor types, it fails in others, indicating a need for additional modalities to enhance the ICB effect. Here, we identified one such modality by using DNA damage to create a live, injured tumor cell adjuvant. Using an optimized ex vivo co-culture system, we found that treating tumor cells with specific concentrations of etoposide, mitoxantrone, or doxorubicin markedly enhanced dendritic cell–mediated T cell activation. These immune-enhancing effects of DNA damage did not correlate with immunogenic cell death markers or with the extent of apoptosis or necroptosis; instead, these effects were mediated by live injured cells with activation of the DNA-PK, ATR, NF-κB, p38 MAPK, and RIPK1 signaling pathways. In mice, intra-tumoral injection of ex vivo etoposide–treated tumor cells in combination with systemic ICB (by anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies) increased the number of intra-tumoral CD103+ dendritic cells and circulating tumor-antigen–specific CD8+ T cells, decreased tumor growth, and improved survival. These effects were absent in Batf3−/− mice and in mice in which the DNA-damaging drug was injected directly into the tumor, due to DNA damage in the immune cells. The combination treatment induced complete tumor regression in a subset of mice that were then able to reject tumor re-challenge, indicating that the injured cell adjuvant treatment induced durable anti-tumor immunological memory. These results provide a strategy for enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition in tumor types that do not respond to this treatment modality by itself."
MIT,STING Agonist Delivery by Lipid Nanodiscs for TumorImmunotherapy,Case number: #21441HJ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/sting-agonist-delivery-lipid-nanodiscs-tumor,"Activation of the innate immune STimulator of INterferon Genes (STING) pathway potentiates antitumour immunity, but systemic delivery of STING agonists to tumours is challenging. We conjugated STING-activating cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) to PEGylated lipids (CDN-PEG-lipids; PEG, polyethylene glycol) via a cleavable linker and incorporated them into lipid nanodiscs (LNDs), which are discoid nanoparticles formed by self-assembly. Compared to state-of-the-art liposomes, intravenously administered LNDs carrying CDN-PEG-lipid (LND-CDNs) exhibited more efficient penetration of tumours, exposing the majority of tumour cells to STING agonist. A single dose of LND-CDNs induced rejection of established tumours, coincident with immune memory against tumour rechallenge. Although CDNs were not directly tumoricidal, LND-CDN uptake by cancer cells correlated with robust T-cell activation by promoting CDN and tumour antigen co-localization in dendritic cells. LNDs thus appear promising as a vehicle for robust delivery of compounds throughout solid tumours, which can be exploited for enhanced immunotherapy."

Quantitative T2 measurements of the lower leg of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients immediately before and after dialysis were compared to those of euvolemic healthy controls using both a 0.28 T bedside single-voxel sensor and a 1.5 T clinical scanner. We find that the first sign of fluid overload is an expanded muscle extracellular fluid (ECF) space, a finding undetectable at this stage on physical exam. A decrease in muscle ECF upon fluid removal was similarly detectable with the bedside sensor. Bioimpedance results generally perform worse than MRI and comparably to the bedside NMR sensor. These findings suggest that bedside NMR measurements may be an important method to identify fluid overload early in ESRD patients and potentially other patient populations as well."
MIT,"Circular, StrainedZymogen",Case number: #21110J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/circular-strained-zymogen,"The endogenous production of enzymes as zymogens provides a means to control catalytic activities. Here, we describe the heterologous production of ribonuclease 1 (RNase 1), which is the most prevalent secretory ribonuclease in humans, as a zymogen. In folded RNase 1, the N and C termini flank the enzymic active site. By using intein‐mediated cis‐splicing, we created circular proteins in which access to the active site of RNase 1 is obstructed by an amino‐acid sequence that is recognized by the HIV‐1 protease. Installing a sequence that does not perturb the RNase 1 fold led to only modest inactivation. In contrast, the ancillary truncation of residues from each terminus led to a substantial decrease in the catalytic activity of the zymogen with the maintenance of thermostability. For optimized zymogens, activation by HIV‐1 protease led to a > 104‐fold increase in ribonucleolytic activity at a rate comparable to that for the cleavage of endogenous viral substrates. Molecular modeling indicated that these zymogens are inactivated by conformational distortion in addition to substrate occlusion. Because protease levels are elevated in many disease states and ribonucleolytic activity can be cytotoxic, RNase 1 zymogens have potential as generalizable prodrugs."

Single-cell droplet systems used for analyzing soluble protein function enable rapid and accurate identification of potential drug targets to create more effective treatments for patients.\n\nTechnology: This method utilizes a single-cell platform wherein the cells of interest are physically separated from the other cells in a reaction vessel, such as a multi-well plate, microchip, microfluidic chip, or Nanopen. These cells present a cell surface protein and are genetically engineered to be encoded with a foreign test protein, such as an antibody, antigen, or reporter molecule. Depending on the purpose of the screening conducted, cells will secrete the foreign test protein and express the reporter molecule if the test protein activates the cell surface protein. Another screening method consists of contacting a single isolated cell with a test-reagent comprised of the reporter molecule. If the reporter molecule successfully gains entry to the cell by binding to the cell surface protein, cells will secrete the foreign test protein and express the reporter molecule. Through genetic modification, the presence and level of expression of the reporter molecule indicates the molecular state of the cell. In this way, an antibody’s ability to neutralize, prevent, or reduce viral infection can be rapidly analyzed in a single cell format.

Moreover, existing methods such as cell-based assays are infrequently readily compatible with the direct selection of functional protein variants that are crucial to many important drug classes, such as antibodies. In addition, alternative approaches for functional protein analysis often require multi-cell droplet compartmentalization along with the sorting of a sensor cell and protein-secreting cell. These dual cell approaches within a single droplet generally have a much lower throughput and present higher technical complexity. In contrast, this novel approach allows for the recovery of the protein-secreting cell via a genetically engineered selection marker associated with the active antibody, enabling the selection of cells that show the desired activity.\n\nAdvantages: The methods allow for the functional screening of high-volume soluble protein libraries in a rapid and cost-effective manner.. By sorting single cells rather than droplets, these methods are compatible with a broader range of cellular equipment.. The methods enable the recovery of the polypeptide secreting cell linked with a selection marker associated with the activity of the antibody, thereby allowing for easy selection of cells that show desired activity..

The binding mechanism-antigen compositions can be used to induce an immune response when administering the antigen alone has been found ineffectual.. This composition achieves FDC targeting without the need for potent protein deposition on the pathogen, while still leading to significantly improved immune responses compared to non-follicle targeted counterparts."
MIT,Power Line Communication for Low-Bandwidth Control andSensing,Case number: #23114,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/power-line-communication-low-bandwidth-control-and,"Power line communication (PLC) creates new opportunities for load management within buildings or facilities, especially for control applications that require low data rates. Such communication can be applied to enable simple Internet of Things functionality such as load balancing of a household or facility via interdevice communication of power demand. This technology can also open up ancillary communication channels for use between different systems or parties working in the same facility.\n\nTechnology: Spreading a signal impulse over a range of frequencies reduces the peak amplitude at any given frequency, reducing the generation of stray electromagnetic signals for a given signal power and decreasing the chance of the signal being highly attenuated by unpredictable frequency absorptions that may arise in the system. This technology constitutes a strategy for sending and receiving such frequency-spread signals as “chirps,” pulses of signal that either rise in frequency over their duration (“up chirps”) or fall (“down chirps”). These pulses are relatively easy to detect through the noise of the system and do not require either especially complex receiver circuitry or synchronization between transmitters and receivers. Sequences of up and down pulses can serve as a robust and versatile means for entities on a local grid to communicate information amongst one another.\n\nProblem Addressed: Power lines were not designed with communication applications in mind, but there has long been interest in exploiting power lines as convenient signal paths for low data requirement purposes such as simple messages, remote monitoring, and control of equipment. Early attempts at such usage date back to the 1920s. Historically, such efforts have suffered from attenuation of signals over the lines, unpredictable load-based changes to the signal transmission properties of the system, and regulatory constraints concerned with the emission of high strength signals from power lines. PLC systems that are both reliable and unobtrusive have thus remained elusive. By utilizing “chirps,” this signal transmission method enables PLC systems over local networks that are robust and compliant with regulations.\n\nAdvantages: Reliable PLC building communication. High tolerance for system noise and changes to impedance"
MIT,Brain-Computer Interface for User's Visual FocusDetection,Case number: #20246,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/brain-computer-interface-users-visual-focus-detection,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are interface systems that establish a connection between the signals in our brain and external devices. These systems could one day eliminate the need for traditional inputs such as keyboards or mice, and instead rely solely on brain activity to send commands that can be understood by computers. This invention presents a method for visual attention detection by capturing high-frequency (>40 Hz) brain signals generated in the visual cortex without causing any perceptible changes to the image. This technology can be used to assist individuals with motor disabilities, enhance user interaction with virtual reality, or analyze cognitive behaviors for market research.\n\nTechnology: A stimulus generator is used to introduce flickers in different parts of the virtual image space at different frequencies, all above the flicker fusion rate. An EEG sensor is then used to pick up brain waves, and to extract the SSVEP signal – which corresponds to the region of the image the user is attending to. Advanced signal processing and flicker manipulation enables the higher resolution SSVEP mapping to different parts of the image space. The image can either be virtual, such as a game or VR, or an augmented view of real images, as in augmented reality.\n\nProblem Addressed: This invention measures steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) generated at the visual cortex using electroencephalography (EEG) equipment to determine regions of an image space that a user’s visual attention is directed at. Current brain signal capture methods rely on overlaying basic shapes within the virtual space or displaying various flickering stimuli at low frequencies. However, these methods often result in perceptible changes to the visual display, which can hinder the overall user experience. Furthermore, obscured visual displays can cause visual fatigue and have the potential to trigger photo-epileptic induced seizures. The present technology addresses these limitations by implementing a high-frequency stimulus that flickers at a fast enough rate to go undetected by the used.\n\nAdvantages: Our Team.

MIT,Energy Harvesting from Temperature Fluctuations using High Thermal EffusivityMaterials,Case number: #20329,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/energy-harvesting-temperature-fluctuations-using-high,"Devices composed of materials that exhibit ultra-high thermal effusivity can harvest energy from ambient temperature fluctuations to generate power. This technology serves as a clean energy source capable of harvesting renewable energy from the environment, thereby helping to reduce overreliance on fossil fuels and other harmful pollutants.\n\nTechnology: Transient energy harvesting devices, also known as thermal resonators, have been developed as a significant improvement over prior art. These devices consist of two thermal components separated by an energy conversion device. By employing thermal diodes as thermal components and either a heat engine or thermoelectric as the energy conversion device, this technology achieves enhanced efficiency. With the thermal components exposed to ambient temperature fluctuations, the energy conversion device uses the temperature difference between the two thermal components to harvest energy. The thermal components can be tuned to perform optimally at a specific target frequency of temperature oscillations, eliminating the dependence on high-frequency conditions. The thermal resonators have monitors that communicate and process data from the environment and thermal components to achieve tuning. This advancement allows the devices to utilize a vast range and variety of ambient temperature fluctuations. Additionally, the integration of materials with ultra-high thermal effusivities and the ability to fine-tune the thermal components optimizes power generation. The adaptability and tunability of this technology make it easily integrated into existing structures such as buildings, cars, or benches, making thermal resonators a promising next step for clean power generation.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current thermal energy harvesting methods can be classified into two categories: static or transient, each of which present notable drawbacks. Static energy harvesting, exemplified by solar energy, makes use of persistent renewable sources. However, the high conductivity of the materials used in static devices decreases the efficiency of energy conversion. Meanwhile, transient energy harvesting uses temperature fluctuations to convert energy. Harvesting energy using high-frequency temperature variations is considerably more efficient, but these conditions are less persistent in the environment. This technology proposes novel methods for optimizing power generation by leveraging thermal effusivity to address the limitations of existing approaches.\n\nAdvantages: More efficient and clean energy source.. Helps to reduce over-reliance on fossil fuels.. Overcomes a significant obstacle in transient energy harvesting: the scarceness of high-frequency temperature oscillations in the environment.. Thermal resonators can be conveniently placed on preexisting objects (buildings, cars, benches, etc.).. Tuning capabilities allow for energy harvesting at specific target frequencies of temperature oscillations."
MIT,"Multi-Targeted, Tunable, Sustained Delivery of Drugs and Other Payloads to Charged AvascularTissues",Case number: #21303,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/multi-targeted-tunable-sustained-delivery-drugs-and,"This technology presents treatment options for tissue-based diseases and disorders resistant to conventional methods due to their location within the body. The compositions leverage the tissue’s naturally occurring negative charge by pairing therapeutics with positively charged carriers for effective, targeted delivery.\n\nTechnology: This technology can deliver the desired treatment molecule to charged avascular or partially vascularized tissue in a variety of ways, including but not limited to locally administered injection, pill, or powder. The treatment molecule (typically a protein, nucleic acid, or antibody) is connected, either directly or with the help of a linker molecule, to the carrier molecule. Carriers can be either synthetic or natural proteins with various net charges and surface charge distributions. However, optimal carriers will vary depending on the target tissue and therapeutic goal.\n\nProblem Addressed: Traditionally, pharmacological therapeutics are distributed throughout the body via blood in the vascular system. However, certain areas of the body like cartilage or intervertebral discs, may consist of solely avascular or partially vascularized tissue. This absence of blood vessels poses challenges in delivering drugs and other molecules/particles into the tissue, especially to the cells, in a sustained manner. As a result, conditions like osteoarthritis, intervertebral disc degeneration, and musculoskeletal diseases become incredibly difficult to treat.\n\nAdvantages: The use of positively charged carriers improves drug penetration and retention in cartilage.. This method can be employed to decrease tumor burden, cancer cell quantity, or increase immune activity.. These carriers can deliver both small molecule drugs and large biologics to cartilage."
MIT,Distributed Training and Management of Al Powered Robots using Teleoperation via VirtualSpaces,Case number: #20397,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/distributed-training-and-management-al-powered-robots,"This method can be used to more quickly and reliably train AI to operate manufacturing robots. AI trained with this method requires less human time and oversight than learning from demonstration (LFD) methods and a greater success rate than AI self-supervised learning (SL) methods. This method may be applied to any manufacturing setting which employs robots for part or all of the assembly process, including automobile, electronic, and aerospace manufacturing.\n\nTechnology: The training method proposed by the invention has two primary components. The first is a virtual “waiting room” where human operators can oversee a collection of robots and select one to manipulate. The second component is a partial algorithm for incorporating human input into the robot’s self-correction algorithm. The human operator and robot AI take on a “master-apprentice” dynamic, where the robot attempts to perform a task. If it fails a specified number of times or is not confident in the results the human operator is signaled. They can then take control of the robot to perform the task. The AI will learn from the way the operator performed the task and be able to replicate the effort unaided in the future. Thus, a single operator can be responsible for multiple robots by watching the “waiting room” and responding when an individual robot needs help with a task.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current algorithms and methods for training manufacturing AIs require a prolonged period of trial and error and may also take inordinate amounts of human time demonstrating successful and unsuccessful tasks until the robot can reliably perform the desired task. This method allows for more efficient training, by integrating AI self-feedback with human demonstrations when necessary. This results in higher task completion rates when compared to robots trained with SL methods and less human intervention when compared to robots trained with LFD methods. Additionally, a single human operator can use this method to train more AIs at the same time when compared to other available methods.\n\nAdvantages: Seamless incorporation of human feedback in manufacturing robot algorithms. More efficient than other methods of AI training. Higher task completion rates. Less human intervention in the training process"
MIT,Direct-Write Freeform ColloidalAssembly,Case number: #20202,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/direct-write-freeform-colloidal-assembly,"This technology combines colloidal self-assembly with direct-write 3D printing, offering a novel approach to additive manufacturing. It enables the creation of innovative materials with distinct mechanical, optical, and chemical properties influenced by the particles' geometry, composition, and arrangement. This specialized additive manufacturing process has applications in industries like medicine and product design. Its primary focus lies in the development and utilization of new materials such as composites, electronic and photonic materials, and innovative devices.\n\nTechnology: This technology involves a novel integration of colloids with direct-write 3D printing, allowing for the precise creation of freeform structures using suspended colloidal solid particles that remain after the liquid has evaporated. The technology consists of a stage component, mechanism for dispensing, and controller system. As colloidal particles are suspended from the dispenser onto the stage, the controller determines and sets specific relative distances and orientations between the dispenser and the stage. The precision of the controller allows the system to create the desired configurations and maintain optimal building conditions. This is achieved via sensors, which communicate with the controller to ensure that the rate of colloidal particle suspension is equal to the rate of growth of the colloidal solid. The technology also includes an evaporation system which facilitates optimal evaporation of the liquid from the dispensed colloid with an improved temperature control system. Together, the stage, dispenser, controller, and sophisticated evaporation system allow for the fabrication of stable, crack-free freeform structures of specific configuration, geometry, composition, and arrangement.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current approaches to self-assembly of ordered solid particles are constrained by limitations in shape and geometry, while preexisting direct-write 3D printing methods similarly struggle to achieve sufficient particle ordering. Furthermore, current methods yield particles that are too large for effective ordering and can only produce conical and tower structures, lacking the ability to create freeform structures. Other challenges in the fabrication of freeform colloidal crystal structures include complications associated with particle evaporation processes, the inability to sustain stable crystal growth, and the occurrence of structural cracks. Moreover, pertaining to evaporation concerns, discrepancies between the rate of evaporation and the rate of dispensing prevent stable crystal growth and limit the height of the fabricated structure. This technology overcomes these limitations by combining aspects of direct-write 3D printing with evaporative colloidal assembly. When used together, this process allows for the previously impossible fabrication of structures with specific configurations, geometry, and compositions.\n\nAdvantages: Can produce novel materials and devices composed of colloidal solids with unique mechanical, optical, and chemical properties.. Makes possible the fabrication of freeform structures of specific configuration, geometry, composition, and arrangement.. Fabricated freeform structures are stable and crack-free."
MIT,Purification of Substances Using CO2 Sub-and Super-Critical FluidChromatography,Case number: #19742,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/purification-substances-using-co2-sub-and-super,"This technology is an improved method of purifying substances from naturally derived products using sub- and super-critical CO2 (sCO2) fluid chromatography. It has applications in healthcare and medicine, specifically in the purification and isolation of cannabis-derived compounds. Unlike previous methods of chromatography, this technique does not employ co-solvents in the mobile phase of purification and instead uses either sub-or super-critical forms of liquid CO2. This reduces the time and cost spent purifying the product and the risk of denaturation or exposure to toxic co-solvents, leading to pure products that are suitable for use as human pharmaceuticals. With the current growing interest in cannabis products, this method proposes a cost-efficient manner of safely deriving purified cannabis compounds through supercritical fluid chromatography.\n\nTechnology: Fluid chromatography occurs in two phases, a stationary phase, and a mobile phase. This technology is applicable to the mobile phase in which a mixture of compounds is applied to a chromatographic column. Each of the substances passing through the column separate from the mixture at varying points in time. This separation allows for the collection of the desired compounds and disposal of unwanted compounds. When applying this technique to pharmaceuticals for human consumption, separating and disposing unwanted compounds is essential as these could be toxic. This invention aims to eliminate the need for toxic co-solvents by removing them while deriving natural products from cannabis. This technology proposes a method of supercritical fluid chromatography employing sub- or super-critical sCO2. This invention proposes the use of sCO2 in the mobile phase of chromatography instead of the typical polar co-solvents that could be toxic for human consumption. Given the known non-polarity of cannabis compounds, a polar solvent is typically employed to increase the viscosity of the mixture. This invention proposes utilizing sCO2 at altered temperatures and pressures eliminating the need for toxic, polar co-solvents (e.g., methanol and ethanol) and for extra purification steps to remove these co-solvents. This technology will reduce the time, risk, and cost associated with obtaining cannabis-derived compounds for pharmaceutical products.\n\nProblem Addressed: This technology eliminates the use of potentially toxic polar co-solvents, such as methanol and ethanol, in the mobile phase of fluid chromatography.\n\nAdvantages: Reduces consumer cost and availability for use as pharmaceuticals.. Reduces risk of product toxicity by eliminating processes that include contaminants that would be harmful for human health.. Reduces cost and time commitment necessary for isolating cannabis compounds.. Expands upon previous knowledge of the ability of sCO2 to replace liquid polar co-solvents in the mobile phase of fluid chromatography."
MIT,Tunable Interactions for Implementing Two-Qubit Gates and Suppressing Spurious Couplings Via Off-Resonantly Driven Coupler Modes in a SuperconductingChip,Case number: #23538J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/tunable-interactions-implementing-two-qubit-gates-and,"Quantum computing is poised to change the way complex computational problems are solved. This invention contains innovative findings regarding qubit technology, the building blocks of quantum computing that may be applied to new quantum system architecture. This system constitutes a platform for implementing high-fidelity operations in large arrays of qubits.\n\nTechnology: This invention consists of a novel method to enhance or suppress multiqubit interactions by applying off-resonant microwave drives to coupler modes that connect the qubits. Enclosed methods exploit the yet unreported phenomenon that in the presence of an off-resonant microwave drive on a coupler node, the “ZZ” interaction strength between two qubits can be made arbitrarily large at particular drive frequencies. Additionally, several poles in the ZZ interaction strength appear in relatively narrow frequency bands which may be engineered to not overlap with the resonant transitions of the proposed two-qubit + coupler system. This allows for large ZZ interaction rates that are stable in drive power and frequency, useful for implementing a controlled-Z or CZ gate.\n\nProblem Addressed: This technology offers hardware-efficient methods to address qubits for high-fidelity gates while also being able to easily decouple systems when idling. Compared to existing coupler-mediated gates, this technology does not require fast-flux lines to be installed on a chip, a process which can be inconvenient for scaling a system to accommodate many qubits. Qubits can thus be accommodated in a relatively large frequency band, alleviating issues related to frequency crowding and allowing qubit operation at a more optimal frequency.\n\nAdvantages: Reduces frequency crowding and spurious interactions between qubits. Substantial gains in gate fidelities. Suppresses propagation of correlated errors"
MIT,DysferlinopathyCompounds,Case number: #22496,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/dysferlinopathy-compounds,"The objective of this technology is to treat dysferlinopathy, a group of rare muscular diseases including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2b and Miyoshi myopathy. This technology is of interest to companies in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries.\n\nTechnology: The technology consists of two compounds that have been determined to have potential in future treatments of dysferlinopathy. One of these compounds is Corr-2b, a compound classified as a cystic fibrosis corrector. In in vitro human dysferlinopathy cell-based assays, Corr-2b was found to help restore localization of mutant dysferlin protein to the correct cellular location at the plasma membrane. The other compound, phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), was subsequently found to also be effective in restoring membrane localization to many known dysferlin mutants in vitro. In experiments in mice, 4-PBA was found to dramatically rescue membrane resealing following injury in DYSF-deficient cells. 4-PBA can act as a chemical chaperone to help some proteins fold properly, which may explain its ability to restore proper cellular localization of mutant dysferlin to help repair membrane damage.\n\nProblem Addressed: Dysferlinopathy is caused by a mutation in the DYSF gene that results in a deficiency of the protein dysferlin, which repairs skeletal muscle membrane damage. Dysferlinopathy is characterized by gradually progressing muscle weakness and atrophy (wasting). These diseases significantly impact mobility, as patients usually lose the ability to walk unassisted between the ages of 40 and 45. Given that there is currently no cure or treatment specifically for dysferlinopathy, there is an urgent unmet need for the development of treatments. This technology describes active compounds that show promise for use in future treatments for dysferlinopath\n\nAdvantages: Any treatment for dysferlinopathy derived from these compounds would likely be the first of its kind, as there is currently no dysferlinopathy-specific treatment.. In vitro Corr-2b, particularly 4-PBA, shows the ability to restore proper cellular localization to DYSF mutants.. 4-PBA is effective in in vivo mouse models and has a long record of safety in humans.. Treatments developed for dysferlinopathy would fall under the category of orphan drugs, providing the developing company the associated benefits.. Potential exists for other applications outside of dysferlinopathy, including treating muscle injuries, treating and preventing muscle loss, and promoting muscle growth."
MIT,Single Cell Super-ResolutionProteomics,Case number: #24088,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/single-cell-super-resolution-proteomics,"Patch2MAP uses super-resolution microscopy to label and image subcellular structures of neurons and the associated protein distributions. This method characterizes cells by their electrical activity while preserving cellular integrity, allowing for novel investigations into the fine structure and protein content of brain cells. This method opens new avenues to investigate human health and disease by combining molecular, structural, and functional approaches\n\nTechnology: Patch2MAP analysis can be conducted on any brain tissue sample with viable neuronal tissue. The method involves conducting the patch-clamp procedure on one or more of the neurons to record their individual electrical activity. Next, the patch-clamped neurons are filled with a dye to identify and highlight morphological features. The eMAP protocol was modified to achieve super-resolution proteomic imaging of the filled cells. This alteration allows for the recovery of the dye’s intracellular distribution. The tissue is then treated with anywhere from 2-30 antibodies which target desired proteins and expanded to visualize the structure.\n\nProblem Addressed: This technology allows for the full structural labeling of individual neurons for subsequent protein analysis. Current methods for analyzing the structure and function of sub-cellular processes use super-resolution microscopy. However, these approaches require inducing cells to express a foreign protein as a label for identification. This is typically done through genetic modification or viral transduction. In species or cells where, genetic medication is not feasible (most importantly the human brain), current state of the art techniques is unable to visualize proteins and assign them to the appropriate cell types and their subcellular compartments.\n\nAdvantages: Capable of full morphological labeling of individual neurons from any species or cell type. Allows for morphological reconstruction of fine processes including dendritic spines and axons. Enables multiple rounds of de-staining and re-staining the tissue without loss of structural integrity for investigation of many proteins"
MIT,Targeting Dendritic Cell Lectins with Glycosylated Particles Containing TLR Ligands Facilitates Efficient ImmuneResponses,Case number: #24570J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/targeting-dendritic-cell-lectins-glycosylated,"This vaccine utilizes virus-like particles (VLPs) to selectively target and activate antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to stimulate antigen-specific immunity. This treatment is administered to subjects via injection and can be used to treat or prevent diseases such as cancer.\n\nTechnology: This vaccine leverages DCs, a kind of APC, as the primary initiators of anti-tumor immune responses due to their ability to activate tumor antigen-specific T-cells. Because T-cells cannot independently identify invading pathogens, cancer vaccines rely on priming T-cells to recognize and kill tumor antigens. The priming process utilizes the DCs to initiate and modulate the body’s immune response.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current approaches to cancer vaccinations are often limited by a lack of rapid production capability due to complex engineering parameters. Furthermore, peptide antigens used in vaccines often fail to induce a sufficient immune response without additional substances to promote immunogenicity. Consequently, these methods are most useful as laboratory screening tools and lack applicability as effective treatment options. This development overcomes these limitations by utilizing functionalized virus-like particles (VLPs) as a delivery mechanism for peptide antigens and by harnessing lectins displayed on the surface of the dendritic cells (DCs) to direct and induce immunity within the subject. Research shows that DC lectin targeting successfully induces cell-mediated immune responses involving antigen-specific T cell priming.\n\nAdvantages: VLPs efficiently drive proliferation of antigen specific T-cells against an endogenous tumor antigen.. VLPs typically deliver antigens more effectively than the same antigen would when presented alone.. This composition is compatible with many antigens including those derived from a virus, bacteria, parasite, allergen, or tumor.. VLPs can display two or more antigens, which can direct either the same or different immune responses in a subject.. VLPs are highly adaptable, can act as hosts to other molecular interactions, and possess high biocompatibility with other components of the treatment."
MIT,High-Throughput Extrusion-Based AdditiveManufacturing,Case number: #18202,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/high-throughput-extrusion-based-additive,"The focus of this technology is to improve additive manufacturing processes, such as 3D printing, by incorporating a pre-heater, upgraded extruder designs, and alternative filament forms. Additive manufacturing plays an important role in many industries including medicine, product design, cinematography, and aerospace.\n\nTechnology: The proposed technology consists of adding a pre-heater component and using both alternative forms of filament and upgraded designs of the extruder. The function of the pre-heater is to raise the temperature of the filament received from the extruder to a desired preheated temperature before it enters the liquefier. The pre-heater contains a transmitter capable of transmitting radiation or current that ensures the filament is uniformly heated. The extruder can be upgraded to contain a feature that improves filament engagement. The inside of the extruder contains a rotatable feed nut that meets the filament, producing a force capable of effectively driving the filament through the extruder. A device known as a die initially shapes the filament so that its form becomes complementary with the inside of the extruder. Thus, the filament becomes threaded and almost interacts with the extruder as two gears would. The die or the surface of the filament may be heated to aid this process. Parameters such as force applied to the feed nut of the extruder, power supplied to the pre-heater, and power supplied to the liquefier can be adjusted by use of a controller to produce desired preheat and melt temperatures as well as desired feed rates of the filament. Force and temperature measurements taken along the path of the filament through the printer are used to determine the extent of the adjustments to the parameters. Furthermore, the filament can be comprised of two different materials with varying conductivities so that upon melting the more conductive material remains less viscous, which may help advancement through the extruder.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current three-dimensional printing devices have multiple design limitations that impede high throughput, defined as the amount of material passing through the printer. These devices contain an extruder where material in the form of filament is put under pressure. Traditional extruder designs place insufficient pressure on the filament due to inadequate filament engagement area, hindering high throughput.  Furthermore, poor heat exchange between the filament and the liquefier requires extrusion to occur at lower speeds. If extrusion speed is increased, the filament does not fully melt, and solid fragments cause jams at the nozzle of the printer. Additionally, gantry designs, which refer to the frame structures that help determine printing location by supporting movement of the extruder-liquefier complex, cannot withstand high speed and acceleration. Attempts to increase gantry speed and acceleration require larger components, leading to increased mass and inertia, limiting overall performance. Moreover, the high pressure necessary for extrusion poses a challenge as the filament often has difficulty withstanding this pressure. Technology capable of overcoming these barriers by means of improved extruder designs and heating techniques is necessary to achieve higher throughput.\n\nAdvantages: Higher throughput 3D printing.. Reduces jamming because uniform heating is ensured.. Feedback mechanism using real-time temperature and force measurements optimizes conditions for high-throughput printing."
MIT,Cyclooctynes for ClickChemistry,Case number: #23210,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/cyclooctynes-click-chemistry,"“Click chemistry” describes a set of selective reactions that reliably join small units of molecules to create more complex molecules. Strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloadditions (SPAACs) are a subset of click chemistry reactions that are biorthogonal, meaning they do not harm living systems, making SPAACs an invaluable tool for observing biological systems at the molecular level.\n\nTechnology: Using an integrated computational and experimental process, the inventors have developed a novel class of SPAAC reagents that has both increased bond strain, and increased transition state stability. Compared to current state of the art SPAAC reagents, this technology has significantly improved reaction kinetics, without compromising stability. Additionally, the reagents can be synthesized in a simple, three-step synthesis, making it a promising novel class of reagents for pharmaceutical, biological research, and materials chemistry applications.\n\nProblem Addressed: This technology accelerates the rate of SPAACs and other 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions. Two approaches have been used to improve SPAAC reagent reaction kinetics without compromising selectivity and stability: increasing bond strain (pre-distortion) and fine-tuning transition state stabilization, however, prior to this invention, attempts suffered from tradeoffs, and multistep syntheses. This three-step synthesis produces a novel class of stable, highly selective, fast-reacting cyclooctynes useful for click chemistry applicable to the fields of chemical biology, polymer chemistry, and materials chemistry.\n\nAdvantages: Allows for alternative reagents to be used in the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction with a faster rate of reaction than any other options commercially available for cycloadditions.. Provides a systematic process for the generation of stable, efficient, and highly selective click chemistry reagents.. High selectivity - azides and alkynes rarely react with other cellular components so SPAAC can occur inside complex biological systems.. Biocompatibility - the cycloaddition reaction conditions do not harm living cells or organisms.. Fast reaction kinetics - using strained alkynes gives fast reaction rates at low concentrations needed for living systems.. Offers a wide variety of applications, such as in drug discovery, novel peptide therapeutic development, radioactive imaging, and polymeric materials augmentation."
MIT,Synthetic Mucin Glycans as AntifungalAgents,Case number: #24073J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/synthetic-mucin-glycans-antifungal-agents,"This technology utilizes mucus’ natural ability to repress the virulence of fungal infections such as those caused by Candida albicans, repair and maintain the bodies’ natural microbiome, and support its crucial mucus barrier.\n\nTechnology: To determine how mucin glycans regulate C. albicans physiology, researchers performed RNA sequencing on cells grown in various kinds of mucus. Through this experiment, it was determined that all mucins participated in the downregulation of genes associated with fungal virulence. This novel treatment method, derived from these research findings, comprises a method of contacting the fungus with a mucin glycan and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. This modulates the virulence associated genes, reduces fungus surface adhesion, and inhibits fungus’ morphological transition into virulent cells. Depending on the kind of infection, administration can be carried out in several manners including injection, ingestion, or inhalation.\n\nProblem Addressed: Mucus forms a protective barrier over bodily cavities that contact the external environment. C. albicans is a fungal pathogen that harmlessly colonizes the body’s mucosal linings, particularly around the mouth, gastrointestinal system, and female genital tract. Alternations to the mucus barrier and changes in the microbiome can lead to C. albicans overgrowth and infection, which can be fatal. C. albicans is unique in that it can switch between a yeast form and a hyphal, or mold form, with the latter being much more virulent and damaging.\n\nAdvantages: Mucin glycans can weaken and degrade various cross-kingdom pathogens.. Mucins can be synthetic or naturally occurring.. This technology avoids the potential development of resistance to treatment.. This composition lacks the toxicity of other antifungal or antibacterial treatments."
MIT,Synthesis of Covalent Protein Dimers that can Inhibit MYC-DrivenTranscription,Case number: #23305WJ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/synthesis-covalent-protein-dimers-can-inhibit-myc,"This technology utilizes automated flow protein synthesis to generate analogs of transcription factors. These synthetic molecules serve as a cancer treatment method by inhibiting transcription driven cancer cell proliferation.\n\nTechnology: This technology provides a method for creating homologous or heterologous protein molecules wherein both molecules are at least 85% similar with either MYC, MAX, or Omomyc. These are produced via automated flow synthesis which uses tubes and channels to create a continual chemical reaction stream over a batch in a single reaction vessel. First, reagents are merged through flow pumps before activating heating loops. Next, the reagents are spread over a peptidyl resin which will support the protein structure synthesis. After, the two small molecules are connected via a linker to create the molecular structure, allowing the supportive resins to be cleaved from the final molecule.\n\nProblem Addressed: Transcription factors are proteins responsible for “turning on” and “off” certain genes which produce specific proteins. MYC is a transcription factor protein that can either bind with MAX, another transcription factor protein, to form heterologous molecules (MYC/MAX), or bind with itself to form homologous molecules (MAX/MAX). These molecules then compete for a shared DNA target site. MYC dysregulation and overexpression are observed in more than fifty percent of human cancers.\n\nAdvantages: Molecules are intrinsically able to penetrate and be internalized by cells.. Method can rapidly produce engineered synthetic protein complexes.. Compositions can be used to treat various cancers and other immune diseases including, but not limited to myasthenia gravis, psoriasis, pemphigus vulgaris, and atherosclerosis."

The inventors have demonstrated the significance of lung microbiota in differentiating and activating tumor-associated T cells within the lung. As a result, this method offers a means to target the lung microbiota and related immune pathways for therapeutic applications in lung cancer patients. The method includes:\n\nProblem Addressed: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide in both men and women. Recent scientific advancements have introduced various forms of targeted lung cancer therapy; however, survival rates continue to be relatively low. Throughout their treatment, many lung cancer patients contract pulmonary infections, which have been proven to adversely affect the survival rates of lung cancer patients. Healthy lung immune cells typically maintain a state of homeostasis, ensuring immune cell surveillance against invading pathogens. However, the presence of a tumor within the lungs can disrupt this bacterial balance, leading to an increase in local bacterial burden. Consequently, this imbalance elevates the rate of lung inflammation and tumor proliferation. This phenomenon is primarily driven by the activation of resident lung T-cells, which produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that, in turn, stimulate neutrophil expression and tumor cell proliferation.

MIT,Methods for Support Removal in Stereolithographic AdditiveManufacturing,Case number: #20638,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/methods-support-removal-stereolithographic-additive,"The technology presented improves additive manufacturing processes by introducing optimized techniques for removing support structures during the fabrication of 3D objects. Additive manufacturing finds applications in various industries, including medicine, product design, aerospace, and cinematography.\n\nTechnology: Each of the removal methods proposed in this technology includes modulating the properties at the interfaces between the support structures and 3D objects. In one embodiment of the technology, the intensity of light can be varied between the two, causing strength discrepancies and allowing for separation. Another approach involves creating a notch—a geometric shape in material—that concentrates the separation to a specific location. Using two different materials for the support structures and 3D objects is another effective method for altering mechanical properties at the interface. For example, one material might partially cure, hardening at a different light wavelength than the other. Alternatively, one material may be more resistant to swelling, so that upon immersion into solvent, the differences in swelling initiates separation. In essence, these methods focus on altering mechanical properties at the interface to allow for optimized separation of support structures and 3D objects. Thus, this technology guarantees the manufacture of 3D objects with desired functionality while upholding high surface quality.\n\nProblem Addressed: Stereolithographic additive manufacturing involves the fabrication of 3D structures, which often require support during the building process. Current methods of removing support structures from 3D objects after completion of printing are suboptimal, requiring labor- and time-intensive manual removal. The manual removal can leave residual stubs that must be polished or sanded down. Moreover, since both support and 3D structures are often made of the same material, automated removal methods like dissolution are prevented. This new technology addresses these limitations by providing efficient methods for the removal of support structures.\n\nAdvantages: Efficient removal of support structures significantly reduces if not eliminates manual labor.. Part functionality and high surface quality of parts is preserved.. Removed need for polishing and sanding.. The manufacturing of 3D objects is more time efficient."
MIT,RNA-Loaded Lipid Nanoparticle(LNP),Case number: #24973H,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/rna-loaded-lipid-nanoparticle-lnp,"This technology provides pharmaceutical compositions for self-replicating RNA (repRNA) vaccines with an inhibitory nucleic acid, delivered through lipid nanoparticles for enhanced immunity in the patient. Vaccines may be designed to combat any number of infections including HIV, COVID-19, and certain cancers.\n\nTechnology: Through vaccines or similar pharmaceutical compositions, this technology delivers repRNA (encoded with an antigen gene of interest) and inhibitory nucleic acid to immune cells by means of small particles composed of lipids. Upon administration to the subject, the nucleic acid binds to a segment of Ifnar1 to prevent its expression. This allows immune cells to produce the encoded antigen and elicit a robust antibody response.\n\nProblem Addressed: Unlike traditional vaccines, RNA vaccines are encoded with mRNA (genetic sequences for specific antigens), allowing the immune system to recognize and combat pathogens without introducing any infectious elements into the system. Advancements in this technology have led to the use of repRNA, which encodes antigen genes and the genes for RNA replication, eliciting a more robust and long-lasting immune response. This is done by altering an RNA virus so that the viral genes are replaced with the antigen gene of interest. However, this structure can trigger the immune system to suppress repRNA translation and replication. To overcome these challenges, this new composition includes key genetic information on protein synthesis in the form of inhibitory nucleic acids designed to silence Ifnar1— the gene responsible for the unwanted immune responses, permitting higher levels and more prolonged expression of the repRNA to provide lasting immunity for patients.\n\nAdvantages: repRNA vaccines are a safer and more effective method of eliciting immunity than traditional vaccines, as they remove the need for pathogen cultures and require only the target antigens gene sequence.. repRNA produces longer-lasting immunity than other vaccine alternatives"
MIT,Vibration Absorber for Powertools,Case number: #21428,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/vibration-absorber-power-tools,"This invention introduces a device capable of minimizing the vibration transfer between power tools and a user’s hand. It has numerous applications in industries that require repetitive use of vibrating machinery, including construction, woodworking, and automotive repair.\n\nTechnology: The vibration absorber is comprised of an adjustable adaptor with a core of closed cell liquid filled foams (CCLFF). The CCLFF includes a material containing a viscoelastic polymer (e.g., UV cured acrylate) and a liquid (e.g., polyethene glycol), which can be dispersed into the polymer, with the liquid by volume ranging between 0 to 50 percent. The device additionally comprises of a tool contact surface and a connection mechanism which adheres to the adaptor to the power tool. To prevent liquid from leaking onto the user’s hand or surrounding device, a sealing layer of a viscoelastic material with 0 percent liquid may encricle the CCLFF, enhancing the adhesion of durable, rubber-like materials to the adaptor. To secure the tool to the adaptor, the surface of the selected section can be adhered through either friction fit or clips and interlocks.\n\nProblem Addressed: Hand-arm vibration syndrome arises due to repetitive, vibration-induced trauma, leading to sensory, vascular, and musculoskeletal issues for those affected. In the US alone, around 1.2 million workers are subject to this health hazard daily, necessitating urgent solutions from industry experts to address the problem. Several known methods like glove-based insulators face limitations due to sensory obstructions that impair the user’s grip and control of the tool. The present device addresses this health concern by incorporating a viscoelastic material with a base elastomer, reducing the mass and costs of current vibration dampers in the market while maintaining customizable device properties.\n\nAdvantages: Reduced costs due to streamlined casting and molding process.. More lightweight than traditional vibrational dampening materials.. Durable surface for easy cleaning and dust removal.. Moldable depression in the material allows for easy gripping."
MIT,Target for Modulating BodyMass,Case number: #21326,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/target-modulating-body-mass,"This invention utilizes a novel mechanism within the mitochondria of the cell to modulate metabolism, providing a method for treating obesity and related diseases. The discoveries may also be applied to promote weight gain.\n\nTechnology: In typical cells, cellular respiration couples with ATP production, producing energy to fuel bodily functions. This technology utilizes heme, an iron-containing compound critical to cellular metabolism, to discourage ATP production and increase thermogenesis. Heme functions as an inhibitor of the membrane transport protein MFSD7C. With low heme levels, MFSD7C facilitates transporting potential energy through the mitochondrial membrane to produce usable ATP. When a sufficient amount of heme is administered to a subject, MFSD7C dissociates from the system, producing thermogenesis, releasing excess energy as heat and increasing oxygen consumption. This enables cells to match the outputs of mitochondrial respiration to the current metabolic state and nutrient supply within the body. Using the same principles, the results may also be reversed to decrease cellular respiration and promote weight gain in subjects.\n\nProblem Addressed: Obesity is a pressing health crisis, impacting individuals of all backgrounds and acting as a significant risk factor of numerous prevalent diseases. Obesity profoundly affects the overall quality of life, thus necessitating the creation of new treatment methods.\n\nAdvantages: Expands on prior art by identifying specific membrane transport proteins as targets for drugs that promote energy dissipation through heat.. Improves cellular respiration and oxygen consumption rate which has been shown to improve various diseases, offering a holistic approach to the health concerns of those suffering from obesity rather than purely focusing on weight management."

The following filings describe how Cas7-11 can be used for RNA editing:\n\nProblem Addressed: While many DNA-targeting CRISPR tools have been developed, there is a relative lack of RNA targeting CRISPR tools. The development of such RNA tools has been hindered by several barriers, including the fact that CRISPR RNA editing protein complexes can act weakly in mammals’ cells and have off-target toxic effects. Additionally, the size of these tools prevents them from being administered in mouse models through common techniques like adeno-associated vectors (AAV). This limits the ability to use these tools in applications like single-vector homology-directed repair (HDR), CRISPR base editing, gene activation, and large gene delivery. There is therefore a demand for effective RNA editing tools.\n\nAdvantages: Efficient RNA knockdown and RNA editing capabilities. No effect on cell viability, contrary to current RNA editing tools like shRNA and Cas13 which lead to cell toxicity. Off-target effects are reversible and are less profound and harmful than those in DNA editing. Can be packaged in vectors such as AAV.. Capable of making small or large edits..

The control of electron spin provides additional degrees of freedom to modify the electric and magnetic properties of materials such as magnetic anisotropy. However, the development and integration of spintronic devices has been limited, in part, by the lack of a robust approach to electrically gate magnetism.

MIT,"Method for Preservation, Transport, and Analysis of WaterSamples",Case number: #18688,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/method-preservation-transport-and-analysis-water,"This invention lays out an approach to greatly expand access to water quality testing rapidly and at low cost. Such access would improve the safety of drinking water in developing countries and areas relying on decentralized water supplies such as wells.\n\nTechnology: The invention constitutes a revolutionary strategy for simplifying the collection and transport of water samples with kits into which water can be added that capture and fix in a solid form all materials of interest for water quality testing. The approach is analogous to that previously pioneered for the transport and storage of blood: dried blood spot testing. Rather than transporting liquid samples of water, solid material representative of the water added to it is sent from the field to be centralized laboratories, where it can be analyzed with the greatest precision and thoroughness. The kit is centered around a “tea bag” which is to be steeped in the water, dried, and mailed to a central testing facility. This “tea bag” contains an adsorbent such as cellulose, polymers, clays onto which any impurities of the water will stick and any necessary chemical agents that will ensure the stability of the contaminants during transport or render them more easily detected during analysis. Ensuring that measurements done on the kit samples are comparable to actual water samples is as simple as calibrating results to samples analyzed by more conventional methods. The kits can be sent out in envelopes with return postage and used by untrained individuals. The kits’ simplicity allows them to be sent out broadly anywhere with postal service and can therefore empower every person to exercise their right to know their drinking water is safe, no matter how small or remote their water source may be.\n\nProblem Addressed: Access to safe drinking water remains far from universal, especially in developing countries. Diarrhea alone accounts for an estimated 297,000 preventable deaths of children under the age of 5 each year according to the World Health Organization. Beyond acute illness, chronic exposure to pollutants such as heavy metals also remain widespread, with an estimated 150 million people each year exceeding the WHO’s recommended safe exposure limit for arsenic.\n\nAdvantages: More precise and thorough than field testing. Cheaper transport of water samples. Practical storage of historical samples. Simple sample preparation enables democratization of testing."

The technology has a variety of applications including knocking down RNA, performing A-I editing of RNA, trans-splicing RNA, stabilizing RNA, altering splicing of pre-mRNA, changing microRNA targets, and modulating translation. It has significant therapeutic potential, with applications in treating genetic diseases or targeting cells for oncology and can also serve as a diagnostic tool for detecting bacteria and viruses in a sample.\n\nTechnology: This technology centers around a unique family of editing enzymes called Cas7-11. Cas7-11 is a Type III-E CRISPR Cas effector composed of a fusion of four Cas7 proteins and a Cas11-like protein. The Cas7-11 protein family is experimentally predicted to act as a programmable RNase that lacks the “collateral” off-target activity of Cas13, the Cas protein currently used for RNA targeting. The following filings describe how Cas7-11 can be used for RNA editing:\n\nProblem Addressed: While many DNA-targeting CRISPR tools have been developed, there is a relative lack of RNA targeting CRISPR tools. The development of such RNA tools has been hindered by several barriers, including the fact that CRISPR RNA editing protein complexes can act weakly in mammals’ cells and have off-target toxic effects. Additionally, the size of these tools prevents them from being administered in mouse models through common techniques like adeno-associated vectors (AAV). This limits the ability to use these tools in applications like single-vector homology-directed repair (HDR), CRISPR base editing, gene activation, and large gene delivery. There is therefore a demand for effective RNA editing tools.\n\nAdvantages: Efficient RNA knockdown and RNA editing capabilities. No effect on cell viability, contrary to current RNA editing tools like shRNA and Cas13 which lead to cell toxicity. Off-target effects are reversible and are less profound and harmful than those in DNA editing. Can be packaged in vectors such as AAV.. Capable of making small or large edits..

The four different magnetization states (, , , ), of the FM/NM/FM layers give rise to four unique resistance levels, which can be read out by a simple two-terminal electric measurement. As a result, this FM/NM/FM multilayer structure can be used in a lateral, two-terminal device to store multiple magnetic bits. Moreover, the magnetic states can be manipulated by spin-orbit torques, opening the possibility for all-electrical operation."
MIT,Voltage Controlled Solid State PlasmonicDevice,Case number: #19499,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/voltage-controlled-solid-state-plasmonic-device,"Achieving precise, localized reversible control of optical material properties is challenging. Fortunately, electrochemical reactions and proton pumping in a solid-state system provide reversible electrical control of the solid-state system's optical properties. Applying a voltage to a thin solid electrolyte layer, such as GdOx, splits water into O2 and H+ (with charge conservation ensured by electron transfer at the electrodes) at the interface between the solid electrolyte and an electrode. The voltage drives the protons into the solid electrolyte, changing the solid electrolyte's refractive index. Reversing the polarity of the applied voltage drives the protons out of the solid electrolyte, reversing the refractive index change. This reversible electrical control can be used to implement interference color modulation, transmission modulation, and switchable plasmonics. Because the solid electrolyte can be less than 10 nanometers thick, this electrochemical control enables highly localized control of optical properties active plasmonic devices and reconfigurable metamaterials."

MIT,Electrochemically Tunable Affinity Separation (ETAS) of Organics fromWater,Case number: #19563,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/electrochemically-tunable-affinity-separation-etas,"Separation processes are of great importance in the chemical and environmental industries, accounting for 10-25% of the world’s energy consumption, and a third of total capital and operation costs in industrial plants. This invention demonstrates a separation technology with high energy efficiency and low environmental impact supporting downstream water sustainability and water economy.\n\nTechnology: ETAS relies on the use of a stimulus-responsive adsorbent system that has surface hydrophobicity programmable by an electrical signal. Such an adsorbent displays an electrically controlled affinity toward. neutral. organic molecules, enabling the use of exquisite electrical swing to release and capture organics cyclically. The key to achieving ETAS resides in the development of multicomponent polymeric nanostructures that simultaneously exhibit an oxidation-state dependent affinity towards neutral organics, high porosity for sufficient adsorption capacity, and high conductivity to permit electrical manipulation. The ETAS absorbent system consists of a carbon cloth (CC) that serves as a flexible and robust conductive substrate, with a conformal coating of a polyvinylferrocene/polypyrrole (PVF/PPY) composite. The binary polymer film is fabricated via simultaneous electro-polymerization of pyrrole and electrodeposition of PVF. The ferrocene moieties in PVF render redox-tunable hydrophobicity while the conjugated PPY chains establish electron transport pathways to permit electrical control. Furthermore, through redox electrode simulations and theoretical calculations of electron transfer kinetics, a generalizable material design strategy is developed to simultaneously improve the separation degree and energetic efficiency during ETAS operation.\n\nProblem Addressed: The global prevalence of contaminated water resources by organic pollutants, such as pesticides, dyes, pharmaceuticals, and endocrine disrupting compounds has raised concerns about potential deleterious effects on the environment and on human health. Electrochemically controlled processes, such as capacitive deionization are promising candidates for wastewater management and desalination. However, these processes rely on electrostatic interactions between the electrode and the target pollutant. These processes are not applicable to uncharged organic pollutants, which constitute the majority of industrial and municipal water contaminants, including dyes, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and carcinogenic aromatics. High separation efficiencies for the removal of organics from water have been achieved using conventional processes such as adsorption, distillation, and solvent extraction, as well as more recent technologies such as advanced oxidation treatment and membrane separation. However, the overall separation processes inherently associated with these methods usually involve energy-intensive steps and/or environmentally unfriendly processes. This technology incorporates exquisite electrical control into separation of. uncharged. molecules from water and has higher energy efficiencies and lower environmental costs than established methods for separating neutral organics from water.\n\nAdvantages: Separation of uncharged organic species from water. Energy efficient due to operation at room temperature and pressure. Environmentally responsible without using organic solvent and additives and does not  generate secondary pollutants. ETAS-integrated devices show modularity, portability and low-cost. Highly flexible modulation of affinity for target pollutants with high spatiotemporal resolution to achieve intricate balance between the separation degree and the energetic efficiency"

MIT,Design of Inorganic Layers for Artificial Interphases on Alkali Metals Using ReactiveGases,Case number: #20830,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/design-inorganic-layers-artificial-interphases-alkali,"This invention generates surface films on alkali metals, including lithium, to protect from self-plating and corrosion induced by organic electrolytes in rechargeable batteries. This invention offers the potential to increase the energy densities of current rechargeable batteries by preserving the function of metal electrodesand can be applicable to energy-intensive processes like the grid-scale storage of renewable energy.\n\nProblem Addressed: Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, based on a graphite anode, play a central role in energy storage technologies for portable power and consumer electronics; however, their energy densities need to be significantly increased to be viable for energy-intensive processes like grid-scale storage of renewable energy. Current lithium electrode technology is limited by several problems which reduce battery lifespan and storage capacity including: self-plating of lithium onto itself to form dendrites, aggressive volume expansion and contraction during cycling, and corrosion by organic electrolytes. Solutions to these problems are critical to achieving the higher energy-density chemistries possible with lithium-oxygen and lithium-sulfur batteries. This invention develops a methodology to overcome these limitations by coating the metal, such as lithium electrodes, in a film that still permits ionic conductivity.\n\nAdvantages: Ex situ. growth of purely ionic layers onto lithium surfaces using a simple low temperature thermochemical approach. Avoids co-inclusion of reduced electrolyte (solvent and salt) products into the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) of a lithium electrode.

MIT,Biological StateMachines,Case number: #18230,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/biological-state-machines,"Cellular state machines emulate digital circuits by integrating multiple binary inputs (e.g., chemical inducers) and producing outputs (e.g., gene expression). They have wide-ranging biotechnological applications. For example, they can be used to program and model cellular behaviors such as development and differentiation by controlling the timing and sequence of transcription factor cascades. They can be used as cellular biosensors in which the output (i.e., the DNA sequences or gene expression patterns that comprise the ""state"" of the cell) is a function of the input (i.e., the pattern of exposure to chemical inducers). Moreover, they can be implemented in biomanufacturing processes in which it would be advantageous to cycle cells through tightly regulated phases (e.g., biomass accumulation, biomolecule production, and cell lysis).\n\nTechnology: State machines are used as computing devices that integrate input signals and respond with a context-dependent output. Each output represents one possible “state” in which the machine can exist. State machines are order dependent, meaning that the sequential state depends on both the input and the current state. State machines can exist in cells, whereby synthetic gene networks drive the transition between cellular states in an input- and state-dependent manner. This E. coli-based system produces unique gene expression patterns that define the cellular “state” in response to chemical inducer inputs. Both the identity and order of inducers matter, making it possible to distinguish between ‘Input A then Input B’ and ‘Input B then Input A.’ The chemical inducers manipulate the state of the cell by driving the expression of recombinases, which invert or excise sections of DNA (e.g., promoters, terminators, and output genes) based on the orientation of recognition sites. Modulating the assembly of the targeted gene circuit components enables complex and varied states. The gene circuit assembly is modular and can be achieved in one step. In contrast to conditional gene expression methods that require constant induction (e.g., those based on transcription), this system maintains a stable memory even after inputs are withdrawn. Thus, cells need only transient induction in order to be locked into a state, allowing for the implementation of sequential inputs and the interrogation of long-term cellular history.\n\nProblem Addressed: Traditional methods for implementing conditional gene expression tend to be limited with respect to the complexity of the networks they induce. Often, the gene of interest is rendered ‘on’ or ‘off’ in response to an environmental or intrinsically regulated cue. Context-dependent gene expression regulation has been achieved, but it is often transcription-based and as such, requires chronic induction (e.g., doxycycline treatment). Traditional inducible platforms are also limited with respect to combinatorial regulation of multiple genes in a single cell. Cellular state machines are uniquely capable of implementing tightly regulated genetic cascades that are dependent on both the order and combination of inputs. This greatly increases the complexity of programmable genetic networks, permitting the modeling and optimization of sophisticated biological processes such as cellular differentiation and biomanufacturing.\n\nAdvantages: Multiplexed reporting of inputs with single output. Modular, one-step assembly of circuit. Flexible design permits multiple paths to implement the same input/output behavior. Maintains state memory after inputs are withdrawn. Can detect the order of chemical events. Can program increased number of output behaviors as compared to state-less induction platforms"
MIT,A Platform for Continuous Directed Evolution in HumanCells,Case number: #19909,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/platform-continuous-directed-evolution-human-cells,"This invention is a novel system for performing directed evolution in a human cell based system. It has wide-ranging applications in the development of protein-based therapeutics and in evolutionary biology research.\n\nTechnology: Human cells replicate slowly with low mutational burden, making it challenging to design evolutionary schemes. Additionally, accelerating overall mutation rate with chemical or genetic mutagens often results in “cheating” in which mutations arise in other compensatory pathways to allow subvert selection, rather than mutating the gene of interest (GOI). These inventors engineered a safe, robust, adenovirus system to circumvent these challenges of human cells. The inventors engineered an adenoviral polymerase (EP-Pol), which replicates only the adenoviral genome, to introduce random mutation at a rate several orders of magnitude greater than wild type adenoviral polymerase. To prevent self-mutation of EP-Pol back to a more efficient state, EP-Pol is expressed in. trans. in human HEK293 derived cells, and the wild type Pol is deleted from the adenoviral genome. The GOI is then expressed in the adenoviral genome, allowing rapid generation of mutational libraries through adenoviral replication. For a selection scheme, the inventors use the viral protease gene that is required for efficient viral production. The viral protease gene is expressed in. trans. under the control of an inducible promoter transcriptionally coupled to GOI function. When the GOI has mutations that give more target functionality, it is able to activate the expression of a protease and propagate, while those that lack the correct function are lost. The GOI is therefore repeatedly and continuously selected for new mutations that yield increased target functionality. As a proof of principle experiment, the inventors used this scheme to select for mutations in the tetracycline transactivator protein to be insensitive to doxyclycline induction, and they were able to successfully evolve this functionality in <5 viral generations. Importantly, this system could be rapidly translated to other proteins of interest, allowing evolution of novel protein therapeutics.\n\nProblem Addressed: Biomolecules can have immense potential as therapeutics and research tools. Unfortunately, rational design of proteins is nearly impossible due to the complex structures required for protein function, so scientists have long been limited to utilizing proteins that are found in nature. To surmount this difficulty, genetic engineers have recently taken inspiration from nature and developed technologies that rapidly evolve proteins to have novel functions. However, it remains challenging to develop therapeutics using protein evolution because, until now, no mammalian-optimized directed evolution systems have been created. These inventors have engineered the first broadly generalizable platform for performing directed evolution in human cells that allows rapid protein evolution in a therapeutically relevant system.\n\nAdvantages: First ever broadly generalizable directed evolution platform in living human cells. Rapidly generates large mutational library through adenoviral replication. Continuous mutation and selection scheme engineered to reduce selection subversion"
MIT,Phononic Crystals with Adiabatic Transitions for Full Acoustic Confinement in MEMESResonators,Case number: #18400,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/phononic-crystals-adiabatic-transitions-full-acoustic,"This technology has applications in:\n\nCommunications and radio frequency (RF)\nElectronic systems needing sharp and monolithically integrated filters\nSolid state high-Q MEMS resonators\nTiming and clocks\nModulating lasers for on-chip optical waveguides\nNarrow-band lasers and optical filters\n\nTechnology: The invention is a novel way of guiding elastic waves and confining mechanical vibrational energy using phononic crystals and adiabatic (slow) transitions in a completely solid-state commercial CMOS stack. This requires that phonons, quanta of sound, are completely contained within the CMOS die. The result is a 35 times improvement in the Q-factor of the phononic crystal CMOS resonant body transistors (PnC-CMOS RBTs). The invention can also be used as a phononic trap or coupled with on-chip micro- and nano-photonics to achieve on-chip opto-mechanical coupling. The invention is applicable in all operational frequencies which can be fabricated by current CMOS technologies.\n\nProblem Addressed: MEMS resonators are high-Q, narrow-band filters are used in communications and RF applications. The high-Q, narrow-band filters lead to a more selective filter and the oscillators have a lower phase noise over conventional designs. However, current designs are not fully solid-state and require post processing which cannot be fully integrated.\n\nAdvantages: 35x quality factor improvement over phononic crystal CMOS resonant body transistors. Low-phase noise oscillators eliminate the need for bulky Quartz crystals"
MIT,Crystal Structures of Human TorsinA and its DystoniaMutant,Case number: #18394,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/crystal-structures-human-torsina-and-its-dystonia,"This technology may be used as a treatment optionfor Early-Onset and other forms of Dystonia.\n\nTechnology: Early-onset, torsion dystonia (DYT1) is a genetic disease affecting an estimated 50,000 patients in the United Sates alone. It is an incurable and severely debilitating neuromuscular disease. A single glutamate deletion at position 302 or 303 of the protein TorsinA (TorsinADE302/303) is the primary cause of DYT1. TorsinA is an enzyme that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell, where it most likely functions in protein or membrane remodeling. TorsinA is activated by lamina-associated protein 1 (LAP1) and by luminal domain-like LAP1 (LULL1). The TorsinADE302/303 mutant weakens the binding of the activators LAP1/LULL1, which presumably presents the molecular basis for the disease. If binding to the activator can be restored, for examples by a small molecule, this may represent the drug needed to cure the disease. Here, a single-chain antibody fragment, or nanobody, called VHH-BS2, which specifically binds TorsinA and LULL1 has been found. Using this nanobody as a crystallization chaperone, both TorsinA-LULL1-VHH-BS2 and mutant TorsinADE302/303-LULL1-VHH-BS2 complexes were crystallized and the structures solved at very high resolution (1.4 Å). The ability to stabilize a weak interaction such as the one between mutant TorsinA and LULL1 is extremely rare and immediately suggests the possibility to provide a structural basis for rational drug design for DYT1.\n\nProblem Addressed: A single-chain antibody fragment, known as nanobody, has been developed to serve as a crystallization chaperone for the structural characterization of TorsinA. The crystal structures of TorsinA as well as the Dystonia mutant TorsinADE302/303, both in complex with the activator LULL1, have been determined. These structures may lead to the development of a drug that can rescue the weakened TorsinADE302/303-activator interaction, with high potential of providing a cure for early-onset primary Dystonia.\n\nAdvantages: Our Team.

MIT,Modular Glaucoma Implant with VariableFlow,Case number: #19627,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/modular-glaucoma-implant-variable-flow,"This minimally invasive implantable device provides a more effective option for glaucoma treatment for patients with open angle glaucoma, angle closure glaucoma, and other forms of glaucoma.\n\nTechnology: This device is designed to treat Glaucoma by emptying aqueous humor from the anterior chamber to the suprachoridal space. It is composed of two main components: a fixation stent designed to be inserted into the Schlemm’s canal and drainage tubes that interface with the fixation stent via snap fits. Both components are made of biocompatible and hydrophobic polyimide. They are also non-porous, encouraging biological fixation. The fixation stent is designed to match the curvature of the Schlemm’s Canal, and to protrude into the anterior chamber. This provides stability without sutures and visual confirmation of proper surgical insertion. The fixation stent enables the surgeon to adjust the flow rate of aqueous humor because it allows for up to five drainage tubes to be inserted into it. Additionally, surgeons can utilize the drainage tubes to redirect flow in the case of clogging.\n\nProblem Addressed: Glaucoma is a disease caused by high intraocular pressure (IOP) due to poor drainage of the aqueous humor from the anterior chamber. This can damage the optic nerve, leading to blindness if left untreated. Trabeculectomy, the removal of trabecula meshwork and adjacent structures to relieve IOP, is currently the most common method for treating Glaucoma due to its long-term success rate. However, it is an invasive procedure that requires a skilled surgeon and often results in scarring. Other treatments include minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) devices, daily medication, laser surgery, and glaucoma drainage devices. These devices are limited in efficacy due to problems with adherence, flow control, clogging, or stability in fixation within the eye. These challenges can be solved by using this easily inserted glaucoma drainage device that features flow rate adjustability, flow redirection in the case of clogging, and improved mechanical fixation with minimal scarring.\n\nAdvantages: Improved mechanical fixation. Minimally invasive only requiring two corneal incisions without sutures for fixation. Ease of insertion with visual confirmation. Surgeons with varied skill levels can easily use the device. Flow rate adjustability. Capable of redirecting flow in the case of clogging. Fewer subsequent procedures. Minimal scarring"
MIT,Bone Reduction Forcep Allowing for Both Continuous and DiscreteAdjustment,Case number: #18507,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/bone-reduction-forcep-allowing-both-continuous-and,"This invention is a forcep design that allows both continuous and discrete force adjustment and an extra degree of freedom to provide quicker and more stable anatomic alignment in fracture reduction.\n\nTechnology: This invention has three design features to improve surgical outcomes.  First, a clutchable worm and rack locking mechanism allows for fine control as well as gross adjustment over the tightening and loosening of the forceps. Current devices increase clamping force in discrete intervals and, when released, release all of their force at once. Alternatively, existing fine control mechanisms allow for sensitive control to achieve proper anatomic alignment, but are slow and cumbersome to use, and often do not allow for a desirable “complete release” feature. This design combines the best of both aspects, allowing a surgeon to achieve gross control for rapid alignment, with the added benefit of fine control when needed. Second, this technology contains a five-bar linkage which provides an increased mechanical advantage and as well as an additional degree of freedom for improved surgical control. Lastly, this design can incorporate a wide variety of interchangeable tips to reduce the number of tools necessary in a surgical suite. These three design features can be incorporated entirely independent of one another and can each be independently incorporated into existing reduction forcep architectures.\n\nProblem Addressed: Existing bone reduction forceps, used in over 200,000 hand surgeries annually, do not allow sufficiently fine adjustment of the clamping force resulting in longer, more difficult procedures, increasing the risk of further bone breaking, anesthesia complications, misunion, or nonunion. This invention is a forcep design that allows both continuous and discrete force adjustment and an extra degree of freedom to provide quicker and more stable anatomic alignment in fracture reduction. This forcep design may be used for hand reduction surgery or generalized to forceps for larger bones and other surgical tools.\n\nAdvantages: Continuous and discrete adjustment. Increased mechanical advantage. Additional degree of freedom. Interchangeable tips reduce cost and variety of tools needed to supply a surgical suite"
MIT,Distributed Nanowire Sensor for Single PhotonImaging,Case number: #18503,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/distributed-nanowire-sensor-single-photon-imaging,"This technology has applications in biological imaging, quantum computing, and deep space communications.\n\nTechnology: The invention is a new architecture for a single superconducting nanowire, which uses hundreds of pixels to spatially resolve single photons. Using a simple readout method with only two radio frequency output lines and conventional room-temperature electronics, the design is a detector that is sensitive enough to detect a single photo with high quantum efficiency, low dark counts and low timing jitter. The resulting nanowire is easily shapeable for either a large active area for astronomical observation or sub-micrometer spatial resolution for near-field imaging. The number of distinguishable pixels is only limited by the total length of the nanowire and the timing accuracy for reading out the electrical pulses.\n\nProblem Addressed: The development of a camera with single-photon sensitivity and sub-micrometer spatial resolution has applications in many scientific fields. Although superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have superior performance to other discrete detectors, integrating multiple SNSPDs into an array for single-photon imaging is difficult, because of the complexity of signal processing and the cooling requirements of cryogenic designs.\n\nAdvantages: High quantum efficiency, low dark counts, and low timing jitter single photon detector. Simple readout method requires only two radio frequency output lines and conventional room-temperature electronics. Nanowire easily shapeable for either a large active area for astronomical observation or sub-micrometer spatial resolution for near-field imaging"
MIT,Efficient and Reliable Transmission of Sparse Signals in Wireless SensorNetworks,Case number: #18468,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/efficient-and-reliable-transmission-sparse-signals,"The invention is a low complexity architecture for communicating captured sparse signals in WSNs, with applications in health monitoring as well as industrial and consumer sector networks.\n\nTechnology: The application-independent physical layer design leverages sparsity existing in many physical signals to parsimoniously represent them. By preserving the relative bit importance during transmission, it achieves graceful tradeoffs between distortion and channel SNR, resulting in increased robustness against channel errors across a wide range of SNR values in a rateless fashion. The invention was proved to be optimal in terms of distortion in the high SNR regime in point-to-point links and can efficiently serve multicast scenarios. The device is applicable to a wide range of applications and performs close to an idealized layered transmission scheme in terms of reliability and end-to-end distortion.\n\nProblem Addressed: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are an emerging technology that will have a major societal, environmental and financial impact. By 2020, it is predicted that there will be more than 50 million interconnected nodes worldwide. WSNs seek to capture compressible analog signals and aim to transmit them reliably to one or more nodes, while maintaining low power consumption. Technical challenges include achieving communication reliability under delay constrains in harsh environments and limiting power consumption to ensure extended lifetimes. Current methods are often highly application specific. In addition, they do not work well in environments with unknown signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, have limited performance in multiuser scenarios and lack feedback functionality.\n\nAdvantages: Application and signal model independent communication architecture. Simultaneous service of multiple receivers at their highest possible information rate. No receiver feedback needed for optimal rate selection. No computationally intense algorithms in transmitting sensor nodes"
MIT,Concepts and Methods for Controlling Chemical Reaction Kinetics and Interaction Time in LargeSystems,Case number: #18377,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/concepts-and-methods-controlling-chemical-reaction,"The ability to finely control kinetics and molecular interactions in large systems can be applied to any sort of experiment where proteome analysis is invaluable. It is especially useful in any experiment where preservation of the structural and antigenic integrity of the tissue is crucial.\n\nTechnology: This invention comprises the SWITCH system (System-Wide control of Interaction Time and kinetics of Chemicals), to tightly control a broad range of chemical reactions in tissue processing and proteomic labeling. A SWITCH-On buffer facilitates chemical reactions between exogenous chemicals and endogenous biomolecules, and a SWTICH-Off buffer suppresses the reactions. These buffers can be used easily to turn tissue into a transparent, heat- and chemical-resistant, architecturally preserved, molecularly labeled structure without needing to fix it with traditional methods. SWITCH can be used to control the rate at which probes penetrate through tissue to label the molecules of interest; thus, it can be used to clear very thick tissue, such as an entire rat brain. The SWITCH system has been used to successfully pass postmortem human tissue through a minimum of 22 rounds of SWITCH labeling with more than 100 targets, all visualized at subcellular resolution. In addition, it has also been used successfully label myelinated axons in intact mouse brain hemispheres. Finally, it has been used successfully to label 1-mm-thick mouse brain blocks with antibodies. The fact that this system is inexpensive and experimentally simple allows for its implementation in most labs.\n\nProblem Addressed: Many proteome analysis technologies, such as array tomography, that are used to label and visualize 3D pieces of tissue do not allow for the joint measurement of many molecular and anatomical traits in the same piece of tissue or are difficult to implement in most labs. In recent years, tissue-clearing techniques, such as CLARITY, have enabled scientists to pass each piece of tissue through a few rounds of labeling, in order to visualize the interactions between different cell types and molecules in the same sample. However, the tissue loses structural integrity upon repeated rounds of relabeling. A simple tissue-clearing technique that preserves the structural integrity of tissue after many rounds of relabeling will greatly improve upon current 3D tissue imaging techniques.\n\nAdvantages: Simple, scalable, broadly applicable tissue proteome labeling system. High-dimensional, multi-scale labeling. Subcellular resolution of dyes, antibodies, and myelination. Easy implementation in most labs. Virtually unlimited rounds of relabeling possible without disrupting the structural integrity of tissue"
MIT,Concepts and Methods for Magnifying Whole Intact Tissues While Preserving Their Structural and MolecularInformation,Case number: #18367,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/concepts-and-methods-magnifying-whole-intact-tissues,"This technology is a technique that facilitates 3D imaging of whole organs/tissues with multiplexed protein labeling and has many applications as an imaging tool.\n\nTechnology: This technology uses tissue-hydrogel complexes to facilitate processing and imaging of whole organs. First, the organ is perfused with a very high concentration of acrylamide hydrogel, with or without fixative. The high concentration of hydrogel results in formation of methylene bridges between the hydrogel and protein and reduces protein-protein crosslinking. After a denaturation step, the tissue is put in an expansion solution that expands and clears the tissue through osmotic flux into the hydrogel. The tissue-hydrogel complex expands up to 4-fold linearly in all directions while maintaining the three-dimensional structure of the organ, since the proteins are linked to the hydrogel. This technique, called magnified analysis of proteome (MAP), results in cleared organs that can be imaged on diffraction-limited microscopes. MAP is generalizable between organ systems and the inventors tested clearing and imaging of many tissues, including brain, heart, lung, kidney, spinal cord, and liver. Importantly, MAP maintains the molecular integrity of antigens, and most off the shelf commercial antibodies tested were compatible with MAP expansion and clearing. Antigens in the tissue are also stable through multiple rounds of stripping and re-probing, which allows multiplexed protein expression profiling. Additionally, the inventors describe a modified version of this protocol that facilitates MAP imaging of previously preserved tissues, allowing imaging of stored organs or tissue samples, such as post-mortem tissue or stored biopsies.\n\nProblem Addressed: Understanding molecular structure and function of organs has great potential to inform disease treatments and tissue engineering research. An organ’s function is a result of both the constituent cell identities and their three-dimensional interactions. It was previously impossible to study long range 3D tissue structure, but the recent development of chemical organ clearing techniques has now made it possible to image an organ in its entirety. However, the current organ clearing and imaging techniques still have many issues, including long clearing timescales, specialized equipment or solutions, and loss of antigen integrity. These inventors have developed a novel method for clearing and expanding organs that allows visualization of whole organs with multiplexed protein imaging.\n\nAdvantages: 3D visualization of whole organs with multiplexed proteomic imaging. Compatible with whole organs or with cultured cells/organoids of many tissue types. Antigens are preserved through multiple rounds of stripping and re-probing for multiplexed imaging. Reversible expansion of organ/tissue that maintains long range 3D structure. Facilitates super-resolution microscopy with diffraction-limited light/fluorescence microscopes. Compatible with either fresh or previously stored tissues/organs"
MIT,TripEnergy,Case number: #18210,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/tripenergy,"TripEnergy is a data processing methodology that turns incomplete information on vehicle travel into a predictive estimate of the energy requirements of travel. It is designed to work with personal vehicle trips, producing energy estimates given information such as trip distance and/or duration from a survey. It can also work with low-resolution vehicle trajectories reconstructed from historical traffic data or generated in a transport network simulation. The model is capable of estimating energy requirements for a large variety of internal combustion and battery electric vehicles and can be extended to apply to a wide variety of vehicle types including bus, heavy rail, and ridesharing.\n\nTechnology: TripEnergy uses a demand model and vehicle model to estimate personal vehicle energy consumption for which only limited information is available. The demand model takes limited-resolution input information on a trip's characteristics and matches it with a large set of possible high-resolution velocity histories arising from similar trips. This set of trips spans the range of driving conditions that could be associated with that trip through realistic use. If ambient temperature is not supplied as an input, the demand model also produces a set of possible ambient temperatures for that trip based on the location, time of day, and day of the year on which the trip was taken. This set of velocity histories and temperatures is fed into the vehicle model which converts them into a distribution of possible energy requirements of that trip. The vehicle model is extensively calibrated based on test data and validated through vehicle simulation software, accounting for tractive energy consumption, conversion efficiency, and climate control auxiliary use.\n\nProblem Addressed: There is great value in an accurate prediction of a trip’s energy consumption, particularly if the prediction can be made for many trips in a population of drivers and vehicles. This is particularly true as electric vehicles become more common and regions work to limit air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, trip energy consumption is often either estimated based simply on the vehicle's rated fuel economy and a trip's distance. Alternatively, these estimates are done through complex, black-box simulations that require detailed information on the trip characteristics which cannot be predicted in advance. These simulations are also slow to run and difficult to operate at scale for large datasets, in real time. TripEnergy combines the analytic rigor of simulation methods with ease of use and flexibility and is particularly geared towards predictive estimates of trips’ energy consumption across a population.\n\nAdvantages: TripEnergy produces accurate estimates for the energy requirements of trips without requiring extensive additional data collection about the conditions of the trips or vehicle performance characteristics. Rather, it uses existing databases. The model has been shown to be accurate based on extensive validation. This unique capability is based on new insights on travel energy consumption behaviors.. Because of its unmatched computational efficiency, TripEnergy can provide real-time feedback to users regarding the energy impacts of their choices.. Realistic energy use predictions will allow drivers, apps, and policy makers to choose or incentivize travel choices that maximize energy efficiency and minimize pollution. This is in contrast to imperfect proxies such as total travel time or total vehicle miles traveled.. The functionality can extend beyond vehicular energy consumption to monitor other sources of energy consumption in daily life. For example, it allows users to track the carbon impact of their lifestyle choices in real time and predictively evaluate the energy and pollution effects of buying a new vehicle, moving to a new household, and installing residential solar panels. The model provides a unique degree of accuracy that allows the impact of such sources to be reliably quantified."
MIT,Pre-Fever Detection ofInfection,Case number: #18027LJ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/pre-fever-detection-infection,"These are methods for detecting pathogen exposure before symptoms become apparent. This detection could lead to earlier patient care and increase the probability of a positive prognosis. These methods may help to reduce transmission during infectious disease outbreaks by enabling monitoring patient exposure without patient isolation or contact tracing. They may also have applications in the clinical setting, helping to treat post-operative or critical care patients well before they present with symptoms such as viremia, bacteremia, or sepsis.\n\nTechnology: These techniques provide early warning of infection by monitoring physiological states before symptoms become apparent. Using machine learning models, these methods train classifiers with non-invasive patient data of physical waveforms, such as those from electrocardiography, hemodynamics, and temperature. They then apply those classifiers over a number of time intervals when analyzing an unknown patient’s data. Either the number of predictive patient state classifications or an aggregated patient state classification can then be used to indicate whether a patient has been exposed to an infectious or chemical agent. These are techniques with high sensitivity and low specificity.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current state-of-the-art techniques for detecting pathogen exposure often utilize molecular diagnostics. These methods suffer from steep logistic burdens and associated costs. They are rarely used until patients self-report or present symptoms. Less demanding techniques exist that process patients’ physiological signals for the early detection of infection. However, these techniques utilize strongly-confounded signals such as heart rate, fever, and body core temperature. There is a need for  technologies, such as these, that are capable of accurately processing traditionally confounded physiological signals to indicate whether a patient has been exposed to a viral infection, bacterial infection, or other communicable pathogens.\n\nAdvantages: Pre-symptomatic indication. Capable of processing simple physiological signals. Can be used in public health or hospital settings"
MIT,"Plasmons for Spectroscopic, Light Emission, and Broadband Light GenerationApplications",Case number: #18398,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/plasmons-spectroscopic-light-emission-and-broadband,"This technology comprises apparatuses and methods to enhance access and observability of slow light emission properties. The technology can be used to create light emitters for organic light sources, broadband light emission, and spectroscopy.\n\nTechnology: This technology comprises multiple apparatuses to access slow electron transitions for spectroscopy, broadband emission, and quenching. The spectroscopy platform uses a radiation source to emit an excitation beam into a conductive layer, generating a 2D plasmon field. A probe beam then illuminates the testing sample in the 2D plasmon field. The sample absorbs spectral components of the probe beam, which is measured by a detector.\n\nProblem Addressed: Transition processes emit light when excited electrons return to a relaxed state. Multipolar transitions produce data on the electronic structure of a material through spectroscopy. Quenching (the process of decreasing fluorescence intensity) of organic molecules can be achieved with spin-flip transitions. Broadband light sources, which turn a monochromatic beam of light into a broadband beam, can be built based on multiphoton transitions.\n\nAdvantages: Enhance access and observability of slow light emission processes. Enable the development of emitters for spectroscopy, broadband light beams, and organic light sources. Tunable quenching for organic light sources through electron density conduction"
MIT,Gel-Electrospinning Process for High Performance PolymerNanofibers,Case number: #18241,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/gel-electrospinning-process-high-performance-polymer,"This technology can be applied to make polymer nano-fibers with mechanical properties comparable to conventional high-performance fibers. These fibers might be used to develop all-polymer composites for use in body armor.\n\nTechnology: In the novel process described by the Inventors, a polymer filament is formed by electrospinning at elevated temperature. During this process, the filament undergoes electrostatically driven drawing and whipping processes that stretch it and reduce its diameter to sub-micron levels. Unlike conventional electrospinning, the drawing and whipping processes take place at elevated temperatures. The process temperatures are chosen so that the solution filament undergoes a gel transition as it is stretched, which increases the degree of molecular orientation in the resulting fiber and improves its mechanical properties. For example, the Inventors have successfully produced UHMWPE fibers with a diameter of 0.3 µm and a Young’s modulus of approximately 120 GPa -- comparable to that of conventional Spectra fibers.\n\nProblem Addressed: Conventional high-performance polymer fibers are produced using a process known as gel spinning. These fibers have excellent mechanical properties such as modulus and strength. However, gel spinning is unable to produce fibers with sub-micron diameters due to limitations in the ability of mechanical systems to exert the larger hydraulic forces required and to interface with sub-micron scale fibers.\n\nAdvantages: Superior mechanical properties compared to conventional electrospun sub-micron fibers. Higher specific surface area and toughness compared to conventional high performance fibers. Orders of magnitude higher productivity compared to production of high-performance sub-micron fibers by tip drawing"
MIT,Micelle Laden Hydrogels for NanocrystalSynthesis,Case number: #19070,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/micelle-laden-hydrogels-nanocrystal-synthesis,"This technology involves a novel, synthesized hydrogel scaffold for the production of nanocrystals as small as 5 nm using a low energy crystallization method. This technology is of particular interest to the pharmaceutical industry, contract research organizations, and contract manufacturing organizations.\n\nTechnology: This technology involves the synthesis of a hydrogel scaffold, with a matrix composed of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) that can produce crystals as small as 5nm using solvent evaporation - a low energy crystallization method. Through this production method, nanocrystals are in a chemically and mechanically protective environment, thereby enhancing their stability and control on polymorphism and dissolution.\n\nProblem Addressed: The production of nanocrystals is typically accomplished using high energy methods such as ultrasonication, spray drying, or mechanical milling. Once crystals are reduced in size below 1000 nm, they are much less stable than bulk crystals, making them difficult to process and store. However, this reduced stability leads to rapid dissolution, which is beneficial for applications such as pharmaceuticals in which quick release of an active ingredient is preferable. This technology uses a low energy crystallization method that through solvent evaporation enables the production of crystals as small as 5nm in size, which allows for a more stable control on polymorphism and dissolution. This makes possible the production of custom-made crystal sizes of hydrophobic active pharmaceutical ingredients.\n\nAdvantages: Hydrogel scaffold can produce crystals as small as 5 nm in size. Nanocrystals with enhance stability and control on polymorphism and dissolution. Production of custom-made crystal sizes of hydrophobic active pharmaceutical ingredients"
MIT,3D Cryogenic Packaging for SuperconductingComputing,Case number: #19039L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/3d-cryogenic-packaging-superconducting-computing,"Superconducting computing offers an attractive low-power alternative to CMOS. Cryogenic packaging with 3D integration will allow superconducting computer circuits to fit within cryogenic chambers.\n\nTechnology: A superconducting computing architecture with a scalable cryogenic 3D integration approach is the solution to these requirements. This approach yields the ability to design computing circuitry to fit the cryogenic space, rather than adjusting the cryogenic space to fit the computer circuits. The cryogenic package includes multiple superconducting multi-chip modules, which connect to each other with room temperature semiconductor components. This structure allows the selection of the best possible, commercially available, superconducting die and components from various suppliers. The 3D design minimizes the use of physical space, and maximizes superconducting paths, to increase processing speeds and decrease signal path resistance.\n\nProblem Addressed: In the realm of computing, superconducting integrated circuits greatly outperform CMOS with many advantages including faster switching speeds, low dissipative switching, and the use of small current pulses for information transfer. The major challenge is the lack of existing high performance integration schemes that meet the stringent requirements of cryogenic applications. Current technologies cannot provide an integration scheme that accommodates the thousands of single flux quantum chips needed for operation. Other requirements include high integration density per chip, a substantially miniaturized cryogenic cooling setup, low-resistance signal paths, and stability over cryogenic temperature ranges.\n\nAdvantages: 3D cryogenic integration approach shrinks superconducting computing hardware to small enough area to fit in cryogenic chamber. Decreased electrical resistance in signal path, increased processing speed"
MIT,Compositions and Methods to Increase Muscular Strength WithoutExercise,Case number: #19768,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/compositions-and-methods-increase-muscular-strength,"This technology has applications in the medical field for muscle regeneration and rehabilitation to increase strength and mobility in bed-ridden patients such as those with cancer cachexia as well as for performance improvement in athletes.\n\nTechnology: This invention is a therapeutic strategy which amplifies muscle force. The transient disruption of the cytoskeletal network within muscle cells decreases stiffness and internal resistance in muscles. This breakdown can be achieved by a variety of therapeutic agents, including small molecules or polypeptides which induce breakdown of filamentous actin (F-actin) in the cytoskeleton via the depolymerization of F-actin or the disruption of microtubules or intermediate filaments in skeletal or smooth muscle. Subsequently, when the cytoskeletal network is rebuilt, muscle cells demonstrate at least a two-fold increase in force exertion abilities within hours post-treatment. This technology facilitates increases in muscle strength without exercise.\n\nProblem Addressed: Millions of bed-ridden patients experience loss of muscle strength. Decreased use of muscles leads to an increase in internal resistance in skeletal muscle cells, thereby limiting the force that muscles can exert. This results in the development of muscle wasting disorders, such as cachexia and sarcopenia, which ultimately impair mobility and decrease patients’ quality of life. Furthermore, muscle weakness can also be caused by strenuous exercise or long breaks from exercise. Currently, methods to increase muscle strength involve tedious resistance exercises which require much time and effort before improvements in strength are observed. This technology improves muscle strength through therapeutic targeting of the cytoskeletal network within muscle cells.\n\nAdvantages: Easier to implement than exercise to increase muscle strength. Faster results - improved muscle strength can be observed in just hours after treatment. Methodology can be applied to a wide variety of medical indications associated with muscle wasting. Can also be applied to healthy muscle tissues for athletes seeking quicker recovery in muscle strength"
MIT,Photoexcitation of Intermediates to Accelerate Photocatalyst Regeneration and Increase itsEfficiency,Case number: #18946,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/photoexcitation-intermediates-accelerate,"A novel photocatalyst to counter oxygen inhibition in the polymerization and crosslinking reactions initiated by radicals could be used in the synthesis of hydrogels in biomedicine, where oxygen must always be present.\n\nTechnology: This invention comprises a photocatalyst, Eosin Y, which acts aqueously during the radical polymerization of hydrogel precursor polyethylene glycol dicacrylate (PEGDA) to confer resilience to oxygen inhibition. In general, photocatalysts are substances that absorb light to increase the speed of a reaction and are able to regenerate anew for each round of reactions. Eosin Y, in particular, interacts with triethanolamine (TEOA) in a reaction cycle that is driven by two separate wavelengths of light applied at two different times during the reaction cycle. These wavelengths ensure a higher rate of catalyst regeneration and thus reduce Eosin Y “death,” or inhibition, over multiple cycles. In each reaction cycle, Eosin Y interacts with oxygen molecules to prevent them from inhibiting the polymerization of PEGDA. This mechanism, as well as the optimum wavelengths for photocatalysis, were verified with spectroscopic data. Based on these data, hundreds of O2 molecules are consumed per photon absorbed.\n\nProblem Addressed: Polymerization and crosslinking reactions are widely used in the synthesis of hydrogels in biomedicine. However, oxygen present in physiological conditions inhibits these reactions by oxidizing the reagents. A novel regenerating photocatalyst that could react with oxygen upon photostimulation would prevent oxygen from inhibiting the reaction in such a manner.\n\nAdvantages: Novel photocatalyst used in the synthesis of hydrogels for biomedical purposes. Increased efficiency of photocatalyst regeneration by two particular wavelengths of light. Reduction of oxygen inhibition in hydrogel formation"
MIT,High-Throughput Native Context Mapping of the RegulatoryGenome,Case number: #18012JQ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/high-throughput-native-context-mapping-regulatory,"This invention is a high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9-based approach that analyzes the regulatory genome for function in its native context. Understanding gene regulation for improved control allows for a number of applications including better management of stem cell differentiation.\n\nTechnology: CRISPR/Cas (has been used in genome-wide mutation screens to identify genes required for survival, drug resistance, and tumor metastasis. MERA improves upon this previous gene mutation screening approach by ensuring cells receive a precise number of guide RNA (gRNA) per cell (i.e., one or more than one for combinatorial studies) and allows for gRNA libraries to be used without any laborious molecular cloning into a delivery vector. These methods can be used to screen for the effect of mutations anywhere in the genome.\n\nProblem Addressed: Gene regulation, which underlies human variation, disease, and cancer, is poorly understood making it difficult to predict the effects of cis-regulatory variants on gene expression and to predictively alter gene expression during stem cell differentiation and reprogramming. Currently, there is no high-throughput approach capable of determining the relative importance of each gene regulatory element on native gene expression levels. This technology, Multiplexed Editing Regulatory Assay (MERA), enables the analysis of the regulatory genome at single base resolution in its native context.\n\nAdvantages: Single base resolution. No repeated and laborious cloning steps. High-throughput"
MIT,Block Copolymers for 3DPrinting,Case number: #17939LJ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/block-copolymers-3d-printing,"The combination of a crowded RF spectrum and the requirement for high-bandwidth communications has created a need for low-loss high frequency RF devices. High precision 3D printing of dielectrics offers improved device properties and performance and supports complex fabrication not traditionally possible with subtractive manufacturing. The technology can be applied to fully integrated GHz and THz devices, flexible electronics, and microfluidic devices.\n\nTechnology: The invention describes an ink formulation and method of making a 3D printed RF device. The ink consists of a triblock copolymer in a solvent, and one or more additives that can enhance the flow of the ink and improve properties of the end structure, including dielectric properties. The ink is viscoelastic, allowing for greater control over the rate and method of flow. The ink can include dielectric filler particles that alter the RF properties in a predictable fashion while maintaining micron scale resolution. The method describes extruding an ink formulation from a deposition nozzle moving relative to a substrate, which can increase the range of geometries of 3D structures to be built layer by layer. One or more continuous filaments comprising the ink formulation can be deposited in a predetermined pattern on the substrate.  Once printed, the ink formulation is treated to remove or cure the solvent, thereby forming a printed RF device.  Notably, this materials system and printing process allows for the fabrication of devices whose properties can be tailored in a graded pattern avoiding abrupt interfaces within the part.\n\nProblem Addressed: High resolution 3D printing has significant advantages for enhancing device performance and reducing size, weight and power (SWaP). However, applications thus far have been limited by the lack of appropriate materials and printing processes. Current fabrication methods are costly, offer limited material selection and are inflexible to customization. Machining the polymeric and ceramic materials used for high-frequency devices can be difficult and laborious.\n\nAdvantages: Complex multi-layered structures direct from design. Low loss polymer material printing with high resolution and low surface roughness. Enhanced properties and performance for advanced RF devices. Fabrication of devices not possible by conventional methods. Radically improved efficiency of high frequency devices"
MIT,Synthesis of Polyphosphorylated Molecules Directly fromPolyphosphates,Case number: #20486,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/synthesis-polyphosphorylated-molecules-directly,"This invention is immediately suitable for commercialization as a reagent to triphosphorylate nucleophilic substrates. The chemical species generated by this invention allows for much easier synthesis of triphosphorylated molecules utilized in the biochemistry and pharmacological communities. The invention can be used in lieu of existing commercial methods for the large-scale production of triphosphorylated molecules. Additionally, an extremely broad class of molecules can be synthesized using this invention, including mono, di, tri, tetra, and hexaphosphorylated molecules.\n\nTechnology: In one step, this invention triphosphorylates nucleophilic substrates like alcohols, amines, and phosphates. Trimetaphosphate serves as the phosphate source and is combined with a coupling reagent to generate an activated species. The activated species can be reacted with nucleophilic substrates to produce functionalized trimetaphosphate derivatives that can be easily isolated and purified by crystallization. Rapid hydrolysis of trimetaphosphate derivatives in water is finally used to generate linear triphosphate products. The invention can also be applied to generate linear, branched, and cyclic polyphosphates (including mono, di, tri, tetra, and hexaphosphorylated molecules).\n\nProblem Addressed: Intense, and therefore costly synthesis is needed to generate many polyphosphorylated biomolecules relevant to biochemical and pharmacological research, due to the difficulty of obtaining these molecules from biological sources. Additionally, no single phosphorylation method is acceptable for all desired biological substrates. As a result, even relatively common polyphosphorylated substrates are extremely expensive from commercial sources. Known reactions to triphosphorylate substrates in one step are low yielding and require costly purification of products. These inventors have developed a high yielding method for the synthesis of triphosphorylated molecules directly from trimetaphosphate combined with a simple isolation and purification procedure for products. As a result, the generation of triphosphorylated molecules is much more cost efficient than current methods and can be extended to a variety of previously excluded substrates.\n\nAdvantages: First of its kind activated species generated from trimetaphosphate. High yielding, one step synthesis of triphosphates derivatives that is more cost effective and easier to purify than current methods. Novel access to previously inaccessible substrates facilitates the generation and commercialization of highly desired polyphosphorylated entities"
MIT,Drug Delivery Based on BistableMembrane,Case number: #17624,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/drug-delivery-based-bistable-membrane,"This technology is a long-term, reversibly controllable drug delivery device with therapeutic, diagnostic, or prophylactic applications.\n\nTechnology: This invention employs a bistable member that allows for a non-electronic drug delivery device to permit passive diffusion in one state while stopping drug release in a second state. A number of device designs are envisioned but generally consist of a housed drug reservoir and a bistable member, such as a membrane or ribbon. Changes in device state not only adjust drug release rates, but also allows this device to be applied to a diverse set of medical applications. The simple device is constructed with biocompatible, polymeric materials. Once placed subcutaneously, a patient can feel its configuration with the help of fiducial features such as surface patterning. The patient can reversibly and mechanically change the device between the two states without special tools or medical training. This technology creates long-term drug delivery devices that give patients reversible control of drug release.\n\nProblem Addressed: Long-term, implantable drug delivery devices are used for a variety of medical purposes. There are currently two main device designs which suffer from major flaws. The first more traditional design includes a polymeric matrix material that maintains a passive and continuous release of drugs. However, the device cannot be turned off or regulated and must be surgically removed by a medical professional to cease drug release. Recently, a second device design that can deliver an actively controlled release utilizing electronics has been developed. However, this device design is relatively complex and expensive. This invention introduces a new, inexpensive device design that allows a patient to reversibly control drug release over extended periods of time. This device is especially applicable in developing countries where it will allow patients without ready access to a physician control over their own dosing.\n\nAdvantages: Superior to current passive devices since release can be reversibly controlled by patients without the use of tools or medical expertise. Improvement on existing devices since there is no need for electronics or power, simplifying manufacturing and reducing cost. Reservoir reduces sensitivity to drug formulation. High packing ratio compared to current devices allows for a smaller device. Rate of drug release may be controlled solely by the device structure and is independent of drug amount or loading method"
MIT,Extremely Compliant Yet Tough Hydrogel Systems as Ultrasound TransmissionAgents,Case number: #17559,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/extremely-compliant-yet-tough-hydrogel-systems,"This technology has applications as an ultrasound transmission agent.\n\nTechnology: Resilience and toughness are intrinsically contradictory properties for a material -- high resilience requires low mechanical dissipation while high toughness requires high mechanical dissipation when undergoing material deformation.  This invention pertains to a new innovative method and material system to design both extremely tough and resilient hydrogels.  The extraordinary properties of the new hydrogels are achieved through the mechanism of delayed stiffening and mechanical dissipation.  The hydrogels can be formed and printed into various shapes with different dimensions.  One particular application of the new gel system is as ultrasound transmission agents.  This extremely soft and tough hydrogel can conform to varying contours of both the human body and the ultrasound probe.\n\nProblem Addressed: Typically, liquid gel is used in ultrasound procedures to improve the transmission of the ultrasound signals from the transducer to the body.  However, conventional liquid hydrogels dry quickly or drip off the patient’s skin quickly.  This new compliant and tough hydrogel conforms to the contours of the human body and remains effective for at least 30 minutes.\n\nAdvantages: Low shear modulus, can be conformably attached to different regions of human body and wrap ultrasound probes of complex shapes. Extremely robust. Produces high quality ultrasound images comparable to that of conventional liquid hydrogels without dripping or drying up"

Each field emitter consists of a conical silicon tip on a high-aspect ratio silicon column. When a bias voltage is applied to the emitter, the pointed geometry of the tip creates a concentrated electric field which severely distorts D2 molecules and induces dissociation. In an alternate mode of operation, a positive voltage is applied between emitter tips and their respective gates, causing them to emit electrons. These electrons are subsequently accelerated and collided with D2 molecules, leading to ionization. In both operational modes, the high-aspect ratio silicon columns underlying the emitter tips serve as built-in current limiters, which protect the sharp emitter tips from premature degradation as a result of bombardment by backstreaming deuterium ions.\n\nProblem Addressed: The ion source is an important component of a neutron source. Successful development of a portable neutron source depends on the development of a compact, lightweight, and low power ion source. Conventional methods of ionizing deuterium uses microwave plasma sources, which are attractive because of the high ion current and current density attainable. However, even considering power savings enabled by recent advances in inductively coupled microwave plasma sources, size, weight, and power requirements remain major limitations for these devices. This invention describes a novel MEMS-based deuterium ionizer that significantly outperforms existing ion sources on all three criteria.\n\nAdvantages: Significantly outperforms conventional RF ion sources in size, weight, and power consumption (volume < 2 L; weight < 10 lbs; power consumption < 200 W)"
MIT,The Method for the Self-Powered Detection of Nitroaromatics Using a Wild TypePlant,Case number: #18319,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/method-self-powered-detection-nitroaromatics-using,"Nanobionic plant sensors can be utilized in a wide range of applications, including but not limited to monitoring of soil nutrient content, detection of potentially hazardous chemicals in groundwater, alerting for buried explosives, and quantification of atmospheric gas content.\n\nTechnology: In this invention, plant sensors are created by infiltrating leaves with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) embedded with macromolecules. Embedded SWCNTs emit near infrared (nIR) signals in response to laser excitation at 785 nm.  Exposure of these SWCNTs to other macromolecules either attenuates or shifts their emission spectrum, which can then be recorded by a standoff detector placed a meter away. In one iteration of this invention, SWCNTs embedded with bombolitin can be used to detect picric acid, a nitroaromatic compound commonly found in explosives. When picric acid is absorbed from ground water and delivered through the symplastic pathway from the roots to the plant xylem and leaves, it quickly decreases the fluorescence of the SWCNTs embedded in the leaves. SWCNT-embedded spinach leaves showed a drop in emission intensity only 5-15 mintues after picric acid exposure to the roots of the plant. Quenching of fluorescence reached its maximum at 60 minutes, when the emission intensity was only on average 85% of the original intensity. When picric acid droplets were absorbed directly into the leaf cuticles, quenching of nIR emission was detected at 10 s and fluorescence signal reached a plateau at 400 s. This invention could be extended to include different nIR detector components and hand-held signal receivers, as well as to enable surreptitious, self-powered monitoring of a wide variety of environmental conditions.\n\nProblem Addressed: A nanobionic approach to the development of plant sensors bypasses the constraints that previous methods have experienced. In the past, plant sensors were created through genetic modifications. These approaches are limited to plants that have been extensively studied and well-understood, such as the tobacco plant; furthermore, they require long periods of time to perfect. On the other hand, nanobionic sensing mechanisms can be developed and tested very quickly, and mechanisms developed for one species are often easily translatable to another. In brief, nanobionic engineering provide results that are both more versatile and more efficiently obtained.\n\nAdvantages: Remote, self-powered sensing. Quickly developed. Trans-species applicability. Real-time monitoring capability"
MIT,Protein Corona Phase Molecular Recognition(CoPhMoRe),Case number: #18316,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/protein-corona-phase-molecular-recognition-cophmore,"This invention is applicable to any research-- industrial, medical, clinical, or otherwise-- that would require high-throughput screening with the goal of finding an optically active nanoparticle that is able to recognize a specific biological molecule. It can replace macromolecule detection methods and protein assays both in vitro and in vivo, such as ELISA or lateral flow strips, immunohistochemistry, and protein-resin binding, for real-time diagnostics. It can also be used therapeutically to block receptor-ligand interactions.\n\nTechnology: This invention introduces a novel synthetic recognition scheme for macromolecules that, unlike natural systems, is not constrained by cost or production scale and can withstand long-term storage. The synthetic recognizer is comprised of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) with adsorbed heteropolymer on its surface. This is achieved through the dialysis of a surfactant-SWCNT suspension in the presence of the heteropolymer for wrapping exchange. The hydrophobic segments of the polymer are adsorbed onto the hydrophobic surface of the SWCNT. This pushes the hydrophilic portions into the surrounding solution, forming a corona phase that is unique to the configuration of the heteropolymer and capable of recognizing target analytes. Previous work has demonstrated that these sensors are capable of recognizing small molecules, such as riboflavin, L-thyroxine, and small neurotransmitters, and a recent screen has suggested that they are also capable of recognizing macromolecules. Of 14 protein analytes and 20 distinct SWCNT corona phases screened, a particular corona phase molecular recognition (CoPhMoRe) scheme using SWCNT suspended in a phospholipid-PEG construct was discovered to be capable of recognizing fibrinogen, a blood plasma macromolecule protein. Screening for binding was accomplished through detecting spectral changes corresponding to analyte binding, such as fluorescent intensity and emission wavelength modulation, both of which are fast and easy to perform. Atomic force microscopy, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation measurements, and kinetic measurements all suggest that fibrinogen physically binds to the CoPhMoRe phase owing to a unique 3D interaction between the conformation of the corona phase and the fibrinogen molecule. Since even such a small screen was capable of identifying the strong binding specificity of a particular corona phase to a macromolecule, future screens will likely identify many other such interactions.\n\nProblem Addressed: Currently, the most advanced, widely used molecular recognition schemes involve natural systems, including antibodies and aptamers. Natural recognition schemes are limited by the need for a living organism or by problems such as degradation, instability, cost, and production scale that natural recognition schemes face. Synthetic recognition schemes such as molecular imprinting have been able to recognize small molecules, but no method for identifying macromolecules has been successful.\n\nAdvantages: High specificity macromolecule recognition. Fast screening for macromolecule binding to corona phase. Applicability to. in vivo. and. in vitro. screening assays and therapeutics. Stable, cost-effective, and mass-producible. Can be applied to small molecule recognition as well"
MIT,Potent Agelastatin Derivatives as Modulators for Cancer Invasion andMetastasis,Case number: #19505J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/potent-agelastatin-derivatives-modulators-cancer,"This technology is a panel of agelastatin derivatives with applications as cancer anti-metastasis therapeutics.\n\nTechnology: This technology is a panel of agelastatin A (AgA) and agelastatin E (AgE) derivatives with anti-metastatic properties. AgA and AgE block metastasis by abrogating Tiam1-osteopontin induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is a key step in the metastasis of many cancers. These inventors demonstrated that AgA and AgE derivatives are highly effective in preventing breast cancer migration in. in vivo. assays at concentrations far below levels that are cytotoxic. In mouse breast cancer xenotransplantation studies AgA and AgE have no effect on primary tumor growth; however, strikingly, they block nearly all metastatic spread. Importantly, osteopontin has a pro-metastatic role in many other cancer types, suggesting that AgA/E may be generalizable anti-metastasis drugs for other cancer indications. The pre-clinical data all indicate that AgA and AgE are promising anti-metastasis drug candidates.\n\nProblem Addressed: An estimated 90% of cancer deaths are due to tumor metastasis, which is the dissemination of tumor cells from the primary tumor site to distant organs and tissues. Despite the fact that metastasis is the primary driver of cancer mortality, there has been very little drug development targeting metastasis inhibition, and there is only one FDA approved anti-metastasis drug on the market today. There is therefore a significant unmet need to develop drugs that block metastatic dissemination of cancer cells.\n\nAdvantages: Anti-metastasis drug candidates. Promising. in vitro. and. in vivo. pre-clinical data indicating effective metastasis inhibition. No toxicity at effective doses. in vitro. or. in vivo. Potentially generalizable to other cancer types in addition to breast cancer"
MIT,Method for Internal WoundHealing,Case number: #18253J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/method-internal-wound-healing,"This invention presents ingestible origami robots that can be controlled to move, manipulate, and accomplish clinically relevant tasks, such as removing a foreign body and patching a wound in the stomach.\n\nTechnology: The inventors have developed a biocompatible and biodegradable origami robot that can be swallowed to perform simple procedures in the stomach without any incisions or external tethers. Once in the stomach, the robot self-deploys and uses its body to patch a wound, such as an inflammation made by an accidentally swallowed button battery. The inventors have used the origami design to fold and embed the robot in an ice capsule which can be swallowed, carried to the stomach and deployed. It is there actuated by external magnetic fields and guided to the location of the battery where it dislodges the battery from the inflammation site. Using an artificial stomach, the position of the robot was visually observed, though in real clinical applications, Hall-effect sensors, a combination of ultrasound, and X-rays would be employed to determine the position. The ice dissolution approach enhances the probability of a proper attachment, as the magnet steadily reorients itself while the ice melts to maximize connection strength. This approach also reduces the risk of the magnet and the battery magnetically pinching the mucosa. After the battery and the robot are removed from the body through the GI tract, the patient swallows another ice capsule-enclosed-origami robot. This second robot walks across the stomach wall and patches the inflammation site by releasing a drug to the damaged area as it degrades.\n\nProblem Addressed: There has been considerable progress in interventional technologies for the gastrointestinal tract; large efforts are being directed towards microsurgical tools that are minimally invasive, biocompatible and biodegradable, multifunctional, and well accepted by the patient's immune system. One example of a clinical intervention where a multifunctional miniature robot is desired is the ingestion of button batteries. According to the National Capital Poison Center, more than 3500 people ingest batteries in the United States every year. 42 deaths and 169 cases with severe esophageal burns and subsequent complications have been reported. Considering the fatality of these accidents and the limited availability of efficient interventional tools to counteract them, the inventors approached this problem by deploying a miniature surgical robot in the stomach that can perform versatile medical and surgical tasks in vivo. Their approach requires no on-board electronics, allowing for a simple and minimally invasive robot, and a greater choice of biocompatible and biodegradable materials from which to fabricate them.\n\nAdvantages: Ingestible, controllable, biodegradable and biocompatible origami robot for patching stomach wounds and removing foreign objects. Concept of ice encapsulated deployable robot for safe transportation into the stomach. Integrated drug delivery layer within the origami robot design. External electromagnetic actuation system to remotely actuate the robots and the ice capsules"
MIT,Continuous Freeze-Drying of Pharmaceuticals and Biopharmaceuticals in UnitDoses,Case number: #19494J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/continuous-freeze-drying-pharmaceuticals-and,"This technology is a freeze-drying technique with potential applications in pharmaceutical and research reagent manufacturing.\n\nTechnology: This technology uses a continuous manufacturing line to freeze-dry pharmaceutical formulations. To freeze-dry a drug, the samples are (1) loaded into vials, (2) frozen, undergo a two-step drying process of (3) primary drying and (4) secondary drying, then are (5) backfilled/stoppered. In traditional freeze-drying manufacturing, these steps are done in large batches and require manual handling between steps, which results in long dead times. This technology performs all of the freeze-drying steps in a fully automated, continuous manufacturing line that includes filling, freezing, drying, and backfill/stoppering modules. This continuous freeze-drying system has three major improvements over batch freeze-drying. First, the continuous freeze-drying process is up to 5 times shorter than a traditional batch freeze-drying cycle. Secondly, the continuous freeze-drying line is autonomous and internally sterile, which cuts down on labor and increases the safety of the final product since because samples do not need to be manually transferred between steps. Finally, since all the samples pass through the same path, the final products have greater uniformity than those produced using batch freeze-drying. In summary, this technology can greatly improve the quality and speed of manufacturing for lyophilized drugs and research reagents.\n\nProblem Addressed: Freeze-drying (aka lyophilization) is commonly used to stabilize pharmaceuticals and research reagents for distribution and storage. Freeze-drying is very time intensive, requiring up to 300 hours to complete one cycle. Additionally, pharmaceuticals are freeze-dried in large batches, which can result in a high level of vial-to-vial variation in quality depending on the location of the vial in the lyophilization chamber. There is therefore a need for faster freeze-drying manufacturing techniques that result in more uniform final products.\n\nAdvantages: Up to 5 times shorter cycle time than batch freeze drying. No manual handling, increasing safety and ease-of-use. Greater final product uniformity in comparison to batch lyophilized products. Modular system that can be adapted to each product’s manufacturing needs"
MIT,Technique for SecureComputation,Case number: #18209J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/technique-secure-computation,"Ascend is a secure processor architecture that guarantees privacy of data in a cloud or cloud-like environment. This technology is highly relevant to cloud computing applications that involve maintaining sensitive information including financial information and medical records.\n\nTechnology: Ascend. considers cases where the program is supplied by the server, the user or a third party and can be either public or private (encrypted). The program is not trusted by the user in all cases. In this context to be “trusted,” a program must not be intentionally malicious and must be provably free of any bugs that have the potential to leak information about the program data. Data from the user is always considered private.\n\nProblem Addressed: Data privacy is a huge problem in cloud computing applications that require sensitive data to be stored and computed upon in the cloud. Computation requires the data to be exposed to the cloud servers, which may be attacked by malicious applications, hypervisors, operating systems or insiders. Encrypted computation has the potential to solve the data privacy problem. In encrypted computation, the user specifies encrypted inputs to a program, and the server computes on encrypted inputs to produce an encrypted result. This encrypted result is sent back to the user who decrypts it to get the actual result. The Inventors have developed. Ascend. ,. a secure processor architecture that supports private computation of arbitrary programs.\n\nAdvantages: Ascend is only marginally more complex than a conventional processor to implement. Periodic accesses to external instruction and data memory are performed through an Oblivious RAM (ORAM) interface to prevent leakage through memory access patterns"
MIT,Solid State Pump Using Electro-RheologicalFluid,Case number: #18205J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/solid-state-pump-using-electro-rheological-fluid,"This technology finds applications in various fields including micropumps for drug delivery, chemical analysis, and biological sensing, micro-hydraulic systems, as well as pitot tubes for measuring pressure differentials.\n\nTechnology: The inventors have designed a device for pumping electro-rheological fluid, via an applied time-periodic voltage gradient. This novel approach involves exerting electromagnetic forces on induced dipoles distributed within the fluid and exploiting drag forces to drive flow in the channel. The electromagnetic force derives from the horizontal cross-channel electric fields, provided by a folded flexible printed circuit wrapped around the channel walls. These multiple independent electrodes are powered by a time-periodic voltage gradient. This device primarily consists of three layers of acrylic sheets of which the middle one contains a channel. A variation of the device with pitot tubes is capable of measuring pressure differentials by the difference of the heights of the fluid surfaces in the pitot tubes.\n\nProblem Addressed: Micro-hydraulic technology is crucial to the design of micropumps for applications including chemical analysis, biological sensing and robots. We aim at addressing two primary problems for most micro-pumps: low efficiency and high cost miniaturization. First, considering the efficiency of microhydraulic systems, all types of pumps suffer from a low efficiency. For example, piezoelectric-actuated pumps have dominated reciprocating micropump technology because of their fast response time and precise dosage ability. However, this is a low-efficiency pumping mechanism, with efficiencies of around 0.1%. Second, miniaturization comes at a high cost. When mechanical pumps are scaled down to centimeters or millimeters, miniaturization is constrained by manufacturing technologies and pump specifications.\n\nAdvantages: High efficiency pumping enables miniaturization of pumps. Effective use of low shear stress behavior and dynamic response of ER fluid"
MIT,High-Throughput Untranslated Region Engineering andScreening,Case number: #19123,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/high-throughput-untranslated-region-engineering-and,"This technology is a synthetic 5’ UTR sequence that increases recombinant protein expression with applications in research and large-scale enzyme or protein therapeutic production.\n\nTechnology: This technology uses novel synthetic 5’ unranslated regions (UTRs) to increase protein expression. 5’ UTRs are present in all genes and are required for ribosomes, the translation machinery that makes protein, to find, bind to, and begin translating RNA sequences. The ‘strength’ of a gene’s 5’ UTR dictates how much protein is made from that gene’s RNA, and 5’ UTRs from highly expressed genes have long been used in molecular biology applications. These inventors performed an unbiased screen of the 5’ UTRs on highly expressed genes across many cell types, trained a machine-learning algorithm with this data, then used this computational platform to develop efficient synthetic 5’ UTR sequences. The resulting synthetic 5’ UTRs drive higher expression than commonly used natural 5’ UTR sequences, therefore resulting in higher protein expression per cell.\n\nProblem Addressed: Recombinant synthesis techniques are used throughout molecular biology to make proteins for research and therapeutic purposes. To make a protein, DNA is first transcribed into an RNA intermediate, then the RNA is translated into protein. There have been many improvements in boosting the efficiency of the first transcription step of protein expression, but there has thus far been little innovation in boosting translation efficiency from RNA into protein. These inventors developed a novel technique for boosting protein expression in human cells by increasing RNA to protein translation.\n\nAdvantages: Increased protein expression in human cells. Synthetic 5’ UTR drives more efficient translation than natural 5’ UTR sequences"
MIT,"Engineered Phagemids for Non-Lytic, Targeted AntibacterialTechnologies",Case number: #18186HJY,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/engineered-phagemids-non-lytic-targeted-antibacterial,"This technology is a phage-based antibiotic system with potential applications as a therapeutic.\n\nTechnology: This technology uses phagemids to specifically target and kill bacteria. Bacteriophages (phages) are bacteria-specific viruses that infect and lyse specific species and strains of bacteria. Phages were long ago proposed as a potential antibiotic therapy due to their exquisite specificity, however, when phage lyse their host bacteria the bacterial membrane bursts and releases endotoxins that can induce strong inflammatory reactions in patients. This technology uses a modified phage system, called phagemids, which efficiently kill bacteria without lysis and the resulting toxin release. The phagemid system uses two DNA vectors, one that expresses antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and a second that specifically packages the AMP vector. When transformed into a strain of packaging bacteria, these vectors produce large amounts of replication-defective phage that can be purified and used as an antibiotic. This phagemid technology has several important improvements over existing technologies. Firstly, the phagemids are replication-deficient and do not result in propagation of more phage, which eliminates the potential for unregulated phage evolution. Secondly, the non-lytic nature of the phagemids reduces toxicity due to bacterial bursting and reduces the formation of bacteriophage resistance. As a proof of principle, the inventors demonstrated that the AMP phagemids were highly effective in treating a mouse. in vivo. model of. E.coli. peritonitis.\n\nProblem Addressed: Bacterial antibiotic resistance is a major health crisis that results in 23,000 deaths and $55 billion in healthcare expenditures every year in the US alone. The rate of bacterial acquisition of antibiotic resistance outpaces the rate of development of new antibiotics; therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new antibiotic therapies. This technology is a novel, highly effective antibiotic with potential therapeutic applications.\n\nAdvantages: Modular vector system allows rapid customization of phage characteristics and customizable choice of antimicrobial peptides. Non-lytic bacterial killing reduces toxicity. Non-replicative phage eliminates unregulated evolution. Reduces the formation of bacterial resistance. Demonstrated. in vivo. effectiveness in a mouse model of peritonitis"
MIT,Recombinase-Based Genetic DiversificationSchemes,Case number: #18173,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/recombinase-based-genetic-diversification-schemes,"A recombinase-based scheme to create a system that generates its own genetic diversity could be used to create novel antibiotics with minimal labor.\n\nTechnology: This invention comprises biological system that generates its own genetic diversity by taking advantage of shufflon, a site-specific recombination system which consists of four DNA segments and seven separate recombination sites. This system was previously reported as a single piece of DNA that has the ability to recombine to create seven different open reading frames, which means that it codes for seven different combinations of proteins. The shufflon system was adapted to generate biological diversity in the pikromycin pathway, a pathway coding for enzymes that modify antibiotic synthesis. Four genes were selected from three different species of bacteria co-synthesized with shufflon in yeast artificial chromosomes. This system is currently being tested for integration into S. coelicolor bacteria, with the ultimate goal of producing new antibiotics.\n\nProblem Addressed: Currently, common approaches to antibiotic discovery are slow. One must screen for novel bacterial isolates, mix and match genes by traditional cloning, and chemically resynthesize the discovered compounds. A new approach that is less labor-intensive and increases the yield of novel compounds would greatly improve upon current methods.\n\nAdvantages: Hands-free engineering. Maximization of number of possible pathways for antibiotic synthesis. Can undergo multiple rounds of engineering with minimal labor"
MIT,Heterogeneous Organic Gel Catalyst for Photo-ControlledChemistry,Case number: #19049,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/heterogeneous-organic-gel-catalyst-photo-controlled,"Radical polymerization is often used in the design and fabrication of new materials for a variety of applications, including but not limited to coatings, adhesives, and gels used in manufacturing processes.\n\nTechnology: This invention involves a derivative of an organic photocatalyst called 10-phenylphenothiazine (PTH). This derivative is conjugated to a thermally responsive gel to create Gel-PTH in a simple three-step synthesis. When Gel-PTH is swollen in a monomer-containing solution, it provides a transparent framework through which initiators and monomers can diffuse into and begin polymerizing via photo-CRP and heat-responsive reactions. When the Gel-PTH is removed from the solution, when the temperature is increased, or when the light is turned off, the polymerization reaction is effectively turned off. In this way, polymerization is controlled by three separate stimuli—light, heat, and presence of the photocatalyst. The Inventors tested Gel-PTH catalysis using different types of RAFT and ATRP initiators and seven different types of monomers—NIPAAM (N-isopropylacrylamide), DMA (dimethylacrylamide), nBA (n-butyl acrylate), MA (methyl acrylate), EGMEA (ethylene glycol methyl ether acrylate), HEA (2-hydroxyethyl acrylate), and IBA (isobutyl acrylate.) They were able to create at a large variety of polymers with molar masses, ranging from 14.8 kDa to 46.6 kDa, by adjusting the molar ratios of the monomer, initiator, and PTH, by using different solvents, and by increasing or decreasing the time of the reaction. Furthermore, the inventors demonstrated that the Gel-PTH catalyst could be easily recycled and re-used in multiple polymerization reactions with no loss of efficiency.\n\nProblem Addressed: The ability to initiate and control radical polymerization using light (photo-CRP) has been a recent topic of great interest in polymer chemistry. In photo-CRP applications, light can be used to activate a suitable photoredox catalyst, which induces a controlled polymerization reaction that can be terminated by shutting off the light. However, to date, nobody has designed a polymerization reaction that is responsive not only to light, but simultaneously to other types of external stimuli such as heat. Furthermore, readily recyclable photoredox catalysts are limited in scope. This type of multi-stimuli-responsive CRP, which integrates different environmental cues to produce unique polymers, could lead to the production of a much more diverse array of polymers while maintaining low catalyst loadings.\n\nAdvantages: Simple three-step synthesis of Gel-phenothiazine (PTH). Robust switching of photo-CRP reactions in response to temperature, light, and catalyst presence. Wide range of monomers including acrylates, methacrylates, acrylamides, vinyl esters and vinyl amides. New opportunities for stimuli-responsive controlled polymerization. Simple catalyst recyclability"
MIT,Syncells - Artificial Colloidal Folded 2d Electronic State-Machines - Fabrication andApplications,Case number: #19030,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/syncells-artificial-colloidal-folded-2d-electronic,"This technology is a small electronic state machine that has applications in environmental and biological sensing.\n\nTechnology: Syncells are small devices (<100μm) composed of two graphene sheets encapsulating 2D electronics, liquid, gel, and nanoparticles. Each syncell can be functionalized by depositing different molecules on each graphene surface or by encapsulating different particles. This allows diverse functionalization of the syncells. These inventors have described two syncell designs engineered to function as RAM devices or environmental sensors. Firstly, syncells that encapsulate liquid exfoliated black phosphorus nano-flakes in the interior of the syncell can function as RAM devices. These syncells create a duo-electrode system that can sense voltages and store the memory of that voltage. A single syncell can store multiple bits of information, and therefore function as a sub-millimeter RAM device. In a second example of syncell design, the inventors engineered MoS2 syncells to function as an aerosolizable environmental sensor. MoS2 changes conductive properties upon adsorption of particular molecules, therefore, MoS2 syncells function as miniature electronic sensors. The inventors describe successful detection of trimethylamine droplets and ammonia gas in the environment through aerosolization and subsequent electronic readout of the syncells. Importantly, syncells are very mechanically and chemically stable, and are able to withstand aerosolization, shear stress, and corrosive environments.\n\nProblem Addressed: Miniaturized robots have long been sought after as a way of performing tasks in places no human could physically fit or survive, such as inside the human body or in an oil well. The major barrier to realizing micro-bots has been designing electronic circuits on the micrometer scale. These inventors have engineered sub-millimeter sized programmable state machines, called syncells, that are capable of functioning as ram access memory (RAM) devices and aerosolizable electronic sensing devices.\n\nAdvantages: Small (<100μm) electronic devices. Multiple bit RAM storage on a single syncell. Aerosolizable environmental sensing with electronic readout. Diverse functionalization through molecule encapsulation or deposition on graphene surfaces. Mechanically and chemically stable"
MIT,Faster Streaming Algorithms for Deterministic Low-Rank MatrixApproximations,Case number: #18172J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/faster-streaming-algorithms-deterministic-low-rank,"The Inventors have developed low-rank matrix approximation algorithms, designed for approximating large dimensionality, streaming, potentially distributed data in the matrix format, with fixed memory footprint. This technology can be used for a variety of applications that utilize the collection and analysis of extremely large data sets; for example, it can be used for tasks in image analysis or text-processing to reduce the required time and computation cost of such problems.\n\nTechnology: This invention is an expansion of recently discovered matrix sketching technique. The first algorithm, Incremental Frequent Directions has a running time of. O. (. nml. ) and is based on an algorithm called Frequent Directions II that has a running time of. O. (. nml2. ). It replaces the full SVD step in Frequent Directions II with a rank-one SVD update. The second algorithm, named Truncated Incremental Frequent Directions II, is a form of incremental frequent directions, with lower running time in trade of the precision for. O. (. nl3. ). The third algorithm, Truncated Incremental Frequent Directions, uses the same idea from Truncated Incremental Frequent Directions II to Frequent Directions; instead of performing the truncated SVD update for each row of matrix A, it does a batch computation with ½ rows each iteration. This algorithm works with. O. (. nml. ).\n\nProblem Addressed: Other low-rank matrix approximation algorithms that perform SVD/rank-. k. SVD on a nxm matrix A (n>>m) require a O(nm. 2. ) runtime and O(nm) run space to compute SVD, which can be infeasible requirements for large matrices. The algorithms the Inventors discover do not require saving all existing data in the past. Instead, given a low-rank approximation of existing data, they update approximation on new data without recursively recomputing SVD on the entire dataset, saving storage and computational cost.\n\nAdvantages: Inventors’ algorithm demonstrates faster runtime than other existing methods. Algorithm also demonstrates empirically lower relative error rate than other methods"
MIT,Liquid Biopsy Detection of Minimal Residual Disease in Leukemia Using Closed-LoopMicrofluidics,Case number: #18989DE,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/liquid-biopsy-detection-minimal-residual-disease,"This technology is a closed-loop microfluidic system that enriches for leukemic blast cells from blood with applications in the medical field for the detection of minimal residual disease in leukemia patients.\n\nTechnology: Using an inertial focusing approach, this technology detects rare leukemic blast cells from blood samples. A patient’s blood sample is first collected, and red blood cells are lysed. The sample is then loaded into the inlet reservoir of a microfluidic biochip. Here, a net force that is comprised of net internal lift force and dean drag force is exerted onto the blood sample in a closed-loop spiral microchannel. Non-target cells, such as white blood cells, encounter a different net force than blast cells, which have a higher nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. The differential net force allows distinct cell types to form separate focused streams within the microchannel. Strategically placed bifurcation points within the microchannel enable the sorting of cells undergoing differential net forces into separate outlet reservoirs. The isolated blast cells can then be further evaluated by flow cytometry and histopathology.\n\nProblem Addressed: The non-invasive detection of leukemia could enable clinicians both to treat this disease earlier in its development and to monitor residual disease, thus improving overall prognosis of leukemia patients. Leukemia can be detected most directly by collecting a biopsy of the patient’s bone marrow. However, this surgical procedure is expensive and invasive, and is unsuitable for the long-term management of leukemia. A non-invasive alternative to bone marrow biopsy would involve sampling the patient’s blood to detect myeloid blast cells, which are leukemia cells that have been released from the bone marrow and have entered the circulatory system. Unfortunately, existing methods such as flow cytometry are not sensitive enough to detect rare blast cells in patients that have minimal residual disease. For leukemia patients with minimal residual disease, an effective non-invasive method to detect rare blast cells in the blood could prevent cancer relapse and improve quality of life.\n\nAdvantages: Non-invasive technique enables routine monitoring of leukemia. Significantly less expensive and faster than bone marrow biopsy with no mortality risk. No need for antibody labeling to isolate cancer cells"
MIT,Electrochemical Reaction and System for Conversion of SulfurHexafluoride,Case number: #18986,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/electrochemical-reaction-and-system-conversion-sulfur,"This invention enables the electrochemical reduction and conversion of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) into solid, gaseous, and/or dissolved gas products in a non-aqueous environment.  Sulfur hexafluoride can be completely destroyed through interaction with an alkali metal, such as lithium, to yield high discharge capacities. As a result, this technology is suitable for greenhouse gas mitigation and electrochemical power applications.\n\nTechnology: This invention establishes candidate electrolytes in which sulfur hexafluoride may be dissolved to permit electrochemical reactivity and battery development. Solubility of sulfur hexafluoride in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) is comparable to the solubility of 1-10 mM oxygen gas in various nonaqueous electrolytes for lithium-oxygen batteries, thereby facilitating electrochemical reduction of sulfur hexafluoride. Lithium-sulfur-hexafluoride cells are constructed using a pre-stabilized lithium metal anode, a Vulcan carbon cathode, and non-aqueous battery electrolyte such as lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) in TEGDME. The resulting lithium-sulfur-hexafluoride cell exhibits significantly higher discharge capacities of up to ~2500 mAh/gcarbon at 5mA/gcarbon  compared to Li cells discharged under argon (<30 mAh/gcarbon).\n\nProblem Addressed: Maturation of commercialized primary lithium-based batteries like lithium-thionyl chloride and lithium-carbon monofluoride has ultimately led to the tapering off of energy density gains in recent years. This invention utilizes the reaction and destruction of sulfur hexafluoride, a non-reactive greenhouse gas which has been difficult to activate with current chemistry methods, to increase the discharge capacities of lithium batteries. As a result, it addresses two challenges, (1) the capture and destruction of a greenhouse gas, and (2) the increase of lithium battery energy-density.\n\nAdvantages: Electrochemically reducing conditions, rather than high temperatures, drive molecular activation and reaction of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) at room temperature with high yields.

MIT,Novel Peptidic Agents for Targeting Chemoresistant Anti-ApoptoticMcl-1,Case number: #18162,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/novel-peptidic-agents-targeting-chemoresistant-anti-0,"Mcl-1-binding peptides may be useful in treating a variety of chemotherapy-resistant cancers such as adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\n\nTechnology: Mcl-1, along with other members of the Bcl-2 family, blocks apoptosis by binding to short helices in pro-apoptotic proteins, inhibiting their homo-oligomerization and activation. Synthetic peptides that bind Mcl-1 can be used to prevent this interaction by physically blocking the binding site on Mcl-1 and preventing its inhibition of pro-apoptotic proteins. This has been demonstrated using the short peptide MS1, which binds Mcl-1 and selectively induces mitochondrial permeabilization (MOMP) in Mcl-1-dependent cancer cells.  This process has been improved upon with the use of hydrocarbon stapling to stabilize the peptide and promote its cellular uptake. Concurrently, a peptide library screen revealed two sequence modifications of MS1— each a substitution of an amino acid residue— that enhance binding to Mcl-1 without compromising a high degree of specificity or requiring hydrocarbon stapling for their activity. However, these high-affinity peptides still require a means for cell entry (e.g., nanoparticle delivery). In combination with a delivery system, the optimized peptides have therapeutic potential as highly selective Mcl-1 inhibitors.\n\nProblem Addressed: Mcl-1 is an oncogene that is overexpressed in many cancers and confers resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Mcl-1 belongs to a family of anti-apoptotic proteins with homology to B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Inhibition of Mcl-1 and related proteins using potent, selectively binding small molecules is a promising avenue for therapy; however, no such small molecule has been identified for Mcl-1. Synthetic peptides designed to selectively inhibit Mcl-1 are an alternative to small molecules. Upon delivery into the cell, the peptides bind and inhibit Mcl-1, making them candidates for development as cancer therapeutics.\n\nAdvantages: High binding affinity. Mcl-1 specific binding"
MIT,Thermoplastic Elastomers and Gels Based on Subcomponent MetallosupramolecularAssembly,Case number: #18923,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/thermoplastic-elastomers-and-gels-based-subcomponent,"This technology is an advancement in elastomer engineering that has applications in improving the mechanical properties of rubbery networks while at the same time imbuing them with nanoporous features that could be leveraged for gas separations, water purification, or catalysis.\n\nTechnology: This technology is a hybrid of two established nanomaterial technologies: di-block copolymers (BCP), and metal organic nanostructures (MONs). These combined block co-polymer-(MON) conjugates (BCPMONs) feature unique hierarchical structures, and the physical properties of the resulting thermoplastic elastomers or gels can be precisely tuned by combining different MON or BCP structures. The BCPMONS can be assembled in a two-step process. Firstly, the BCP polymer arms are assembled around MON cores to yield star polymers with a defined number of arms. Secondly, the star polymers undergo physical cross-linking between the BCP polymer arms to yield a polymer with a complex network of both amorphous polymer and well-defined MON junctions. The diverse MON and BCP structures already available mean that this technology provides tremendous opportunities to develop new BCPMONs with novel properties.\n\nProblem Addressed: Most polymeric materials are either non-porous or non-flexible/elastic. Elastomers that also feature nanoscale porosity would open new avenues for the design of processable and elastic rubbers that that also have porosity. Currently, these two features (elasticity/toughness and porosity) are typically inversely related. This technology provides a new synthesis technique for materials that enables the introduction of nano-scale porosity into tough elastomers.\n\nAdvantages: Tunable viscoelastic properties and porosity within the same material. Variety of novel materials by using the multitude of existing BCP and MON compounds. Thermoplastic behavior. Greater storage life over conventional metal-organic polyhedral and frameworks"
MIT,Method to TreatAmblyopia,Case number: #18125PH,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/method-treat-amblyopia,"The purpose of this technology is to provide a treatment for amblyopia that promotes full recovery of normal visual ability in both eyes for patients of all ages.\n\nTechnology: This invention presents a novel approach to effectively treat amblyopia by harnessing metaplasticity to promote recovery of vision. The method involves silencing activity in both retinas using a local anesthetic, in this case, tetrodotoxin. Tetrodotoxin can be delivered through intraocular injections. Upon the completion of treatment with the anesthetic, normal visual acuity quickly develops. Therefore, the inventors have demonstrated that a single binocular injection of the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin, which silences the retinas for approximately 2-3 days, is sufficient to enable recovery from monocular deprivation in animals.\n\nProblem Addressed: Amblyopia is a widespread and severe form of visual disability that originates in childhood and persists into adulthood. Currently, the primary treatment for amblyopia involves patching or blurring the vision in the stronger eye. However, this treatment is ineffective beyond 10 years of age, is hampered by poor compliance, and does not promote recovery of binocular vision. The technology described has proven effective in both juvenile and adult animals, and provides a treatment strategy that circumvents compliance issues. Meanwhile, it maintains the primary advantage of the current treatment in that it is a minimally invasive strategy for treating a brain disorder.\n\nAdvantages: Recovery is possible at an older age compared to treatment using traditional reverse occlusion. Provides 100% complete recovery. Recovery of the weak eye does not come at the expense of the stronger eye"
MIT,Method to Distinguish and Analyze White Blood Cells in the Presence of Red Blood Cells,Case number: #18889,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/method-distinguish-and-analyze-white-blood-cells,"This technology utilizes scatter illumination techniques to distinguish between red blood cells and white blood cells without the need to lyse the cells. This would allow researchers and clinicians to more accurately analyze and count white blood cells, improving diagnostic insight into a patient’s immune system. It would be especially helpful for patients who have health conditions that make their red blood cells resistant to lysing, such as liver disease, sickle cell anemia, those undergoing chemotherapy, and newborns.\nThis technology may also extend to the analysis of other circulating cells including tumor cells, epithelial cells, and cancer stem cells.\n\nTechnology: This method for white blood cell analysis distinguishes between blood cell types by using side scatter. It illuminates a blood sample from multiple angles and analyzes the light interaction with each cell. When light interacts with a cell, the deflection angle can be used to measure the internal features of a cell. The reflected light from white blood cells is directionally dependent (anisotropic) while the reflected light from white blood cells in uniform in all orientations (isotropic). This technology can be added to an image-based cytometer or hematology analyzer that uses high or low resolution microscopy.\n\nProblem Addressed: It is easy to mistake red blood cells for white blood cells. Clinicians and researchers must lyse red blood cells from a sample of blood in order analyze and count the white blood cells that remain. Red blood cell lysing techniques can result in the incomplete lysis of red blood cells. Additionally, a large population of patients have hard-to-lyse red blood cells. Existing solutions for hard-to-lyse samples either adversely alter the cells via chemical fixation or require the use of dyes. There is a need for a technique, such as this, that is capable of helping researchers and clinicians more effectively identify white blood cells in the presence of red blood cells without lysing red blood cells, without altering cells, and without dyes.\n\nAdvantages: Analyze and count white blood cells without lysing red blood cells. Analyze hard-to-lyse blood samples with a high degree of accuracy. No need for dyes or cell-altering fixation chemicals. Low-cost optical instrumentation"
MIT,Efficiency Maximization for Device-to-Device WirelessCharging,Case number: #18112,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/efficiency-maximization-device-device-wireless,"Applications for this technology include small wireless devices such as smart watches, Bluetooth headsets and mp3 players.\n\nTechnology: This invention presents a method for efficiently charging small electronics from larger devices such as a cell phone. The technology requires a transmission chip to be inserted into the larger device, as well as a receiver chip to be inserted into the small device. Once the devices are within each other’s proximity, the chips automatically detect each other’s presence and initiate the charging routine. A resonant rectifier design enables receiver-side energy management and allows automatic optimization of the energy transmission based upon the particular battery parameters and charge state of the small device’s battery. This system continues to optimize the transmission flow rate as the small device’s battery charges. Once fully charged, the larger device automatically ends energy transmission saving energy and allowing for more recharging cycles.\n\nProblem Addressed: Modern developments in wearable electronics have resulted in minimized device sizes with greater functionality requirements. Because of minimal increases in battery life development, efficient methods of wireless battery charging is requisite. This technology presents an optimized wireless charging system, which reduces energy waste, thereby optimizing the user experience.\n\nAdvantages: Receiver-side energy management ensures consistent high efficiency wireless charging. Auto-detection of receiver eliminates wasteful energy transmissions. Minimal ionizing radiation makes this technology ideal for personal devices. Simple design assures reliability and low implementation costs"
MIT,High-Frequency Variable Load InverterArchitecture,Case number: #18879,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/high-frequency-variable-load-inverter-architecture,"High-frequency inverters are used in industrial plasma generators as well as in wireless power transfer which utilize signals having frequencies within industrial, scientific, and medical bandwidths.\n\nTechnology: The invented high-frequency inverter system enables HF power delivery directly into highly variable impedance loads with a relatively high efficiency. A pair of inverters are coupled and controlled such that each inverter is connected to a load with resistive and inductive characteristics. This configuration limits any parasitic inductances while realizing zero-voltage switching. The invented system includes a first inverter directly connected to the variable impedance load and a second inverter coupled to the load through an immittance converter. Control signals come from a coupled controller to the first and second inverters to yield capacitance in the second inverter and inductance in the first inverter. This maintains resistive and inductive loading of the constituent inverters for zero-voltage soft switching.\n\nProblem Addressed: High-frequency (HF) power is usually coupled to a load that exhibits load impedances over a wide range. Inverter designs at HF generally use fundamental frequency inductive loading to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS) transitions, which are necessary to achieve high efficiency operation. Providing HF power to a load having a highly-variable load impedance makes it difficult to maintain desired inductive loading without requiring a large inductive circulating current, which can induce substantial loss. To address load impedance variations, some inverters are augmented with a tunable matching network (TMN) that dynamically matches the variable load impedance to the fixed value desired for the inverter. Though effective, the TMN itself is expensive, bulky, slow, and inefficient. Thus, efficient generation and delivery of power into variable load impedances is difficult, resulting in HF inverter systems that are bulky, expensive, and inefficient.\n\nAdvantages: Delivers a specified output power while preserving desired inverter loading characteristics. More efficient, faster and less expensive than a tunable matching network"
MIT,Electromechanical Lysis of Bacterial Pathogens using Ion ConcentrationPolarization,Case number: #19035,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/electromechanical-lysis-bacterial-pathogens-using-ion,"This bacterial lysis mechanism generates ICP near the ion selective membranes of the bacteria to shear and electrically permeate the bacteria. This enables the use of low voltage electric fields (100-300 V/cm) in common buffers such as phosphate to lyse the bacteria. This technique facilitates the recovery of intracellular biomaterials such as proteins and RNA’s from both easy-to-lyse and hard-to-lyse bacteria that previously required low salinity solutions and extremely high electric fields (4000-8000 V/cm). This technology can be adjusted to lyse bacteria at large scales by combining multiple lysis mechanisms into a laterally-arrayed electromechanical lysis device.\n\nProblem Addressed: Electrical cell permeation is currently the preferred lysis technique. It is a simple process without lytic additives, enabling prompt lysis of cells. However, electrical cell permeation requires high voltage electric fields that often result in intracellular biomolecule degradation, bacterial sample overheating, and undesirable bubble generation. Non-optimal low voltage levels and low-salinity solutions must be used to compensate for these impediments. This produces incomplete lysis and lower throughput. This electromechanical lysis invention enables the rapid, continuous, versatile, and high-throughput lysis of various bacterial pathogens by applying a very low voltage.\n\nAdvantages: Low-voltage lysing technique facilitates harvesting of intracellular biomaterials. Can be used at large scales for water treatment. Enables continuous, high-throughput lysis of bacteria"
MIT,Efficient Smith-Purcell Radiation Sources and EnhancementMethods,Case number: #19456,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/efficient-smith-purcell-radiation-sources-and,"This light emitting technology improves upon the Smith-Purcell Effect by implementing a dielectric periodic structure. The light source shows promise in a range of Ultraviolet (UV), Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV), and soft X-ray applications, such as UV sterilization and forensics, EUV lithography, and soft X-ray tomography.\n\nTechnology: This wavelength-tunable light emission technology enhances the monochromatic and directional nature of Smith-Purcell radiation through a dielectric periodic structure. The electron source comprises of a laser that illuminates a gated field emitter array (FEA) with light pulses, propagating free electrons as a beam. The dielectric periodic structure, situated a few wavelengths away from the electron source, interacts with the free electron beam, inducing Smith-Purcell radiation. The periodic structure defines at least one light wave that gets emitted. The technology’s light emission wavelength can be specified between the visible and X-ray range by tuning the electron source’s energy within a range of 0.5 to 40 keV.\n\nProblem Addressed: The Smith-Purcell Effect is a light emission method induced by free electrons coupled to the electromagnetic modes of a periodic structure that diffracts light into several wavelengths. The wavelength of radiation is dependent on the velocity of the free electrons and the geometry of the periodic structure. Smith-Purcell light sources typically use a metallic periodic structure and adjust emission wavelength through electron velocity. Unfortunately, the output of conventional light sources is too weak for realistic application due to a range of nanoscale technical issues, from phase mismatch between electrons and emitted photons to misalignment of the electron beam and the periodic structure.\n\nAdvantages: Enhances monochromatic and directional nature of Smith-Purcell radiation through dielectric periodic structure. Tunable emission wavelength between the visible and X-ray spectrum via FEA-based electron source. Improves output strength, allowing for realistic applications in UV, EUV, and soft X-ray technologies"
MIT,Atherofluidics-on-Chip,Case number: #18096,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/atherofluidics-chip,"Atherofluidics-on-Chip can be used to dynamically apply controlled spatio-temporal atheroprotective and atheroprone flow signatures to endothelial cells cultured for vascular diseases research.\n\nTechnology: This invention, termed ‘atherofluidics-on-chip,’ consists of a microfluidic chip that can dynamically apply controlled and more relevant spatio-temporal atheroprone and atheroprotective flow patterns to endothelial cells. in vitro. . It contains atheroprotective and atheroprone regions that can be activated via valves on the chip and can simultaneously apply high shear flow and oscillatory low-shear flow to cells in different compartments. The cells growing in the same monolayer can be exposed to atheroprotective and atheroprone flows in different regions and can be recovered selectively through a channel after the experiment is concluded. Valves on the chip allow for one to dynamically control parameters of the fluid flow pattern, such as its waveform and oscillatory shear index. These valves adjust the flow rate from a flow source, so they rely on an outside power to generate high levels of shear stress. Preliminary results using this technology have confirmed the chip’s ability to generate multiple unique flow profiles and control shear stress and oscillatory shear indices in branches of the device.\n\nProblem Addressed: Many. in vitro. platforms such as cone-plate viscometers, parallel plate flow chambers, and vertical step flow devices, have been used to apply different hemodynamic flow patterns to primary human epithelial cells growing in fluid to model cardiovascular pathologies, since flow patterns are highly prognostic of diseases such as atherosclerosis. These platforms are usually used to screen for drugs that treat these diseases and are advantageous to. in vivo. models in that they allow for human cells to be studied directly. However, current. in vitro. systems cannot replicate the complex flow profiles that exist. in vivo. . In addition, they usually only allow for a single fluidic condition to be analyzed per experiment. A new device that offers high throughput and a modelling of more complex spatio-temporal flow patterns would greatly improve upon current devices.\n\nAdvantages: Novel solution to study vascular-like flows directly on human cells. Unique customization of atheroprotective and atheroprone flow profiles. Inexpensive experimentation due to lower reagent costs and the ability to run parallel experiments at once. Ability to monitor cells in real time and recover cells from specific flow regions"
MIT,PNA Amphiphile Adjuvant DeliveryVehicles,Case number: #18878H,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/pna-amphiphile-adjuvant-delivery-vehicles,"The current invention of synthetic nanoparticle carrying cyclic dinucleotide (CDN), an immunomodulatory compound, can be used to induce or enhance immune responses with the potential use as adjuvant for vaccines. It can also be used to elicit an immune response against cancer or bacterial infections.\n\nTechnology: This invention uses PNA oligomer as a carrier of CDN, where they form reversible noncovalent complexes through pi-pi base stacking and hydrogen-bond interactions. The PNA oligomer is covalently conjugated to an amphiphile such as diacyl lipid tail, and optionally may include a polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule. The arrangement of the lipid tail and PEG molecule allows for modulation of size and structure of the synthetic nanoparticle to control CDN delivery based on the desired response.\n\nProblem Addressed: The role of CDN as an immunomodulatory compound has been demonstrated for a while; however, its use has been limited due to poor pharmacokinetics. Injected CDN is rapidly flushed from the site of injection, leading to systemic inflammation. Thus, there is a need for CDN delivery methods that retain the compound at the site of injection. The current invention utilizes synthetic nanoparticles formed by mixing CDN with peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-amphiphile conjugate to increase retention at the site of injection and avoid systemic inflammatory effects.\n\nAdvantages: PNA-amphiphile conjugate acts as a modulatable carrier of CDN to control delivery and reduce systemic inflammatory effects."

Hydrogel engineering has thus far been limited by the tunability of covalently linked hydrogels, and there remains a need for hydrogels with improved strength, unique viscoelastic properties, and stimuli responsiveness. These inventors describe a set of metal crosslinked hydrogels that have tunable viscoelastic properties and can additionally switch properties upon exposure to UV light.\n\nAdvantages: UV inducible switching of viscoelastic properties. “Designer” hydrogels with precise characteristics and UV responses"
MIT,Self-Sealing Sample TransferBox,Case number: #18858,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/self-sealing-sample-transfer-box,"This invention has application to research and commercial entities that use scanning electron microscopes (SEMs), focused ion beams (FIBs), glove-boxes, or other vacuum based instruments for studying battery materials, semiconductor processing, or nanomaterials.\n\nTechnology: This invention uses a flexural bearing mechanism that allows for effective transport of samples between equipment without exposure to air. The design for the Sample Transfer Flexure Box (STFB) employs a double-acting piston opposed by an array of 4 parallel 3-stage blade flexures. This flexure design model enables the system to reseal itself for operation under vacuum conditions with minimal parasitic loading after repeatable motion.\n\nAdvantages: Compatible with different instruments such as a FIB or SEM.

MIT,"M13 Phage Assembly System for Optimal Blood Trafficking, Tumor Penetration, and Passage Across the Blood BrainBarrier",Case number: #19438,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/m13-phage-assembly-system-optimal-blood-trafficking,"This technology is a method of delivering therapeutic and imaging molecules across the blood brain barrier with applications in the imaging and treatment of neuroectodermal tumors such as glioblastoma.\n\nTechnology: This technology is a novel method of delivering therapeutics and imaging molecules to the brain using the filamentous bacteriophage M13. M13 phage are an attractive candidate for a molecular courier due to their small diameter (~5-6nm), rod-like shape, and the ability to modify coat proteins to attach functional molecules. These inventors made two major improvements to M13 phage to increase BBB penetration and GBM targeting. Firstly, they decreased the length of the phage. M13 phage length is directly proportional to the size of the packaged genome, so these inventors devised a two-plasmid system to decrease the size of the packaged ssDNA genome. One plasmid contains all of the coding information for the protein coat and packaging components, and the second contains only ssDNA of tunable length containing a packaging signal. By changing the size of the plasmid with the packaging signal, the length of the M13 phage can be finely tuned between 880nm for a wild type phage down to only 50nm for phage with a packaged genome of 285 DNA base pairs. Secondly, the inventors included a chlorotoxin (CTX) motif on the M13 phage. CTX has a high positive charge that aids in BBB penetration and has additionally been shown to target very specifically to the electronegative GBM extracellular matrix. The combined M13-CTX delivery system results in highly efficient BBB penetration and GBM targeting while additionally facilitating addition of therapeutic or imaging molecules to the M13 coat proteins. As a proof of principle, the inventors attached single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) to the M13-CTX phage and injected the composition into an. in vivo. mouse model of GBM. The SWNT-M13-CTX phage demonstrated efficient tumor targeting and facilitated sub-millimeter resolution near infrared imaging.\n\nProblem Addressed: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common cancer of the brain. GBM is very fast growing and is considered one of the most lethal cancers, with a 5-year survival rate of only 5%. One of the major challenges in treating GBM is finding drugs that can cross the blood brain barrier (BBB), which is composed of very tight junctions in the blood vessel walls of the brain. These tight junctions are so restrictive that they prevent most small molecule drugs from reaching the brain, and 98% of all small molecule drugs are incapable of penetrating this barrier. These inventors have developed a novel strategy to use M13 bacteriophage as a courier to deliver therapeutics and imaging molecules across the BBB.\n\nAdvantages: Improved M13 phage blood brain barrier penetration. Specific targeting of M13 to GBM tumors. Therapeutic or imaging molecule delivery through conjugation to M13-CTX phage. Rod-like shape improves extravasation, immune cell escape, and internalization by cancer cells in comparison to traditional nanoparticles.

In addition, this invention allows for the identification of subjects at risk of developing obesity or disorders mediated by a dysregulation of the energy consumption pathway.\n\nProblem Addressed: Obesity affects more than 500 million people worldwide and is one of the leading contributors to common and severe disorders, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Considerable efforts have been made to define its causal mechanisms, as understanding the genetic cause of obesity could illuminate the causal genetic mechanism of other disorders. The fat mass and obesity- associated (FTO) locus has been shown to possess the strongest association with obesity risk. Despite considerable efforts to define causal mechanisms, the functional variant remains uncharacterized among 82 highly-associated single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and the molecular and cellular intermediate phenotypes, mechanisms, and biological processes leading to obesity remain unknown.\n\nAdvantages: Direct targeting of the fat mass and obesity- associated (FTO) locus genetic variant, rs 1421085. Diagnosis tool for subjects at risk of developing obesity or with a dysregulation of the energy consumption pathway.

For example, if the model is given an utterance containing spoken instances of the words “lighthouse,” it can associate it with images containing lighthouses. This technique is relevant to many applications in spoken language processing.\n\nTechnology: The Inventors train a deep multimodal embedding network with a vast repository of spoken captions and image data to map entire image frames and entire spoken captions into a shared embedding space. The trained network can then be used to localize patterns corresponding to words and phrases within a spectrogram, which is a visual representation of the spoken caption’s spectrum of frequencies, as well as visual objects within the image by applying it to small sub-regions of the image and spectrogram. The model is comprised of two branches, one which takes as an input images and the other which takes as input spectrograms.\n\nProblem Addressed: Humans are capable of discovering words and other elements of linguistic structure in continuous speech at a very early age, a process proven difficult for computers to emulate. It is inherently a joint segmentation and clustering problem, made difficult by many sources of variability. While conventional, supervised automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have recently made strides due to deep neural networks (DNNs), their application is limited as they require vast amounts of costly text transcription. The Inventors’ method of acoustic pattern discovery can discover word and phrase categories from continuous speech at the raw signal level with no transcriptions or conventional speech recognition, and jointly learn the semantics of those categories via visual associations. The method of acoustic pattern discovery runs in linear time, vastly superior to previous efforts.\n\nAdvantages: Our Team. Join Our Mailing List. Contact. FAQs. Accessibility. Sustainability.

MIT,Multiplexed Specific Metalloprotease ActivityMeasurements,Case number: #19425DE,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/multiplexed-specific-metalloprotease-activity,"This technology is a method of detecting active metalloproteases in biological samples, and has potential applications as a research tool, drug discovery technique, or diagnostic.\n\nTechnology: This technology detects active MMPs using a multifunctional probe that binds selectively to the active form of many MMPs and facilitates conjugation to a fluorescent tag through a biotin functional group. The identity of probe-bound MMPs can be detected with commercially available, color-coded beads conjugated to antibodies against specific MMPs. Quantification of the fluorescence from both the probe and beads are then compared to standards of known concentration and used to very accurately determine the concentration of the individual constituent MMPs. The inventors demonstrate that this technology works on samples from cell culture supernatant, menstrual fluid, and peritoneal fluid. Additionally, MMP detection is both sensitive and specific and can accurately detect MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -9, -10, and -12 at concentrations as low as 100 molecules per microliter of sample. Finally, this technology is can easily be multiplexed, and is compatible with high-throughput screening techniques.\n\nProblem Addressed: Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are enzymatic proteins that are important for many physiological roles in development and adulthood. MMPs are an attractive diagnostic and therapeutic target because MMP expression and activity is dysregulated in many diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, endometriosis, pre-eclampsia, and arthritis. However, detection of MMP activity remains a challenge. Current technologies often fail to differentiate between active and inactive forms, require large sample sizes, and only detect single MMPs at a time. This technology is a simple, multiplexed solution to detect MMP activity.\n\nAdvantages: Accurate MMP detection with small sample input (as little as 1 µL). Multiplexed, simultaneous detection of MMPs. Highly sensitive and specific. Can detect as low as 100 attomoles analyte. Simple system using many commercially available reagents.

Faster and chemically cleaner than existing transfer methods, this technology may support applications including photovoltaics, semiconductors, batteries, composites, filtration membranes, wearable devices and ultrathin, and flexible electronics.\n\nTechnology: This invention describes systems, devices, and related methods for electromechanical transfer printing of 2D materials disposed on one substrate to another. The printing device can be configured to transfer a 2D material from a source substrate to the target substrate by applying a combination of mechanical and electrostatic forces to facilitate electromechanical adhesion between the 2D material layer and the target substrate. Some embodiments of the printing device can affect direct transfer printing of a 2D material from a source substrate to a target substrate without the use of etchants and adhesives. Some embodiments can include the use of pre-oxidation of the first substrate, a heating element on the second substrate or an applied electric field across either substrate.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current fabrication by chemical vapor deposition on metallic foils is incompatible with polymer or dielectric substrates, thus limiting the applications for this method. Further, other transfer methods rely on wet chemistry or adhesives that can result in defects, unintentional doping, and wasted growth substrate. This transfer process also addresses the need for scalability in size and manufacturing speed, further facilitating research in the effective transfer printing of 2D materials.\n\nAdvantages: No use of metal etchant or adhesives.

MIT,"Open-Ended, Dicer-Cleavable Concatemeric siRNA Generated by Rolling CircleTranscription",Case number: #18076,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/open-ended-dicer-cleavable-concatemeric-sirna,"This invention reduces dosages and improves efficacy of RNA interference drugs including cancer therapeutics.\n\nTechnology: This designed p-shRNA before cleavage is generated from a dumbbell DNA template consisting of a 21 to 29 base pair region encoding a siRNA sequence, with one single stranded loop containing one or more guanosine residues, and the other loop containing no guanosine residues. The p-shRNA is then treated with RNase T1 which specifically cleaves single stranded RNA at the 3’ ends of guanosine residues, to produce siRNA repeats connected by single stranded linkers at one end, with the other end accessible for efficient Dicer cleavage. The inventors have shown that this Dicer-cleavable p-shRNA demonstrates much greater silencing activity than unmodified p-shRNA in GFP-expressing HeLa cells, as well as significant reporter gene knockdown in SKOV3 and UCI101 ovarian cancer cells. This p-shRNA’s greater molecular weight and flexibility compared to siRNA can potentially allow more stable complexation using less delivery materials making it ideal for optimizing gene delivery vehicles.\n\nProblem Addressed: Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have great therapeutic potential but clinical translation has been hindered by poor in vivo stability, low loading efficiency, and dose-limiting toxicity. The generation of periodic short hairpin RNA (concatemeric siRNA) via rolling circle transcription (RCT) of a dumbbell shaped DNA template, which may be processed by Dicer proteins into siRNAs, has been reported as an alternative source of RNA interference. However, due to a lack of open ends, Dicer cleavage of periodic short hairpin RNA (p-shRNA) is inefficient. This invention is a more stable, cleavable p-shRNA containing open ends for efficient Dicer processing enabling high silencing efficacy with smaller amounts of delivery materials.\n\nAdvantages: Improves efficacy of RNA inference drugs while allowing for reduced dosage amounts and frequencies"
MIT,Development of Multi-Specific Antibody-Serum Albumin Fusion Proteins Targeting Multiple Human and Murine CXC (ELR+)Chemokines,Case number: #19355JQ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/development-multi-specific-antibody-serum-albumin,"This technology is an antibody-based therapeutic for rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nTechnology: This technology uses an antibody that promiscuously binds multiple CXC chemokines to block the CXC inflammatory cascades associated with RA. A panel of promiscuous antibodies was developed through three sequential rounds of PCR-mutagenesis and directed evolution by selecting for antibodies with both promiscuous binding tendencies (binding to multiple CXCLs), and high binding affinity against multiple CXCLs. The antibodies were then fused to the serum albumin protein, which stabilizes the antibody in circulation and increases the. in vivo. half-life. The top three antibody hits from this directed evolution scheme blocked receptor activation in response to 2-5 different CXC ligands. in vitro. . Additionally, the inventors performed proof of concept experiments in an. in vivo. mouse model of RA that demonstrated a complete resolution of RA disease burden in only 10 days in response to the top candidate antibody.\n\nProblem Addressed: Chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are very challenging to treat due to the numerous inflammatory ligands and receptors that participate in the inflammatory cascades that lead to disease. For example, in RA, the CXC chemokine system has multiple ligands and receptors that collectively contribute to an inflammatory response. There has been significant research attempting to block CXC-family receptors (CXCRs) or ligands (CXCLs) using antibodies, small molecules, or peptide inhibitors, however, these have not proven successful due to the CXC-family’s tremendous ligand and receptor redundancy. These inventors developed a new method to target multiple CXC ligands simultaneously, which greatly boosts the. in vitro. and. in vivo. inhibition of the CXC inflammatory response.\n\nAdvantages: Promiscuous antibodies allow targeting of multiple CXC ligands with a single antibody formulation. Highly specific to CXC family ligands. Effectively reversed disease in a mouse. in vivo. rheumatoid arthritis model. Potential to translate to other diseases with CXC chemokine dysregulation such as irritable bowel disease and cancer"
MIT,Engineered Yeast As a Method forBioremediation,Case number: #18804,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/engineered-yeast-method-bioremediation,"This technology is an engineered yeast bioremediation tool that has potential uses in environmental cleanup and mining.\n\nTechnology: These inventors have developed three techniques to remove heavy metal waste including cell surface display of metal binding proteins, cellular uptake to capture metals, and biomineralization. The first technique uses a secreted fusion protein of glutamine synthetase (GS) and metallothioneins (MT). GS has a unique ability to form complex scaffolds in the presence of divalent metals. Metallothioneins are plant-based proteins that have specific metal binding capacities. When these proteins are secreted as a fusion protein along with yeast expressing surface displayed GS, they efficiently bind heavy metals in solution and form dense yeast-metal aggregates that are easily removed from the water. The second metal remediation strategy uses direct metal uptake into the yeast using transmembrane metal transporters. These inventors performed successive rounds of mutagenesis and selection on the yeast metal transporter SMF1 and successfully generated SMF1 transporters that specifically and efficiently uptake cadmium, lead, and strontium. The final bioremediation technique these inventors use is biomineralization of metals. Sulfur is a reactive element that can react with metal ions to form inert metal sulfides. Sulfur has been used in industrial chemical precipitation; however, the volatility of sulfur makes it hazardous to store. Sulfur is a necessary element for life, and biochemical sulfur assimilatory pathways are required to make sulfurous amino acids. These inventors engineered yeast with a strategic block in a sulfur assimilatory pathway that leads to sulfur buildup. This sulfur producing yeast are very efficient at precipitating copper, cadmium, zinc, lead, and mercury, into dense aggregates in the yeast cell membrane. Together, these technologies provide a diverse array of metal remediation strategies.\n\nProblem Addressed: Heavy metal pollution is a major threat to the environment and human health.  Runoff from industrial manufacturing, consumer waste, and mining sources are major contributors to heavy metal pollution of waterways. Current methods for removing heavy metal contamination are expensive to develop and manufacture and are themselves often prone to forming waste by-products. These inventors have engineered metal consuming yeast as a bioremediation technique to remove heavy metal contamination from water.\n\nAdvantages: Metal bioremediation technique using genetically engineered yeast. Autonomous, non-reactive, non-toxic metal remediation. Customizable metal specificity and metal uptake sensitivity. Scalable production using techniques established in brewing and wine industries. Simple storage of dried yeast. Translatable to rare metal mining applications"
MIT,Delivery of Preassembled Double-Stranded Short Interference RNA-Argonaute Protein Complexes for Enhanced RNAi-BasedTherapeutics,Case number: #19340,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/delivery-preassembled-double-stranded-short,"Increasing the efficiency of knockdown using siRNA or miRNA has the potential to boost RNAi technology’s performance in the clinic.\n\nTechnology: Ago2 is a core component of RISC complex that executes the actual silencing step of RNAi. The current invention preassembles siRNA or miRNA with Ago2 and demonstrates that transfection of preassembled complexes has a higher knockdown efficiency at the same concentration compared to siRNA or miRNA alone. This effect is as high as 3 fold and increases as the molar ratio of Ago2 to siRNA/miRNA gets closer to 1:1.\n\nProblem Addressed: Delivering sufficient amount of siRNA or miRNA to achieve efficient knockdown is a challenge in RNAi therapy. Thus, there is a need to increase the efficiency of knockdown per molecule delivered. The current invention delivers preassembled siRNA or miRNA with argonaute protein (Ago2) to enhance knockdown efficiency.\n\nAdvantages: Preassembled siRNA or miRNA with Ago2 protein increases knockdown efficiency by as much as 3 fold"
MIT,A Biomedical Imaging and Optical StimulationDevice,Case number: #18022,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/biomedical-imaging-and-optical-stimulation-device,"This technology can be used in capturing optical images of body cavities, organs, as well as stimulate biological tissues.\n\nTechnology: This technology allows a dual-functional optical probe that operates both as optical imager and multi-site stimulating probe. The working principle for this device is based on the optical reversibility in which the spatially resolved imaging or stimulation function is attained via mode division multiplexing in a light guide or waveguide structure. The probe consists of a light source array, an imaging pixel array, an optical mode multiplexer/demultiplexer, segmented waveguides, and multiple optical elements.\n\nProblem Addressed: Optical imaging of body cavities and optical stimulation of biological tissues are often considered as two separate procedures. The endoscopy-based optical imaging requires endoscopes that are relatively large in size with a limited structural flexibility and a small field of view. Alternatively, the optical-fiber-based neuromodulation requires waveguide arrays to stimulate multiple spatial site. These arrays have similar challenges to endoscopes of increased size, mechanical rigidity, and limited invasiveness to biological tissues.\n\nAdvantages: Multifunctional probe. Minimally invasive. Small probe size. Wide field of view. Multi-site stimulation. Low optical loss. The light source and the biological tissues are thermally isolated"
MIT,Diazene Directed Modular Synthesis ofOligocyclotryptamines,Case number: #18747,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/diazene-directed-modular-synthesis,"This technology is a novel synthesis technique for making oligocyclotryptamine molecules with applications in chemical engineering and pharmaceutical R&D.\n\nTechnology: This synthesis reaction is the first generalizable strategy for generating oligocyclotryptamines with complete stereochemical control. The reaction is facilitated by first synthesizing aryl-alkyl diazenes that serve as monomers that are then iteratively reacted to build the large oligocyclotryptamine molecules. Additionally, this system is modular, and the inventors describe successful synthesis of pure enantiomeric forms of five different oligocyclotryptamine molecules by simply switching diazene monomer choice.\n\nProblem Addressed: Hexahydropyrroloindole alkaloids, including oligocyclotryptamines, are structurally complex, naturally occurring chemicals with a wide range of therapeutically relevant properties, including antibacterial, antifugal, anticancer, and analgesic activity. However, the biological activity of oligocyclotryptamines is highly dependent on the enantiomeric form of the molecule, and the rare oligocyclotryptamines found in nature exist as a mix of enantiomers. Additionally, the presence of multiple stereocenters makes chemical synthesis of pure enantiomers nearly impossible, and therefore, the potential therapeutic properties of oligocyclotryptamines have remained largely unexplored.\n\nAdvantages: Efficient synthesis of biologically active oligocyclotryptamines. Complete control of stereochemistry at all stereocenters. Highly modular, generalizable synthesis that can be applied to synthesis of many different oligocyclotryptamine molecules"
MIT,Discovery of Self-LabelingMiniproteins,Case number: #18742,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/discovery-self-labeling-miniproteins,"This technology is a self-labeling mini-protein with potential applications as a molecular biology research tool, or as a manufacturing technique for antibody-drug conjugates.\n\nTechnology: This technology uses self-labeling mini-proteins to attach functional labels or small molecules to a protein-of-interest. Self-labeling proteins work by first making a fusion protein that combines the protein-of-interest with the self-labeling protein. The self-labeling portion of the fusion protein is then reacted with a substrate that contains a label such as a fluorophore, pull-down-tag, or small molecule. The self-labeling nature of the fusion protein means that molecular biology investigators can easily interchange the label to perform many different kinds of assays. Previous self-labeling protein technologies, such as CLIP or Halo tags, are bulky (>100 amino acids) and therefore frequently disrupt the functionality of the target protein. In contrast, the self-labeling mini-proteins of this invention are small (<30 amino acids), which minimizes their impact on the structure and function of the target protein. Additionally, the mini-protein reaction with the substrate is highly specific, so only proteins containing the tag are labeled.\n\nProblem Addressed: Protein labels, such as fluorophores, dyes, pull-down tags, or small molecules are frequently used to research protein characteristics. However, current labeling strategies have significant limitations including lack of label interchangeability, difficulty specifically targeting the protein of interest, or relying on bulky protein tags that can disrupt the structure, function, and localization of the labeled protein.\n\nAdvantages: Highly-specific self-labeling mini-protein sequences. Interchangeable labeling through substrate choice. Less than half the size of existing self-labeling protein tags, which minimizes disruption of the protein of interest"
MIT,Sound Pressure Level Sensitive Passive Hearing Protector by AcousticMetamaterials,Case number: #18005,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/sound-pressure-level-sensitive-passive-hearing,"This technology can be used in making passive hearing protection device for personnel working in high-noise operational environments such as:\n\naircraft and helicopter cockpits\ncarrier decks\nweapon training\ncombat\nmining and metal industry\n\nTechnology: This technology uses acoustic meta-materials to create a passive hearing protection device that can attenuate incoming acoustic pressure waves in specific frequency range. Unlike in traditional passive hearing protection devices, the acoustic transmission coefficient in the invented design decreases with an increase in the incoming sound pressure level by utilizing a water droplet in the transmitting channel. The enhanced interaction of the acoustic wave and the meta-materials makes the size of the device few centimeters that weighs in tens of grams.\n\nProblem Addressed: High intensity noise exposure can severely damage hearing. Conventional earplugs attenuate all sound irrespective of frequency reducing operational capability of the person concerned. On the contrary, state-of-the-art active noise canceling circuitry requires additional power supply. The complex design of these noise-canceling headphones leads to higher manufacturing cost compared to the passive devices.\n\nAdvantages: Compact size. Light weight. Low cost. No additional power supply"
MIT,Noncontact PowerSensing,Case number: #18553,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/noncontact-power-sensing,"The apparatus and associated techniques are designed for non-intrusive monitoring of electric and magnetic fields. It may be applied in energy delivery systems needed to monitor the consumption of electricity in homes or businesses.\n\nTechnology: This non-intrusive power monitoring apparatus provides circuit information without coming in contact with the circuit. The apparatus comprises a capacitive pickup, circuitry for sensing a signal from the pickup, an Analog to Digital Converter, and a digital filter that rejects low-frequency disturbances. The sensor’s design allows an untrained user to place the device in a suitable position to measure a physical parameter (electric or magnetic field) produced by existing installed equipment. In order to maximize the dependence of gain on plate-to-wire distance, the system takes a differential measurement of two vertically stacked sensor plates. Doing so neatly selects the signal from a nearby wire and rejects signals from distant wires. The circuitry of the sensor is optimally designed to be fast enough to respond to the fluctuations in monitored power and strong enough to obtain usable voltage signals out of the amplifier.\n\nProblem Addressed: Reducing utility customer power consumption could lead to improvements in greenhouse gas emissions. With the help of power monitoring information, a smart grid can allow customers to capitalize on energy savings. Centralized power monitoring systems identify and monitor loads according to their current signatures. These systems employ closed or clamp core sensors to provide current sense signals, which are impractical in many retrofit applications. Firstly, skilled labor is required to separate line and neutral in order to deploy a wrap-around sensor, and secondly, in some industrial environments electrical service interruption may be unacceptable or prohibitively expensive. Non-contact power monitoring addresses both of these problems, but current solutions require replacement of the existing circuit breaker. As a result, there is a significant increase in cost on the consumer end.\n\nAdvantages: Easy installation does not require a hired technician. Enables power monitoring without altering circuit. Lower cost, more sensitive, and more robust sensor because of integrated capacitive pickups"
MIT,Random Access Memory Based on In-planeFerroelectricity,Case number: #18555J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/random-access-memory-based-plane-ferroelectricity,"This invention can be used as random access memory in electronic devices.\n\nTechnology: The memory device has at least one semiconductor layer, one writing electrode and one reading electrode. The semiconductor layer is made of ferroelectric material having an in-plane polarization component switchable between two opposite directions. These two polarization states represent the “0” and “1” bit of the information. Such robust ferroelectricity at room temperature in atomic-thick thin films is viable in specific materials such as SnTe. The writing electrode applies a writing voltage to the semiconductor layer and switches the in-plane polarization component between the two directions. The reading electrode applies a reading voltage that measures the tunneling current substantially perpendicular to the direction of the in-plane polarization component. Different in-plane polarization direction bends the local electronic band structure of the semiconductor layer differently, resulting a very sensitive dependence of the electric tunneling potential perpendicular to the semiconductor layer on the direction of the in-plane polarization. This enables a nondestructive polarization state readout. An additional thin insulator layer can be sandwiched between the semiconductor layer and the two electrodes in order to prolong the lifetime of the in-plane polarization state and prevent electric leakage through the electrode.\n\nProblem Addressed: Conventional memory devices using out-of-plane polarization of ferroelectric materials have several drawbacks. First, the reading process is destructive and a reset electric field is usually applied to maintain the initial polarization, which increases the device complexity and power consumption. Second, the material typically has a thickness greater than a required threshold thickness to build up the polarization field; therefore this limits the smallest possible size of the device. The proposed memory is based on in-plane polarized ferroelectric state. The reading process is nondestructive and the memory device can be as thin as one unit cell (UC) of the ferroelectric material.\n\nAdvantages: Low power consumption. Fast write operations. Durable storage. Small device size"

MIT,"Manufacture of Thermo-Responsive Hydrogel Composing of Drug-Nanocapsule for Sustainable  Release of Ibuprofen, Ofloxacin andDexamethasone",Case number: #18561,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/manufacture-thermo-responsive-hydrogel-composing-drug,"This drug delivery technology allows sustained, localized delivery of one or more drugs and has potential applications in cancer, immunotherapy, and ophthalmology therapies.\n\nTechnology: This technology is a thermo-responsive hydrogel built from bottlebrush polymers that are liquid at room temperature and undergo solidification into a gel at body temperature. This thermo-responsive transition from solution to gel allows straightforward injection of the hydrogel into the target location. The material then retains the encapsulated therapeutic at the target site through gelation, releasing the therapy slowly with controlled kinetics depending on the bottlebrush polymer structure. The bottlebrush copolymer consists of a backbone with many long polymeric sidechains extending from the backbone. This thermo-responsive hydrogel has three primary types of polymeric side chain sequentially arranged in blocks along the backbone. The three side chain types are polyesters, which are hydrophobic and biodegradable, polyethers, which are hydrophilic, and a safe derivative of polyacrylamides, which performs the sol-gel transition. In aqueous solutions, the bottlebrush copolymers self-assemble into micelles with polyester hydrophobic cores, polyether middles that promote solubility, and polyacrylamide protrusions that facilitate the sol-gel transition. Any hydrophobic drug molecule can be loaded into the bottlebrush copolymer hydrogel, and the inventors describe successful loading of NSAIDs, antibiotics, corticosteroids, chemotherapeutics, and immune modulators. Additionally, multiple drugs can be loaded into the same hydrogel by adding combinations of drug into the aqueous assembly.\n\nProblem Addressed: Localized drug delivery has the potential to greatly improve patient outcomes by delivering high levels of therapeutics directly to the location in need of treatment while reducing systemic side effects. However, manufacturing, drug loading, and delivery of these sustained release therapeutics remains a challenge. These inventors have designed an innovative thermo-responsive hydrogel based on bottlebrush polymers that overcomes many of the current challenges in the field of sustained release therapeutics. The synthesis is modular and scalable, with a wide range of compatibility with small molecule and biologic agents.\n\nAdvantages: Innovative thermo-responsive hydrogel composed of bottlebrush copolymers for injectable sustained release therapeutics. Simple assembly of bottlebrush copolymers. Straightforward drug loading by aqueous self-assembly. Capable of loading of any hydrophobic drug. Enables sustained release combination therapy"
MIT,Ground-Based System for Geolocation of Perpetrators of Aircraft LaserStrikes,Case number: #18562L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/ground-based-system-geolocation-perpetrators-aircraft,"This invention allows almost immediate geolocation of perpetrators of aircraft laser strikes.\n\nTechnology: The system for geolocation of a laser light source includes at least two spaced-apart ground-based sensors for receiving light from the laser source that has been off-axis scattered by air molecules and particulates to form imagery from the scattered light; and a processor operating on the scattered light imagery from the two sensors to locate the laser source. Post-event algorithms can be used to overlay laser beam direction with aircraft coordinates to aid prosecution activities.\n\nProblem Addressed: Laser strikes against commercial aircraft are a growing problem in the United States. In the last decade there has been a large increase in the number of incidents reported to the Federal Aviation Administration, likely driven by the increasing availability of high power, low cost laser pointers. Reports increased rapidly in 2015, with 7,703 incidents compared to 3,894 in 2014. However, current responses to these incidents are limited. For persistent incidents in a given location, air traffic controllers may change departure and landing patterns to avoid areas where laser strikes have been reported. For more egregious incidents, police helicopters may be deployed to try and find the perpetrator on the ground using the helicopter’s onboard infrared sensors. This invention aims to reduce the number of attacks by allowing fast response times to incidents.\n\nAdvantages: Automatic detection and geolocation. Persistent protection of highly critical air space. Strong deterrent effects"
MIT,Olefin Oligomerization in Metal-OrganicFrameworks,Case number: #17945,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/olefin-oligomerization-metal-organic-frameworks,"This invention describes the preparation of porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), consisting of organic compounds coordinated to metal ions, for use as efficient heterogeneous catalysts for olefin oligomerization.\n\nTechnology: The inventors combine an organic compound containing N-heterocyclic ligating groups and metal ions to generate porous MOFs. The metal ions at the nodes of the MOF function as active sites for olefin oligomerization, making them efficient heterogeneous catalysts. Azolate-based metal-organic frameworks are used as catalysts for olefin oligomerization. A particular framework MFU-41 is soaked in a nickel nitrate hydrate solution to afford the nickel-exchanged material Ni-MFU-41. This compound is treated with methylaluminoxane (MAO) to generate a material that is active for ethylene dimerization. The catalyst is loaded into a suitable slurry reactor and olefins of choice are oligomerized when introduced directly into the reactor. This potential slurry reactor may include at least one organic solvent, the olefin to be reacted, and an alkylaluminum species in amounts suitable for the catalyst. This reaction is run at a controlled temperature and pressure for a period of time to yield the desired olefin oligomer.\n\nProblem Addressed: Although homogenous catalysts currently dominate commercial processes for olefin oligomerization, it has been of great industrial interest to find heterogeneous alternatives to extend catalyst lifetime by preventing biomolecular decomposition. A wide variety of materials have been examined as heterogeneous catalysts for ethylene oligomerization including nickel oxide and larger pore materials such as nickel-exchanged mesoporous silica, but these materials exhibit poor activity and low oligomer selectivity. Recent attempts to develop heterogeneous catalysts have sought to graft known homogeneous units onto metal-organic frameworks. However, this method exhibits poor catalyst loading and severely reduces the porosity of the material, which limits its commercial viability.\n\nAdvantages: Azolate-based MOFs surpass all other heterogeneous catalysts in terms of maximizing activity/selectivity for olefin oligomerization. Method presents high catalytic turnover, high selectivity of catalysts, long catalyst lifetime and catalyst reusability for efficient olefin oligomerization"
MIT,Structured DNAConjugates,Case number: #18588,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/structured-dna-conjugates,"This technology is a method of creating custom 3D polyhedral DNA nanostructures. These nanostructures can be designed to mimic biological structures such as virus capsids, toxins, protein assemblies, lipids, and sugars. Therefore, this technology has many potential applications including drug delivery, immuno-stimulation for vaccines, and biosensing for diagnostic use.\n\nTechnology: This technology describes a method for the top-down design of nucleic acid nanostructures based just on target shape. This approach involves first choosing a polyhedral form as the target structure and the desired geometric parameters and physical dimensions of it. Geometric parameters like vertex, face, and edge information can be determined from a polyhedral wire-mesh model of the target shape. The process continues by establishing the route of the single-stranded nucleic acid scaffold that traces throughout the structure, and finally determining the sequences of the scaffold strand and staple strands. Identifying the route of the scaffold is a multi-step process that makes use of a spanning tree, which establishes connectivity between all the vertices in the nanostructure. Once the spanning tree is generated, it can be used to produce a Eulerian circuit (a trail in a graph that visits every edge exactly once and starts and ends on the same vertex). Asymmetric polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to make the nanostructures from the template nucleic acid scaffold. The nanostructures can contain one or more moieties, such as proteins, lipids, small molecules, and RNAs bound to them for use in various applications.\n\nProblem Addressed: DNA nanostructures, also known as DNA origami, are 3D structures made of numerous short staple strands of DNA which guide the folding of a long scaffold polynucleotide strand into a custom polyhedral shape. There are currently several computational design tools that facilitate manual, bottom-up programming of DNA origami to form a desired shape using complementary Watson-Crick base pairing. However, only one approach tackles the inverse problem of using the geometry of a target shape to design a DNA nanostructure, and this method has its limitations. For example, it is only semi-automated and may produce unstable nanostructures that are unsuitable for many applications. Additionally, the geometries produced through this method must be spherical, restricting its scope. This MIT technology is fully automated and can produce a wide variety of non-spherical shapes, providing more versatility for applications with specific shape requirements.\n\nAdvantages: Fully automatic structure formation from only target shape. Generates many different topologies, not just spherical. Capable of modification pre- or post-assembly to be conjugated with other molecules.

MIT,"N/ASynergistic Tumor Treatment with IL-2, an Integrin-Binding-FC Fusion Protein, and a CancerVaccine",Case number: #18598HJ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/nasynergistic-tumor-treatment-il-2-integrin-binding,"This technology is method of treating cancer by delivering a combination of IL-2, an integrin binding knottin-Fc fusion protein, and a cancer vaccine that has wide-ranging potential as a cancer immunotherapy.\n\nTechnology: This technology is a three-component combination immunotherapy composed of a pharmacokinetically improved IL-2, a knottin-Fc fusion protein, and a cancer vaccine. IL-2 is a cytokine that can activate both innate natural killer (NK) cell immunity and adaptive T-cell immunity. IL-2 treatment is currently approved for use in treating several cancers. However, IL-2 therapies are highly toxic due to the short half life that necessitates very high dosing. The first component of this invention is a pharmacokinetically (PK) improved IL-2. These inventors fused IL-2 to albumin or Fc, which stabilizes the serum circulation half-life of IL-2. The second component of this invention is a bi-functional Knottin-Fc fusion protein that targets the molecule to cancer cells and induces an immune response. Knottins are compact, exceptionally stable proteins that are useful as molecular scaffolds. These inventors engineered knottin derivatives that selectively bind cancer-associated integrin proteins, which allows specific binding of the knottin-Fc fusion protein to cancer cells. Fc peptides are an immunogenic component of antibodies, and cells bound to Fc fragments surface are targeted by NK cells for destruction. Upon binding to Fc on a target cell, NK cells release cytotoxic compounds directly into the Fc-bound cell and release cytokines that stimulate local inflammation and adaptive immunity responses. The inventors demonstrate that. in vivo. administration of PK-IL-2 and knottin-Fc results in robust tumor regression and increases in lifespan in a variety of mouse cancer models. Additionally, this treatment paradigm works synergistically with existing cancer vaccines such as immune checkpoint blockade therapies. The inventors demonstrate that mice treated with a combination of PK-IL-2, knottin-Fc, and anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1 antibodies have impressive, lasting therapeutic responses.\n\nProblem Addressed: Cancer immunotherapies harness patients’ own immune systems to fight cancerous lesions. Immunotherapies such as tumor-specific monoclonal antibody treatment, immunostimulatory cytokine treatments, and immune checkpoint blockade therapies have demonstrated efficacy in a wide variety of cancers including melanoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer. However, there are still many challenges in the field of cancer immunotherapies. Firstly, most immunotherapies need to be specifically tailored to each cancer subtype. Additionally, predicting therapeutic outcome is difficult, and different patients with the same cancer and therapeutic dosing might exhibit either robust tumor remission or complete failure of treatment. Finally, cancers that lack known tumor antigens or have low antigenic burden are almost impossible to target with current immunotherapies. These inventors have engineered a combination therapy that is able to address these issues in cancer immunotherapy.\n\nAdvantages: Longer serum half-life of IL-2 through fusion to albumin or albumin binding peptides. Targeting of immunogenic Fc to cancer cells through binding to cancer-associated integrins. Potential as a generalized cancer immunotherapy since cancer-associated integrins are overexpressed in diverse cancer types. Synergistic therapeutic response when combined with immune checkpoint blockade or tumor-specific antibodies"
MIT,Planar Mixed-Metal PerovskitePhotovoltaics,Case number: #17938,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/planar-mixed-metal-perovskite-photovoltaics,"This technology is designed for photovoltaic devices but could be generalized to other optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting devices, photodetectors, or lasers.\n\nTechnology: By replacing small, but significant, amounts of the lead content with a second metal species, it was estimated that the perovskite lattice might be tolerant of the extrinsic species and that the excellent electronic properties of the lead-based perovskite might be perturbed but not completely disrupted, allowing for efficient or even improved photovoltaic performance. The extrinsic species were cations including, but not limited to, cobalt ions, copper ions, and iron ions. The net result of improvements to these individual performance parameters is often an increase in the overall power conversion efficiencies of a mixed-metal device over the pure-lead (Pb) system. A mixed cobalt (Co) device where 1/32nd of the Pb content is replaced with Co achieved a measured efficiency of 11.1%, the highest measured for any planar mixed-metal perovskite solar cell.\n\nProblem Addressed: Perovskite devices have increased their efficiency from 6.5% to 20.1%. However, there are two central issues with commercialization of perovskite solar cells, the toxicity, and the long-term stability of the lead-based materials. This design simultaneously mitigates the toxicity and instability of the perovskite materials by introducing a second less-toxic metal species into the perovskite film.\n\nAdvantages: Decreases toxicity of perovskite photovoltaics. Increases stability of perovskite photovoltaics"
MIT,Printable Programmable ViscoelasticMaterials,Case number: #18624,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/printable-programmable-viscoelastic-materials,"The Inventors demonstrate a new method for 3D printing viscoelastic materials (PVMs) with specified material properties that minimize impact and vibration. This technology has many applications to design and print robotic devices in industries ranging from commercial to medical or aerospace manufacturing. Customized impact protection could allow robots to be more resilient, accurate, and reduce controller complexity and effort. The vibration damping properties of PVMs can be used in traditional hard robotics to protect sensitive devices such as cameras and electronics from the vibrations of motors, generators and movement.\n\nTechnology: The Inventors modify a commercially available inkjet 3D printer to modified to simultaneously print with different solid and liquid materials. Via hydraulic pressure, a liquid material alongside a flexible material is continuously distributed with adjacent droplets of each material type. Multi-material objects fabricated in this manner are specified by an occupancy matrix. The entries of this matrix correspond to the voxels of the part that will be built. Materials with mechanical properties that differ from the base materials can be specified by assigning different fractions of randomly chosen voxels to one material type or another, assuming that the chosen voxels lie within the bounding surface of the part that will be fabricated. This approach allows customized PVMs to be designed and fabricated based on an algorithm that factors in whether the viscoelastic material is likely to be used in small or large deformations. Vibration damping applications typically fall into the former category, while impact absorbing cases fit the latter. The desired material property is chosen, and the liquid percentage is generated based on an algorithm developed by the Inventors.\n\nProblem Addressed: Impact protection and vibration isolation are an important component in mobile robot design. However, current damping materials are available only in bulk or molded form, requiring manual fabrication steps and restricting material property control. The Inventors demonstrate a new method for 3D printing viscoelastic materials with specified material properties. This method allows arbitrary net-shape material geometries to be rapidly fabricated and enables continuously varying material properties throughout the finished part. This new ability allows robot designers to tailor the properties of viscoelastic damping materials in order to reduce impact forces and isolate vibrations.\n\nAdvantages: Novel method for device fabrication allows for modifiable, programmable viscoelastic properties. Fabricates robots that can absorb impact and vibrations for better durability and locomotion. Method does not require difficult setup and can be used with standard 3D inkjet printers"
MIT,"High Molecular Weight, Post-Translationally Modified Proteins Brushes Through Tyrosine ModificationChemistry",Case number: #17927,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/high-molecular-weight-post-translationally-modified,"This invention enables the facile synthesis of high molecular weight mucins, the gel forming constituent and defining component of mucus.  They are of interest to the defense and pharmaceutical industries because of their role in the human body’s primary defense against pathogens and toxins. Since mucus can decrease drug bioavailability, pharmaceutical companies may use mucins to test drug candidates. In the defense industry, there is considerable interest in using mucins to combat exogenous biological threats.\n\nTechnology: This invention generates artificially engineered respiratory mucin mimetic proteins that can be post-translationally modified through diazonium coupling to generate glycosylated products. The mucin mimetic proteins can then be extended via the oxidative coupling of cysteine residues to produce high molecular weight, densely functionalized mucin mimetic materials. The engineered mucin mimetic is comprised of the most frequent sequence of the variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) of respiratory mucins. Serines and threonines in these repeats have been replaced with tyrosines to facilitate diazonium-coupling and functionalization of the protein. Flanking the VNTR with cysteine residues facilitates protein-chain elongation through disulfide coupling.\n\nProblem Addressed: Mucins are highly glycosylated, high molecular weight polymers that are very challenging to synthesize via chemical or molecular biology methods. Scraping pig stomachs yields microgram quantities of mucin and is the most common means of obtaining these polymers. However, synthetic methods exists to produce mucins, and are limited by their failure to generate highly glycosylated mucins that retain the physical and functional characteristics of native sources. This invention generates a protein series that mimics native respiratory mucins, generating high molecular weight and densely functionalizable mucin mimetic materials suitable for testing drug bioavailability.\n\nAdvantages: Cost-effective post-translational modification to generate high molecular weight and densely functionalized mucin mimetics. Mass functionalization of protein residues (rather than step-wise or individual residue functionalization)"
MIT,Application of Data Proxies and Cognitive Firewalls to a Secure and Resource-Efficient Implementation for ConnectedSystems,Case number: #18635,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/application-data-proxies-and-cognitive-firewalls,"The Inventors propose a technique for the secure and efficient implementation of connected systems via use of Data Proxies that approximate the state of a system with minimal resource inputs. Proxies abstract connectivity between applications and end devices, offering a chance to improve system security through the use of Cloud resources. This technology will enable connectivity to be deployed across more devices and larger networks including IoT systems, local area networks, and all other connected systems to improve security while minimizing resource use.\n\nTechnology: Data Proxies are a means of applying observers and estimators to generate digital duplicates of physical systems. The use of an estimator allows the reduction in sampling and transmission rate at the device and improves security by eliminating the possibility of direct connectivity between a device and an application. In the Inventors’ model, Data Proxies extend the Cloud architecture, with estimators creating interpolated approximates rather than exact mirrors of input data. The system employs an “Application Agent,” which is a query manager running in the Cloud. The Application Agent uses the meta-QoD aggregated from a Proxy’s entire application payload, and dynamically determines the most resource efficient configuration of requests.\n\nProblem Addressed: The world’s devices, services, and people are increasingly interconnected. However, challenges to the creation of pervasive connectivity exist. To ensure that even resource-constrained devices can belong to interconnected systems, there is a need for a system-wide input minimization. This results in optimized systems that use computation and power where it is more available, less costly, and more easily scaled in gateway devices or in the Cloud. The Inventors’ model builds a layer of intelligent Data Proxies based on statistical and physical system models to efficiently meet prescribed Quality of Data (QoD) requirements for various applications while improving security. Additionally, a Cognitive Firewall for system protection is introduced, as well as a process framework for optimally minimizing resource requirements.\n\nAdvantages: System offers resource reductions that enable increased connectivity while addressing consumer and industry demands for enhanced security. System saves bandwidth and power, which contributes the loner operational life and lower operating cost for sensors in the field. Proxies allow for temporal/spatial interpolation of data, improving time constant of system"
MIT,"Design of Mechanism for a Low-Cost, Completely Passive Prosthetic Knee for Users with Above-KneeAmputation",Case number: #17907,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/design-mechanism-low-cost-completely-passive,"This passive device is a prosthetic for above-knee amputees and is especially suited for developing countries with limited availability of advanced medical care.\n\nTechnology: Optimal mechanical components were designed using biomechanical modeling and inverse dynamics analysis. The prosthetic knee includes a linear spring and friction dampers that engage and disengage at optimal times in the gait cycle to provide able-bodied kinematics with minimal patient energy expenditure.  The spring and damping system provide early stance flexion-extension and late stance and swing control respectively. The design has an automatic early stance lock for stability.  The spring stiffness and damper friction may be adjusted for patient and device weight.  A small user trial showed a smooth transition from stance to swing and easy usability of the prosthetic. This invention is a passive prosthetic knee design that is low cost with improvements over current devices that could allow large scale manufacturing for widespread use in developing countries.\n\nProblem Addressed: There are an estimated 30 million people worldwide in need of prosthetics and orthotic devices. According to the World Health Organization, 90-95% of amputees in developing countries do not have access to prosthetics largely due to high cost. In India alone, there are approximately 230,000 transfemoral amputees. Most currently distributed above-knee prostheses are inexpensive passive devices that hinder a normative gait and incur frequent mechanical failure. This technology is a low-cost, fully passive prosthetic knee design that closely mimics able-bodied kinematics ideally suited for above-knee amputees in developing countries.\n\nAdvantages: Requires minimal patient energy expenditure.

MIT,Additive Manufacturing of VacuumPumps,Case number: #19164J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/additive-manufacturing-vacuum-pumps,"Miniaturized vacuum pumps are used in a variety of compact systems including mass spectrometers, analytical sensors and in prototyping of miniature roughing pump applications.\n\nTechnology: Multi-material miniaturized diaphragm pumps provide improved performance and longevity previously unseen in an additively manufactured pump. The pumps have a series of valves and a compression chamber with several different stiffness values. The valves are made of a softer, flexible material and the pump compression chambers are made of a harder, flexible material. This change in rigidity greatly increases the device lifetime. The pump valves and chambers are pneumatically actuated, but they can also be actuated using embedded (printed or non-printed) magnets. 3D printing could require support or sacrificial material that must be removed from the final product. A disposable support pump provides a full removal of the sacrificial material without damaging the pump. This support pump can also clean the main pump and clean the complex microfluidics.\n\nProblem Addressed: Various microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) use a supply of gases at precise flow rates and pressure levels to maintain a vacuum or to compress pockets of gas at low pressure. Currently, there are no microfabricated pumps that can deliver significant flow rates and vacuum levels. Traditional, i.e., cleanroom, microfabrication results in a number of complications including a high dead-to-total volume ratio, large hydraulic resistance, slow actuator pace, and significant valve leak rates. These issues lead to pressure drops in the pumps that negatively impact their performance and limit the vacuum generation capabilities of the pumps. Cleanroom microfabrication is also expensive and time-consuming, which makes them incompatible with low-cost applications. Through 3D printing, devices with the right geometries and materials can be monolithically created, resulting in high-performance devices.\n\nAdvantages: Multi-staged pumps greatly decrease the base pressure, also yielding increased power efficiency. Bowed compression chamber sidewalls minimize dead volume, increasing power efficiency and decreasing manufacturing costs. 3D printing process lowers manufacturing cost and enables portability and autonomous systems"
MIT,Continuous Authentication in Internet ofThings,Case number: #17905,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/continuous-authentication-internet-things,"The Inventors propose a novel continuous authentication protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT) based on secret sharing schemes. This protocol provides secure and efficient authentication for frequent message transmission in short session time intervals. IoT applications can involve environment monitoring, e-health, electric vehicle and the smart house, in which appliances and services that provide notifications, security, energy-saving, automation, telecommunication, computers and entertainment are integrated into a single ecosystem with a shared user interface.\n\nTechnology: The Inventors employ secret sharing and time-bound concepts to build this continuous authentication protocol. They use the Shamir secret sharing scheme whereby shares of secret s are generated and distributed to n shareholders, from which t out of n shareholders can reconstruct the secret. They use the (t, n) scheme not to secure the secret by distributing its shares to n entities, but rather to authenticate the Claimer (secret and shares generator) to the recipient (Verifier) in a pre-defined time frame. This way, the Verifier will be able to link the received share to its original secret, thus authenticating the Claimer without performing costly public/private key operations.\n\nProblem Addressed: By connecting sensors, smart devices and everyday physical objects with the Internet, IoT provides a new form of communications for people and devices, which makes the virtual information world integrated seamlessly with the real world. As many of these applications are related to a user’s daily life, privacy and security aspects are very important. Unfortunately, the nature of the complex and heterogenous structure of IoT makes the security issues very challenging. In addition, most nodes are resource-limited, which makes the feature of lightweight necessary for IoT security mechanisms. The Inventors propose a lightweight protocol that satisfies all security requirements, via a novel secret sharing scheme, whereby the secret is used as an authenticator and the shares are used as authenticator tokens.\n\nAdvantages: Security evaluation of the protocol shows that it fulfils the stated security requirements and addresses all IoT threat and attacks. Lightweight, thus addressing the resource-constrained IoT endpoints. Protocol does not require costly key cryptography operations, allow fast and efficient continuous authentication"
MIT,Methods for Fabricating Low Cost 3D Printed Parts With Expanded MaterialProperties,Case number: #17894,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/methods-fabricating-low-cost-3d-printed-parts,"This invention describes a 3D printing system that forms an object by filling a customized matrix with a curing casting material or a liquid filler material with desirable properties.\n\nTechnology: This invention describes a 3D printing system that includes a customized matrix having suitable material properties and geometric patterning to facilitate filling and retention of the filler material. The matrix is designed as a minimal structure to hold and constrain the casting material and define its 3D geometry. The matrix can be produced by 3D printing or by assembling premade geometric forms into a final matrix. Sensors can be incorporated into the premade geometric forms of the matrix to monitor various signals within the parts, such as stress, strain, pressure motion, temperature, etc. The filling is accomplished by injection of the casting material into the 3D construct. The casting material can be held in place by forces such as hydrophilic/hydrophobic/electrostatic interactions or through chemical interactions between the casting material and the 3D construct surface. The casting material can be further constrained by forces external to the 3D construct by filling the 3D construct with a filler material, and then subsequently submerging it in a desirable fluid. The submersion fluid can have specific properties to assist in the filling of the customized matrix by the filler material. Finally, the filler material retained within the customized matrix is cured or solidified to produce the object. The curing can occur in a gas, such as air or nitrogen, or in a submersion fluid. Since the various characteristics of the customized matrix, liquid filler material and submersion fluid can all be optimized together, a table/chart/algorithm can be created for optimal selection for object creation.\n\nAdvantages: Sequential process which overcomes material limitations of standard 3D printing. Customized matrix with specific properties facilitates the retention of filler materials. Customized matrix helps create objects comprising of cavities, holes, channels or voids"
MIT,Engineered Multifunctional Particles for Enhanced OilRecovery,Case number: #17892,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/engineered-multifunctional-particles-enhanced-oil,"This technology can be used as an oil tracer, pH sensor, size detector, thermal detector, or ionization sensor in enhanced oil recovery. These particles can be used as several different sensors to increase oil recovery efficiency through a better understanding of the underground wells.\n\nTechnology: The general principle of these nanoparticles is a silica or calcium carbonate (CaCO3) “shell” that encapsulates a desired surfactant. This surfactant can create micelles with different types of DNA to create various sensors. The thickness and size control the conditions of release. For an oil tracer, DNA is encapsulated in CaCO3, which can probe the structure of underground oil well systems and trace the external additives and their performance by having different DNA species corresponding to and injected with different additives. Additionally, DNA secondary structures, A-motif, form depending on the pH level. Coupling this with the plasmonics of gold nanoparticles, which allows particles creating A-motif to aggregate, a pH sensor is created and, due to aggregatation, will change color between pH 3-7.2. By changing the size of the particles, a pore size detector is created. Various sizes of particles with corresponding DNA species are pumped into the well and an understanding of the pore size underground is gained based on the DNA recovered. To create a thermal detector, changes in DNA structure past a threshold temperature are monitored. Therefore, several DNAs can determine if the temperature is within a certain range. Finally, the appearance and disappearance of the top band or dimer structure is highly correlated with the magnesium salt concentration. The detection of the top band enables verification if the salt concentration is above or below the neutral balance salt concentration, creating an ionization sensor.\n\nProblem Addressed: Since surfactants can reduce interfacial tension between oil and water, delivery of surfactants to oil wells without any loss is crucial to the improvement of oil production and enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Therefore, a controlled delivery method is of interest. This method uses inorganic encapsulated surfactant nanoparticles and DNA to deliver surfactants and create several different sensors.\n\nAdvantages: Nanoparticle size, thermal, pH, and ionization sensors. Increased understanding of underground oil well conditions"
MIT,Engineering Mutasynthons for ChemicalDiversity,Case number: #17882,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/engineering-mutasynthons-chemical-diversity,"Nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) are structurally diverse molecules that have a broad range of biological activities and pharmacological properties. For example, they are widely used as pharmaceuticals (e.g., broad-spectrum antibiotics; anti-cancer drugs) and in the agricultural industry as insecticides. The ability to rationally engineer novel NRPs, especially those with structures that do not occur in nature, has an enormous impact in the expansion of the pool of chemical entities available. These entities can potentially be used to combat a variety of infections and diseases.\n\nTechnology: This technology is a method to produce a wide range of novel nonribosomal molecules by compressing two existing heterologous biosynthesis pathways and supplementing the growth medium with a precursor. The system is a modified strain of E. coli engineered to express a biosynthetic pathway composed of four components: 1) biosynthetic genes from one species encoding enzymes for the assembly of a nonribosomal molecule, 2) biosynthetic genes from a second species encoding enzymes for the assembly of a different nonribosomal molecule, 3) a gene encoding an amide synthase, and 4) exogenously supplied building blocks. The building blocks are selected based on their potential to endow the hybrid molecule with desired functionalities (e.g., metal chelation; fluorescence; bactericidal or virucidal properties). The two molecule intermediates and one building block molecule are condensed via the aforementioned amide synthase to generate one hybrid nonribosomal molecule. As such, this method allows for the rational design of novel nonribosomal molecules with hybrid functionality not found in a natural environment.\n\nProblem Addressed: NRPs are a class of peptides produced in microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. As opposed to ribosome-based synthesis, NRPs are produced by multi- domain complexes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and clusters thereof. NRPSs catalyze the sequential addition of natural and unnatural amino acids into a growing peptide chain. To this chain they can also add specific moieties (e.g., methyl groups and sugars) to specific atoms.\n\nAdvantages: Allows for the hands-off and controlled production of a diverse range of pre-designed novel nonribosomal molecules."
MIT,Methods for Conversion of Food Waste to ChemicalProducts,Case number: #17870,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/methods-conversion-food-waste-chemical-products,"This technology can be applied to produce lactic acid from solid organic waste. Lactic acid is an important commodity chemical used as an acidity regulator and flavoring agent in the food industry, and as a feedstock to produce polylactic acid (PLA) -- a biodegradable plastic.\n\nTechnology: The process described in this invention is able to use most forms of organic waste as feedstock, although waste with high sugar, starch, and/or protein content is preferred. The waste material is prepared for fermentation by grinding it to a particle size of < 1 mm and adjusting its pH to 5.5. Subsequently, the prepared waste material is anaerobically digested by a multi-species consortium of microbes comprising both bacteria and archaea members. Undesirable production of side products is a major challenge faced in obtaining high yields of lactic acid. The Inventors describe a pH-based technique to simultaneously limit production of methane and short-chain fatty acids, which are the primary side products competing with lactic acid. By using a microbial community instead of a monoculture and by using pH to control the composition of fermentation products, this invention allows production of lactic acid from organic waste while avoiding the significant overheads associated with feedstock sterilization or the use of antibiotics or other specialty chemicals to control yield. The Inventors have achieved lactic acid yields of over 100 g per ton of organic food waste using this process.\n\nProblem Addressed: Existing methods of producing lactic acid by fermentation are faced with several limitations. The current method for commercial production uses sugar as a feedstock, and therefore suffers from high raw material cost. Alternative methods that make use of organic waste have been explored, but these methods often suffer from high production overheads associated with the need to sterilize the feedstock to prevent contamination. This invention describes a novel method of lactic acid production from organic waste that addresses these problems.\n\nAdvantages: Does not require costly sterilization. Does not require addition of antibiotics or specific methanogenesis inhibitors. Uses low- or no-cost solid organic waste as feedstock"
MIT,Ultrasound-Based Absolute Scatterer Concentration Measurement Technique: Image Volume Estimation from Scatter Spread Function Extracted From theImage,Case number: #17865,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/ultrasound-based-absolute-scatterer-concentration,"The Inventors have developed a technique for concurrently measuring particle counts and scan volume to obtain absolute concentration measurements for materials with low scatter concentration.\n\nTechnology: The Inventors have developed a technique to measure the absolute concentration of scatterers in a material by using only the ultrasound image acquired by linearly scanning a disk single element transducer. Specifically, the width of a beam produced by the transducer can be estimated from the spreading of individual scatterers included in the sample. The beam widths can then be mapped as a function of the axial position of the transducer and used to estimate the image volume. If the concentration is calculated for each frame of images, these concentrations can be combined to produce a final concentration of the sample. This technique is mainly for materials with low concentration of scatterers where, on average, there is less than one scatter per resolution cell and therefore individual scatterers can be distinguished in the image. The ability to measure absolute concentration in this low range of concentration is especially significant because other established concentration measurement instruments such as a hemocytometer, coulter counter, etc. are not accurate due to the issue of small sampling volume. The reduction to practice has been carried out for linearly scanned disk single imagining only, but extension to array imaging is also possible.\n\nProblem Addressed: Ultrasound-based measurement of absolute concentration of scatterers has a wide range of potential applications, such as in microbiology, cell culture, and blood work. When a material is dilute and a scatterer size is similar to the wavelength produced by ultrasound, individual scatterers can be distinguished in an ultrasound image. A variety of techniques have been developed for estimating concentration based on overall backscatter energy and assumptions about the geometry of an ultrasound scan. The actual shape of an ultrasound beam may vary significantly based on the medium being imaged, the interface between an ultrasound transducer and the scan volume, and a variety of other factors. However, current techniques measuring concentration based on backscatter have avoided precise quantification of image volume in favor of generalized assumptions about the shape of the ultrasound beam and the scan geometry. There remains a need for an ultrasound-based concentration measurement technique where both the scatterer count and the scan volume are measured concurrently to provide absolute concentration.\n\nAdvantages: Allows for an accurate absolute concentration measurement of scatterers nondestructively (since the sample does not have to be disposed). Allows for a larger sampling sampling volume and therefore results in a more accurate measurement. Can be used as a tabletop or a portable device for particle counting and concentration measurement"
MIT,Potentially Low-Cost and Transparent Sensor Array Systems for Cellular Monitoring and Smart SkinApplications,Case number: #17850,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/potentially-low-cost-and-transparent-sensor-array,"This technology has applications in cellular monitoring and smart skin applications.\n\nTechnology: The invention is a sensor array accompanied by a custom circuit board for monitoring chemical or electrical activity, which is both compatible with optical equipment and is readily scalable. One application of this innovation is in monitoring cellular activity. The sensor array substrate and wires are all fabricated out of transparent materials, ensuring compatibility with optical equipment. The graphene Electrolyte-Gated Field-Effect Transistor (EGFET) array architecture was developed with a compact, inexpensive and self-contained measurement system capable of performing DC characterization of 256 graphene EGFETs. This enables optimization of the transistor gain, resulting in a highly sensitive sensor array. In addition, a framework for application-specific optimization of large-scale graphene EGFET sensor designs was developed. The manufacture process is both simple and cost effective. Once fabricated, the sensor array can be inserted into the custom circuit board, containing analog multiplexers for row and column selection, signal manipulation circuitry for cellular monitoring, and input ports for data acquisition and microcontrollers.\n\nProblem Addressed: Recently, sensor technology utilizes wire sharing with integrated semiconductor materials for systems requiring large arrays of sensors. These systems use silicon thin films, which are flexible; however, the process of making the films is expensive and adds complexity to the fabrication process. The technology relies on silicon, which is opaque, making it ill-suited for optical applications including compound microscope imaging. In addition, current designs have not maximized the gain and minimized gain variations, which are both important for optimizing the performance of gated sensor arrays in large-scale sensor systems.\n\nAdvantages: Simple, inexpensive sensor array compatible with optical equipment. Highly sensitive sensor arrays due to optimized gain in EGFETs. Can be fabricated on flexible polymer substrates"

The absorption and scattering characteristics of the sample shows close and unique correlation with the constituent properties essential for the required quantification. Usage of LEDs as the light source and conventional digital cameras to capture the data for subsequent analysis makes the method low cost, high throughput, and easy for maintenance.\n\nProblem Addressed: In-process quality control in a processing industry is critical for meeting standards of the finished product, reducing waste, and optimizing the process flow. For example, in a dairy supply chain, quantification of constituents in milk is important at an early stage for elimination of abnormal milk prior to pooling and for proper management of cattle feed and health. Existing off-line methodologies are time consuming and prone to human error, while the on-line techniques provide poor results due to the composition of milk that has constituents of varying form, size, and concentration.\n\nAdvantages: Rapid online analysis. Low cost. Non-destructive. No sample preparation/wastage. Ease of maintenance"

MIT,Solar Evaporative Disposal of Produced Water With a Floating Lubricated Anti-ScalingReceiver,Case number: #17825,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/solar-evaporative-disposal-produced-water-floating,"This invention represents a transformational view of produced water disposal and has application to the oil and gas industry. Other industries that require efficient and economic systems for water treatment applications can also benefit from this technology.\n\nTechnology: This evaporation system capitalizes on a double-layered material that floats and uses freely available solar energy to treat produced water. The wavelength-selective, insulating-thermally, salt-repelling, porous (WISP) material features a spectrally-selective solar absorber layer that harvests sunlight and a bottom foam insulator layer that localizes heat to promote high evaporation rates. The top absorber layer, comprised of a carbon material (e.g., carbon black) and possibly a polymer mix, also has a layer of anti-scaling lubricant that prevents salt deposition and performance degradation over time. This floating absorber-insulator structure serves to heat the surface of an evaporation pond and enhance evaporation. A transparent cover sits above the pond to condense and collect the vaporized water for reuse.\n\nAdvantages: Use of cheap and abundant materials (economic materials for the receiver and solar energy). High efficiency. Low in complexity for rapid industry-wide adoption"
MIT,Optimal Petroleum Fuels Blending UnderUncertainty,Case number: #17503,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/optimal-petroleum-fuels-blending-under-uncertainty,"In the refining industry, crude oil procurement is the largest expenditure and has an enormous impact on refinery profitability. This technology can be used by refineries to optimize crude purchases and refiner operations.\n\nTechnology: This method reformulates the chance-constrained problem as a tractable problem by creating a two-stage stochastic programming formulation. The first stage is selecting the best crude oil combination among several candidates and their price amounts to maximize expected gross margin across all scenarios. In the second stage, the uncertainties are realized and the optimal operations of the plant are implemented such that the market demand and quality specifications are satisfied. In order to obtain the global optimal solution for this problem, the variable discretization, feasibility and optimality-based domain reduction techniques are integrated into the non-convex generalized Benders decomposition (NGDB) methodology. The enhanced NGBD approach is able to find and verify a global optimal solution within a couple of hours compared to state-of-the-art commercial software which takes several days.\n\nProblem Addressed: Crude oil and oil markets have many uncertainties associated with the quality of the crude oil and the demands in the market. However, crude oil is processed and blended to create final products such as gasoline with strict quality constraints. Therefore, optimizing crude purchases and refining processes is essential to maximizing profits. This technology finds the global optimal solution for purchasing and blending crude oil within the affiliated uncertainties.\n\nAdvantages: Optimizes crude oil purchases and blending under uncertainty. Produces global optimal solution in a couple of hours"
MIT,Synthetic Hybrid Receptor and Genetic Circuit in Probiotic Bacteria to Detect Enteric PathogenicMicroorganisms,Case number: #17801HJ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/synthetic-hybrid-receptor-and-genetic-circuit,"Cholera is an infectious disease caused by the pathogen Vibrio cholerae. It results in severe and potentially fatal symptoms including diarrhea and dehydration. Ingestible, functionalized probiotics that sense and treat cholera can be used in place of conventional antibiotics, which can confer drug resistance and/or deliver unwanted side effects. Additionally, and unlike conventional antibiotics, functionalized probiotics can be administered as a preventative measure to family members of patients and to vulnerable communities during seasonal and regional disease outbreaks.\n\nTechnology: Cholera, caused by pathogen V. cholerae, is a potentially fatal infectious disease. V. cholerae uses quorum sensing to communicate with members of its own species and to coordinate a cell density-dependent behavioral response. V. cholerae secretes and detects the quorum sensing molecule CAI-1. When secreted CAI-1 binds the cell surface receptor CqsS, a phosphorylation signal is transmitted into the cell, resulting in altered transcription. This system provides the means for a gene expression response to the detection of a specific pathogen. A hybrid receptor containing the sensory domain of CqsS enables the FDA-approved probiotic Lactococcus lactis to sense the CAI-1 that is secreted by V. cholerae. The circuit downstream of the hybrid receptor is further engineered such that binding of the receptor results in increased expression of a target gene. This target gene can be a colorimetric output for diagnosis, or a variety of antimicrobial agents such as antimicrobial particles (AMPs) or bacteriophage that can inhibit V. cholerae. This system differs from conventional antibiotics in that it serves to both detect and treat disease. It can be used as a preventative measure, a diagnostic tool, and a powerful treatment option.\n\nProblem Addressed: Cholera is an infectious disease that kills 100,000 to 120,000 people each year, mostly in developing countries. Cholera is prone to explosive seasonal and regional outbreaks and, depending on the strain of V. cholerae, can kill within hours if left untreated. The disease can usually be prevented via access to safe drinking water and sanitation. However, due to a widespread lack of environmental and sanitation infrastructure, cholera remains a global threat to public health. Probiotic bacteria that sense and kill V. cholerae can be used to treat and prevent outbreaks of a variety of strains of cholera in a safe, low-cost, and efficient manner.\n\nAdvantages: L. lactis is recognized as safe by the FDA.

MIT,Molten Metaphosphate Electrolysis for Production of WhitePhosphorus,Case number: #20843,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/molten-metaphosphate-electrolysis-production-white,"This invention utilizes molten salt electrolysis to synthesize white phosphorus. It is of interest to the chemical industries as white phosphorus is generated without producing carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide biproducts. This invention therefore lowers the carbon footprint of white phosphorus production and increases the sustainability of phosphorus chemistry.\n\nTechnology: This invention uses molten salt electrolysis technology to promote white phosphorus collection by condensation and gas separation at a geometrically designed cathode. Oxidation on the counter electrode inside a tube submerged in the molten melt separates the cathodic and anodic gas streams, allowing evolution of reactive gases like oxygen or carbon dioxide, instead of carbon monoxide. Metaphosphate is utilized as an electrolyte for phosphate reduction. The use of metaphosphate salts is beneficial due to their low melting point of 625°C, their ease of synthesis, and their ability to accept or donate oxide ions via the breaking or formation of polyphosphate bonds. By specifically using carbon-platinum molten salt electrolysis the electrochemical products are phosphorus and oxygen.\n\nProblem Addressed: Current methods of white phosphorus production in industry generate a significant amount of the unwanted byproducts carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. These byproducts generate 3,250,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually, and decrease the sustainability of the phosphorus chemistry industry. Current methods also generate calcium silicate slag, a byproduct which must be removed from reactors. This invention circumvents carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and calcium silicate production in white phosphorus production by utilizing a molten salt electrolysis technology. This technology enables the carbon-free production of white phosphorus at temperatures lower than industry standard.\n\nAdvantages: White phosphorus can be generated without the production of carbonaceous gases. Electrolysis can be performed at much lower temperatures than industry standard (800°C vs. 1500°C). Process can be scaled down and performed on-site at companies that require white phosphorus"
MIT,Segregation Resistant Perovskite Oxides with Surfaces Modified by Binary Oxides and Heterogeneous Doping,Case number: #17791,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/segregation-resistant-perovskite-oxides-surfaces,"This invention would be of interest to industries dealing with the application of perovskite oxide materials, including solid oxide fuel and electrolysis cells, catalysts for thermochemical splitting of water and carbon dioxide, oxygen permeation membranes and chemical looping, batteries, and magnetic and catalytic devices.\n\nTechnology: Perovskite oxides can be stabilized through the application of a thin film of oxidizing metal ions on the material's surface. The size mismatch, between the dopant and host cations and the associated elastic energy minimization push the larger or smaller dopants to free surface or interfaces. In addition, oxygen vacancies and the net positive charge at the surface of perovskite oxides drive the negatively charged dopants in the form of point defects to the surface. To minimize the electrostatic interactions that drive dopant segregation, this technology decreases the amount of the oxygen vacancies that can be equilibrated at the material surface. The surface positive charge is then reduced by putting more oxidizing metal cations at the surface, which lessens the amount of oxygen vacancies present, and thus, the electrostatic attraction of the dopants to the surface is weakened. By choosing a suitable surface additive cation, the stability of the perovskite oxide surface could be improved, and the final surface oxygen exchange reaction coefficient is increased up to 30 times.\n\nProblem Addressed: Existing solid oxide fuel cells and electrolysis cells (SOFC, SOEC) have proven that the surface of such perovskite oxides are not stable. These surfaces undergo segregation and phase separation of dopant oxides at and above 400 degrees Celsius. The degradation of the chemical surface is harshly detrimental due to the consequent formation of a layer that blocks charge transfer. Choosing suitable dopants will therefore hinder the secondary phase segregation.  This technology prevents elastic and electrostatic interactions, the key driving forces behind dopant segregation, by using a suitable surface additive cation that decreases the surface oxygen vacancy concentration at the surface.\n\nAdvantages: Minimizes or completely avoids segregation and phase separation of dopant cations at the surface. Improves chemical stability. Able to function at temperatures above 300 degrees Celsius. Improves surface charge transfer properties"
MIT,Nano-Fibular Nanoparticle Polymer-Drug Conjugate for Sustained Dermal Delivery ofRetinoids,Case number: #17491,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/nano-fibular-nanoparticle-polymer-drug-conjugate,"This technology has applications in the treatment of acne and skin diseases, as well as the development of anti-aging products.\n\nTechnology: In comparison to previously existing approaches, this technology conjugates ATRA to an FDA approved, soluble polymer through an ester-bond linkage, creating water-soluble polymer-drug nanomicelles with controlled ATRA release characteristics. The ATRA is conjugated to poly-(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) by DCC chemistry in a one-pot synthesis reaction. These nanomicelles have high aspect ratio nanofiber structures which facilitate uptake into the dermis while at the same time reducing mobility in the tissue, thereby enforcing controllable ATRA release. In vitro studies demonstrate ATRA as an effective anti-proliferative. In vivo studies in mice suggest that these nanomicelles ensure controlled release of ATRA, reducing irritation and inflammation at the sight of interest and promoting application and retention of the structures. The new technology could find applications in treatment of acne and skin diseases, improving therapy efficacy and reducing side effects with more controlled delivery mechanisms, while allowing for a user friendly, non-greasy formulation of the active agent.\n\nProblem Addressed: Retinoids are a broadly used class of therapeutics. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), in particular, has been widely used in formulations for anti-aging and wrinkle reduction, in addition to being a first line cancer therapy in lymphoblastic leukemia. The challenge in ATRA delivery is that the molecules are very hydrophobic, making them water-insoluble, so formulations of ATRA rely on emulsifiers that are greasy and may damage areas of application. This technology introduces a novel, non-greasy formulation to deliver all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for cosmetic applications.\n\nAdvantages: Includes a non-greasy formulation due to water solubility of nanomicelles. Better control of ATRA delivery and reduction of side-effects such as irritation and inflammation. PATRA (PVC-bound ATRA) synthesis is easily scalable. Improved stability of ATRA as the ATRA-bound polymer protects it from light degradation"
MIT,Pre-Stretched & Constrained TransformableTextiles,Case number: #17769,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/pre-stretched-constrained-transformable-textiles,"The presented technology has potential applications in a wide range of textile-based products. Generally speaking, the technology may be applied to textile product production lines as a means to reduce the time and energy required to get the material in the right shape. Specific applications of this include sports clothing and equipment, medical compression garments, furniture and interior products, and consumer clothing.\nThis technology would be primarily of interest to companies that produce textile-based products. This encompasses a broad set of industries, including specialized clothing such as sportswear, furniture, medical equipment, and other consumer goods. Additionally, companies which produce comparatively small quantities of specialized equipment which require a large amount of energy to manipulate the composite material may find this system to be more appealing compared to manual labor and methods more suited to mass production.\n\nTechnology: The presented technology describes a method of shaping textiles by stretching the material and using the potential energy stored in the stretched textile to produce the desired design. First, the chosen textile is stretched in one or more directions and held in place so the energy from the stretch is embedded in the textile. The direction, degree, and uniformity of the stretch vary to produce different designs and shapes, and the type and nature of the textile affects the final transformation. Next, a constraining structure is applied on top of the textile in a precise pattern to promote the correct transformation after the textile is released. The constraint can be applied by either 3D printing, lamination, or material bonding methods.\n\nProblem Addressed: The existing methods for shaping and forming textiles into products all require varying degrees of skill, time, and energy to utilize. Forming, stitching, and detailing are all processes that require very precise actions and controls and are necessary for creating the shape of the desired product. Both manual labor and conventional automated systems need substantial amounts of time and energy to complete these processes and may inflate the price of the product as a result. Furthermore, some products like shoes require dedicated molds that are unique to each design in order to form the textile into the correct shape. Continuously producing and replacing these molds adds a recurring expense to production, as well as increases the cost of creating and producing a new product design.\n\nAdvantages: Can produce 3D shapes and designs without manual stitching, forming, or patching. Saves on energy and time in the production process, does not require specialized skills. Allows for complex, unique designs without expensive molds. Can produce designs from single textile sheets rather than attaching multiple"
MIT,Layer-by-Layer Nanoparticles for Cytokine Therapy in CancerTreatment,Case number: #20027H,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/layer-layer-nanoparticles-cytokine-therapy-cancer,"This nanoparticle technology has applications in cancer immunotherapy.\n\nTechnology: To achieve effective IL12 treatment with reduced side effects these inventors encapsulated IL12 in a nanoparticle using layer-by-layer technology. A liposomal core containing DGS-NTA-Ni is reacted with Histidine on recombinant, single chain IL12 (scIL-12) that contains a C-termininal 6xHIS tag. This liposome-scIL-12 core is then coated with poly(L-arginine) and an outer coating of polyanion using electrostatic interactions between layers. IL12 interacts with an extracellular receptor on immune cells, therefore the nanoparticles must not be internalized and must also be able to interact with the relatively rare immune cell populations. Outer polyanion coatings of either hyaluronic acid or poly(L-glutamic acid) maximize tumor and immune cell association, and nanoparticles with these external layers are able to activate downstream IL12 pathways, namely IFN-y production, in splenocytes. in vitro. , even after the nanoparticles are pre-challenged with tumor cells. Importantly, scIL-12 nanoparticles also display greatly reduced toxicity in vivo compared to soluble IL12. Finally, this technology is highly adaptive and can easily be applied to other cytokines and proteins for delivery or tailored for combination therapy.\n\nProblem Addressed: The immune system has a variety of cell types that can target and kill cells identified as unhealthy. Cancer immunotherapy is a revolutionary new treatment modality that harnesses a patients’ own immune system to target cancer cells. An important step in priming an immune response against cancer is to deliver a general immunostimulatory compound. The cytokine IL12 was an attractive immunostimulatory candidate as it can stimulate both innate and adaptive immune cells, however early clinical trials with IL12 showed that very severe side effects prevent treatment at effective doses. These inventors describe nanoparticle encapsulation of IL12 that significantly reduces the systemic side effects of IL12.\n\nAdvantages: Greatly reduced systemic IL12 toxicity by nanoparticle encapsulation. Optimized immune cell and tumor targeting through choice of polyanion outer layer. Efficient loading of recombinant IL12 (>90%). Adaptable to other cytokines/proteins and combination therapies through straightforward nanoparticle loading"
MIT,"Energy Manipulating Biomaterials by R5 Silicates, Melanins, andMagnetosomes",Case number: #19328,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/energy-manipulating-biomaterials-r5-silicates,"This technology is a novel method for synthesis of silica-based nanomaterials with applications in the medical, optical, energy, and mechanical fields.\n\nTechnology: The inventors have developed novel methods for synthesizing complex silica-based materials, including silica embedded with melanin and silica-based nanostructures and magnetosomes. To generate silica-embedded with melanin, the inventors utilize the R5 peptide, derived from diatoms, to synthesize melanin. This R5-melanin is then used to precipitate silica, resulting in melanin-embedded silica that can be incorporated in hydrogel polymers, bioplastics, fuel cells, and other materials for a wide variety of applications. Importantly, this technology synthesizes silica 90% faster than traditional methods and occurs at ambient temperatures in aqueous conditions.\n\nProblem Addressed: Functional nanostructured materials are of increasing demand in areas including biomedicine, electronics, and energy. In particular, silica-based nanostructured materials have potential to function in a wide variety of applications, ranging from medical devices to plastics to energy storage systems. However, traditional methods of synthesizing these materials have significant time and energy constraints, often requiring overnight reactions, high temperatures, or harsh chemical conditions. Therefore, there remains a need to develop fast and effective methods of synthesizing silica-based nanostructured materials to expand their commercial potential.\n\nAdvantages: 90% faster than existing methods used to synthesize silica-based materials. No energy constraints - synthesis of silica-based structures achieved at ambient temperatures"
MIT,Eye Tracking as a Language ProficiencyTest,Case number: #19689,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/eye-tracking-language-proficiency-test,"This case is related to MIT technology: #19818\nA system that determines foreign language proficiency by tracking gaze during reading has useful application to educational testing services and to language learners around the world. This alternative approach can serve not only as a language evaluation tool but also as a language learning and assessment tool.\n\nTechnology: The developed system determines language proficiency by tracking the gaze of ESL test takers. To determine proficiency, the system relies on an eye tracker camera that records gaze patterns of test takers as they read free-form English sentences and subsequent comprehension questions.\n\nAdvantages: Alternative approach to standardized English testing. Language independent, potential deployment for other languages besides English"
MIT,Method and Apparatus for Message Fractionation and Physical Layer Channel Assignment for Multiuser Detection-Enabled Wireless Communication Among AdaptiveInterference,Case number: #17478L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/method-and-apparatus-message-fractionation-and,"This technology has applications in wireless communications such as 4G/5G cellular systems, WiFi (802.11) and WiMax (802.16), In addition to multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) receivers and signal propagation on cables.\n\nTechnology: The invention is a cognitive coexistence radio which seeks out opportunities to utilize interference to take advantage of the situation as well as the device protocols and available capabilities. By using advanced processing and sensing technology, high throughputs are enabled for its own link and the link with which it simultaneously shares the frequency band. The invention provides a method for overlying or underlaying communications in an established network of rate adaptive nodes. The technology is viable for any number of primary and secondary users on a channel and supports next generation multiuser detection (MUD)-enabled receivers, which can lead to full interference leveraging.  In addition, the method can be applied to MIMO receiver systems and for signals propagating on a cable.\n\nProblem Addressed: The proliferation of wireless technology has resulted in increased network interference. Cognitive networks (intelligent wireless communication systems which perform on-the-fly optimization) are used to control interference by careful selection of the transmission frequencies of secondary users. However, these technologies are designed to avoid interference, rather than use interference to facilitate network transmissions. In addition, existing channel models are insufficient for describing methods for overlaying or underlaying communications in the presence of an already established network of rate adaptive nodes, especially when explicit coordination is prohibited.\n\nAdvantages: Cognitive coexistence radio leverages interference to facilitate communication. Viable for any number of primary and secondary users on a channel. Backward compatible with existing networks. Supports next generation MUDs leading to full interference leveraging"
MIT,3DTV at Home: Eulerian-Lagrangian Stereo-to-Multi-viewConversion,Case number: #19670,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/3dtv-home-eulerian-lagrangian-stereo-multi-view,"This technology has clear potential applications in the consumer electronics industry and market. The technology describes an innovative method for removing the primary inconveniences of home 3D, the need for supplementary glasses, while still allowing for easy implementation on existing and future systems. This may help to counteract the previously lackluster growth of the consumer 3D market by making the product more appealing to potential first-time adopters, as well as demonstrate tangible development to existing users. As such, this technology would be directly relevant to the manufacturers of televisions and other consumer-grade digital devices.\nThis technology would primarily appeal to companies that manufacture 3D televisions currently, or television manufacturers that wish to expand into the 3D market. Beyond this, the technology may also be of interest to manufacturers of tablets, handheld game consoles, and other screen-based consumer electronics.\n\nTechnology: The technology herein describes a method of converting video from its standard “stereo” format to “multiview” content suitable to be used to create 3D effects. The purpose of this conversion is to allow for any media to be viewed on automultiscopic displays in 3D without the need for the glasses required by Stereoscopic 3D methods. The conversion is facilitated by a combination of two rendering approaches, the more traditional Lagrangian approach, and the more recent Eulerian approach.\n\nProblem Addressed: Stereoscopic 3D movies have become much more popular within the cinema market, with many theatres and films offering it as part of their regular lineup. But for all the growth the technology has had in traditional movie theatres, it has lagged severely in the home consumer electronics department. This cannot be directly attributed to the lack of content and accessibility, as many modern TVs and content providers accommodate stereoscopic 3D. Generally, the blame is placed on the glasses that are required to be worn to produce the 3D effect. They are considered to be too much of an inconvenience for the viewer compared to the service they provide. In order to promote further consumer adoption, a 3D technology that does not utilize glasses is necessary, but must still maintain comparable levels of availability.\n\nAdvantages: Allows for multi-angle 3D viewing without the need for supplementary glasses. Robust, higher performance in real-time conversion. Compatible with current graphical hardware, easy implementation"
MIT,New Methods to Assess Fluid Distribution in Muscle Tissue via Single Sided Magnetic ResonanceSensors,Case number: #21335,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/new-methods-assess-fluid-distribution-muscle-tissue,"This invention is a portable and non-invasive magnetic resonance sensor that detects changes in intramuscular fluid volume status during hemodialysis or as a broader indicator of dehydration. This sensor facilitates real-time monitoring of fluid volume in human patients with conditions such as end-stage renal disease, congestive heart failure, and liver failure, to improve treatments and outcomes.\n\nTechnology: This device is a portable magnetic resonance sensor that identifies changes in intramuscular fluid distribution by performing a non-invasive scan of skeletal muscle in the lower leg of human patients. To determine muscle hydration status, a RF excitation signal is emitted from the device. This RF excitation frequency can be tuned to acquire measurements at various tissue depths to enable spatial selection, with shorter RF excitation frequencies localizing measurements to deeper tissues. This sensor measures the multicomponent T2 decay signal produced from the targeted tissue and detects changes in hydration status through fluctuations in amplitude of multicomponent T2-based signal. The presence of subcutaneous fat can confound signals produced by muscle; however, the inventors have developed a diffusion-weighting algorithm to estimate the relative contribution of muscle and fat tissue to the hybrid signal. Thus, the multicomponent T2-based signal corresponding to muscle can be isolated. The magnetic resonance signal produced by muscle changes as a function of hydration status. Therefore, measurements of muscle can be collected over time to detect shifts in tissue fluid distribution with high sensitivity to improve patient outcomes in medical procedures that require removal of excess fluid.\n\nProblem Addressed: Fluid volume overload (hypervolemia) indicates progression of various medical conditions, including end-stage renal disease, congestive heart failure, and liver failure. To remove excess fluid via hemodialysis, clinical staff require accurate measurements of fluid volume to ensure that nonessential fluid is removed, while proper hydration of the patient is maintained. Current methods of evaluating hydration status include measuring blood pressure and body weight, neither of which accurately determine hydration status of muscle, which is the primary fluid reservoir in the body. Without a precise measurement of hydration status, too much fluid may be removed during hemodialysis, leading to intradialytic hypotension. Intradialytic hypotension causes nausea, vomiting, cramping, and chest pain, and, ultimately, can increase the risk of morbidity from bowel ischemia, stroke, and myocardial infarction.\n\nAdvantages: Low cost, high sensitivity platform. Portable, non-invasive device enables ease of use for clinical staff. Provides real-time measurements of intramuscular fluid distribution to improve medical procedures such as hemodialysis"
MIT,Methods and Compositions for Increasing Sensitivity of Cancer Cells to Glutaminase Inhibitors and Applications to CancerTherapy,Case number: #19305,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/methods-and-compositions-increasing-sensitivity,"This technology sensitizes cancer cells to glutaminase inhibitors and has potential therapeutic and theranostic applications in cancer treatment.\n\nTechnology: These inventors found that a primary predictor of response to glutaminase inhibition is expression of the cystine/glutamate antiporter SLC7A11 (also known as xCT). Cells that express high levels of SLC7A11 are exquisitely sensitive to glutaminase inhibition, while those with low levels of SLC7A11 fail to respond. Therefore, SLC7A11 provides a promising theranostic marker for identifying patients that will respond to glutaminase inhibition therapies. Additionally, these inventors demonstrated that increasing levels of SLC7A11 is sufficient to sensitize cancer cells to glutaminase inhibitors. Interestingly, increasing the level of the amino acid dimer cystine (or monomer cysteine) that cancer cells are exposed to can similarly sensitize cancer cells to glutaminase inhibition, as this is a substrate of SLC7A11. Therefore, sensitizing cancer to glutaminase inhibitors by providing exogenous cysteine or SLC7A11 shows exciting potential as a new cancer therapeutic strategy.\n\nProblem Addressed: Cancer cells proliferate much more rapidly than healthy tissues. The increased metabolic demands of such sustained proliferation results in alterations in metabolic pathways. Therapeutic targeting of these metabolic alterations provides an exciting opportunity for developing generalizable cancer treatments. One metabolic pathway of particular interest is glutamine metabolism. Many cancers require glutamine anaplerosis to fuel the TCA cycle, which provides energy and nutrients for proliferation. Drugs targeting glutaminase, an enzyme required for glutamine anaplerosis, have shown promise in. in vivo. animal studies and Phase I/II clinical trials in a variety of cancers including non-small cell lung carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and breast cancer. However, not all cancers are sensitive to glutaminase inhibition, therefore there is a need to sensitize patients to glutaminase inhibition or identify patients that will respond to these drugs.\n\nAdvantages: Theranostic identification of patients sensitive to glutaminase inhibitor therapy. Sensitization to glutaminase inhibitor therapy by activating SLC7A11 or providing cystine"
MIT,Polymers for Selective Heavy MetalRemoval,Case number: #19629,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/polymers-selective-heavy-metal-removal,"The invented polymers are designed for water treatment where there are collections of toxic metals. Used in conjunction with gravity filtration or a carbon block filter, water can be cleansed of both particulate matter and dissolved heavy metals.\n\nTechnology: This cross-linked polymer network captures high volumes of heavy metal ions through soft-soft interactions. These interactions result from the high sulfur content in the branching monomers. Sulfur-containing chains have a high degree of cross-linking which prevents the network from falling apart and ensures no leaching of organics into the water. The network is also designed to have mesoporosity or macroporosity for a high contact surface area with heavy metals, enabling a high rate of filtration. Included in this technology are synthesis methods that create a tri-branched or tetra-branched cross-linker based structure.\n\nProblem Addressed: Heavy metal contamination in water is a major problem in both developed and developing countries. Even low concentrations of mercury and lead pose a serious threat to human health. Past approaches to heavy metal filtration, like ion exchange resins, are either ineffective or highly expensive. A highly efficient, scalable technology with minimal energetic needs for removing heavy metal ions from water would be ideal.\n\nAdvantages: More than 100-fold reduction in Lead concentration from 150 ppb to less than 1 ppb. Selectively chooses heavy metals like Mercury and Lead over common natural ions. Network structure allows dissolution of high concentrations of ions while keeping structural integrity"
MIT,Intracellular Calcium Sensors forMRI,Case number: #20143,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/intracellular-calcium-sensors-mri,"This invention comprises calcium-sensing probes which can be used in clinical diagnostic imaging with functional MRI to perform neuroimaging, muscular and cardiac imaging, and visualization of immunological activation.\n\nProblem Addressed: Calcium ions are central to signal transduction within cells. They coordinate biological processes ranging from embryonic development to neural function. Being able to detect calcium flux within tissues is essential to the accurate evaluation of cellular activity. However, current methods to measure calcium flux within live tissues for clinical diagnostics remains a challenge. While optical probes for intracellular calcium imaging exist, current strategies to monitor intracellular calcium signaling for clinical applications require invasive surgery to achieve greater tissue penetration. Moreover, attempts to achieve optimal tissue penetration noninvasively forgo image resolution. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful technique that can provide the basis for deep-tissue calcium imaging in humans and animals. This invention presents a strategy for real-time monitoring of intracellular calcium levels with functional magnetic resonance imaging using novel manganese-based paramagnetic contrast agents which sense calcium.\n\nAdvantages: Non-invasive method to visualize deep-tissue calcium imaging. High-resolution without sacrificing imaging depth. Enables the application of functional MRI for visualizing intracellular calcium levels for clinical diagnostics"
MIT,Energy HarvestingFootwear,Case number: #19250,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/energy-harvesting-footwear,"This invention allows walking to generate electric energy via a pneumatic motor in the sole of shoes that can be used to power a GPS receiver and manage the location of children, soldiers, the elderly, or anyone wearing the device.\n\nProblem Addressed: Human locomotion typically dissipates large amounts of energy on the order of about 10W to 15W. Prior attempts at harvesting this energy using materials such as piezoelectric materials incorporated into the shoes has only resulted in the ability to harvest about 1 mW to 5 mW. However, during a walking and running test of the proposed device the average power output was 86 mW.\n\nAdvantages: Increases energy harvesting. Ability to follow a person’s geographic location via their footwear"
MIT,Dendrimer Drug Conjugates for Sustained Intra-ArticularDelivery,Case number: #19214,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/dendrimer-drug-conjugates-sustained-intra-articular,"This invention is a drug delivery system for intra-articular injection capable of sustained, targeted delivery to cartilage cells for up to 30 days. It is particularly effective for biologic drugs and/or drugs that target cartilage cells.\n\nTechnology: This technology is an amine terminated polyamidoamine dendrimer (PAMAM) that is conjugated at its terminal groups with an optimal number of polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer chains to govern effective surface charge.  At the selected surface charge, the PEGylated dendrimers are nontoxic and reversibly bind to anionic cartilage tissue in such a way to enable penetration.  A small fraction of the PEG groups have a reactive linker domain that can be used to conjugate a therapeutic protein or small molecule drug to the dendrimer. As a proof of principle, the inventors synthesized optimally PEGylated dendrimers bound to insulin-like growth factor IGF1, a chondrocyte stimulating growth factor previously shown to stimulate cartilage extracellular matrix deposition.  Dendrimer-IGF-1 retains bioactivity equivalent to free IGF-1.  Dendrimer-IGF-1 conjugates display penetration of human thickness cartilage at much greater concentrations than IGF-1 alone. Additionally, the half-life of intra-articular injected dendrimer-IGF-1 is >4 days in an. in vivo. rat model.  In contrast, free IGF-1 has a half-life of less than 0.4 days in the joint. Based on the concentrations injected and these half-lives, dendrimer-IGF-1 provides about 30 days of IGF-1 at therapeutic concentration, whereas free IGF-1 provides about 3 days.  In summary, these inventors have developed a revolutionary drug delivery system that allows sustained, targeted delivery of therapeutics to cartilage cells.\n\nProblem Addressed: For patients with osteoarthritis, there are no disease modifying drugs capable of slowing degeneration or promoting regeneration of cartilage. Current treatment is focused on managing pain for as long as possible until surgery is necessary.  Disease modifying drug candidates have been under clinical development for decades but have repeatedly encountered failure largely due to rapid clearance from the joint.  The dense, avascular cartilage tissue between the joint space and cartilage cells provides another barrier that further compounds this drug delivery challenge in osteoarthritis.  An Amgen sponsored trial of Anakinra, an interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1-RA), provides clinical evidence of the delivery problem (NCT00110916, X. Chevalier et al, Arthritis & Rheumatism, 2009). These inventors have engineered nanoparticle-drug conjugates that can penetrate cartilage to avoid joint clearance and target cartilage cells, extending time at a therapeutic concentration of drug by tenfold.  The improved joint pharmacokinetics offered by this technology could enhance efficacy of disease modifying drugs, thereby improving the chances of clinical success.\n\nAdvantages: Penetration of dendrimer-drug conjugate through human thickness (~ 1 mm) cartilage. Retention of dendrimer in cartilage for up to one month. Sustained delivery of dendrimer-drug conjugate directly to chondrocytes. Capable of accommodating biologic drugs"
MIT,Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide CaptureSystem,Case number: #17422,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/electrochemical-carbon-dioxide-capture-system,"The capture and release of CO2 from a gas mixture, particularly a flue gas, has applications in several contexts, ranging from carbon capture and sequestration for coal-fired power plants, to life-support systems in spacecraft and submarines.\n\nTechnology: The electrochemical amine regeneration (EMAR) process takes place in a cell with two copper chambers that contains a positively-charged anode in one and a negatively-charged cathode in the other. The CO2–amine molecules enter the first chamber in an aqueous solution and come into contact with copper ions released by the charged anode. The copper reacts with the amine, releasing the CO2 in the process. The amine-copper complex then travels to the other chamber where the cathode strips away the copper ions, leaving the amine molecules free to once again capture CO2.\n\nProblem Addressed: CO2 capture is the prerequisite step in CO2 sequestration, a process of transporting waste CO2 and depositing it into storage sites where it cannot enter the atmosphere. This process aims to mitigate the effect of fossil fuels on global warming and ocean acidification. Current CO2 capture technology relies on a thermal cycle, wherein a solvent (usually an amine solution) that can complex dissolved CO2 is heated after capture in a stripper to force the release of gas. That process is energetically inefficient and prohibitively expensive due to large capital investments needed to modify existing power stations.\n\nAdvantages: EMAR system can be used in steam-free environments including cement, steel and aluminum manufacturing plants, which account for 10% of global CO2emissions. System requires only electricity to run, making it easy to retrofit in existing facilities. Removes even low concentrations of CO2 in confined spaces (e.g., submarine, space shuttle)"
MIT,Quantum-Secure Direct Communication and Key Distribution With Broadband Homodyne Reception and ChannelMonitors,Case number: #17763,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/quantum-secure-direct-communication-and-key,"Security in encrypted communication is a top priority because of our highly connected and mobile society’s increasing reliance on the internet, and its attendant remote storage and access capabilities. The Inventors have developed a new protocol for high-speed communication between two parties with security vouchsafed by the laws of quantum physics. The protocol can also be used to distribute cryptographic keys, as in quantum key distribution (QKD) at much higher secure key rates than existing QKD methods.\n\nTechnology: Consider two communicators, Party 1 and Party 2. In this new QI method, Party 1 generates a broadband noise source and sends a small amount to Party 2, who encodes the message on that light using binary phase shift keying. Party 2 then sends the modulated light through an amplifier that helps the message bits overcome transmission losses. The amplifier injects a very significant amount of noise—thousands of times stronger than the message signal strength—that masks the message from a passive eavesdropper. Party 1 receives this noisy signal and combines it with a retained local oscillator (LO) that they derived from the broadband noise source. Homodyne reception allows Party 1 to decode the message at a low bit error rate, while the noise from Party 2’s amplifier precludes the eavesdropper from getting that information because they lack the LO that Party 1 possesses.\n\nProblem Addressed: The highly connected and mobile nature of modern society makes security in encrypted communication a top priority. Quantum illumination (QI) is a common encryption technique that uses multimode entangled light beams to secure communication against a passive eavesdropper, who is allowed to collect all light that is lost in propagation between the two communicating parties. QI faces issues that keep it from being applicable, namely: (1) it is not secure against an active attack in which an eavesdropper injects their own light into the sender to learn about the message; (2) its protocol has limitations on its secure data rate and on the distance between the sender and receiver. The Inventors have developed a new approach that overcomes these barriers and provides for much higher secure communication rates with longer distances.\n\nAdvantages: Commercial off-the-shelf components for easy implementation. Broadband LO can be amplified to allow long-distance transmission without degradation. Homodyne reception with broadband LO does not have data bandwidth limitation; i.e. the new configuration can provide secure transmission at rates 2-4 orders of magnitude better than existing methods.

MIT,Sub-Nanosecond Time of Flight on Commercial Wi-FiCards,Case number: #17746,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/sub-nanosecond-time-flight-commercial-wi-fi-cards,"This invention is a system that measures the time-of-flight to sub-nanosecond accuracy on commercial Wi-Fi cards. This technology has applications in device-to-device localization (i.e. enabling a pair of Wi-Fi devices to locate each other) as well as in major positioning systems including GPS, RADAR and SONAR.\n\nTechnology: The Inventors’ approach is based on the observation that a very wideband radio (e.g., a few GHz) can allow time-of-flight measurement at sub-nanosecond accuracy. While each Wi-Fi frequency band is only tens of Megahertz wide, there are many such bands that together span a very wide bandwidth. Their solution therefore collects measurements on multiple Wi-Fi frequency bands and stitches them together to give the illusion of a wide-band radio. Their key contribution is an algorithm that achieves this, despite the fact that Wi-Fi frequency bands are non-contiguous, and in some cases, a few Gigahertz apart.\n\nProblem Addressed: Time-of-flight is the time incurred by a signal to travel from transmitter to receiver and is a highly intuitive way to measure distances using wireless signals. However, attempts at using time-of-flight for indoor localization are not accurate due to fundamental limitations in measuring time on Wi-Fi and other RF consumer technologies. Alternative methods for RF-based indoor localization do not support indoor positioning between a pair of Wi-Fi devices without third party support. The Inventors have designed a set of algorithms to overcome the above limitations and measure the time-of-flight at sub-nanosecond accuracy using off-the-shelf Wi-Fi cards. This system, called Chronos, achieves accurate device-to-device localization without any support from the infrastructure, including the location of access points.\n\nAdvantages: Chronos is the first RF-based positioning system that can measure sub-nanosecond time of flight on commercial Wi-Fi cards, estimating device-to-device distance measurements without any infrastructure support.. System operates on typical 2/3-antenna Wi-Fi receivers yet delivers state-of-the-art localization accuracy."
MIT,"""Modal Images"" (Image-Space Modal Analysis of Deformations for VideoSynthesis)",Case number: #17732,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/modal-images-image-space-modal-analysis-deformations,"The Inventors have developed an image-space modal analysis of small deformations in video. This allows users to interactively apply new forces to a recorded object and see it respond via real-time physical animations. This technology can be used in various video synthesis endeavors, for example to perform motion magnification in vision and graphics applications, or to conduct structural analysis in civil engineering applications.\n\nTechnology: The Inventors apply techniques from 3D physical simulation and structural analysis to the task of video synthesis. Small deformations of most solid objects can be well-approximated with linear modal analysis. The Inventors show that by applying this analysis to small deformations captured in video they can extract projections of an object’s deformation modes and use these projections as a basis for the image-space simulation of that object’s dynamics.\n\nProblem Addressed: Image and video are easy to capture and provide an accurate depiction of our immediate surroundings. However, they lack the interactivity and physical realism that is possible with virtual environments. The Inventors show that some of the structural information available to 3D simulations can be observed in videos and used to synthesize physically plausible dynamics directly in image space without prior knowledge of scene geometry.\n\nAdvantages: Minimal user input required to synthesize physically plausible object motion simulations"
MIT,Highly Parallel Enzymatic DNA Synthesis Using Electrowetting DropletTechnology,Case number: #19620,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/highly-parallel-enzymatic-dna-synthesis-using,"This technology is a method for synthesizing nucleic acids and other biopolymers without the use of a template. More specifically, this method is a highly parallel enzymatic synthesis of biopolymers on a microfluidic device. This technology has implications in DNA-based memory and RNA and DNA-based vaccine products.\n\nTechnology: This technology is a method to synthesize nucleic acids in the absence of a template on a microfluidic chip. The microfluidic chip is comprised of fluid reservoirs containing: component building blocks (one for each of the nucleobases found in DNA) in suitable buffers such as physiological saline; the enzyme catalyst Tdt; and an initiation sequence (e.g., ssDNA sequence > 2 nucleotides) that contains a recognition site for TdT. To achieve nucleic acid synthesis on the microfluidic chip:\n\nProblem Addressed: The two major approaches to DNA synthesis are chemical synthesis using phosphoramidite and enzymatic synthesis using Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT). Chemical synthesis using phosphoramidite though a highly efficient technology is still relatively limited in the length of nucleotides they are able to synthesize (< 300 nucleotides in length). Enzymatic synthesis using TdT which is often used as an alternative to phosphoramidite, is a template-free method that works by affixing to an initiator and then initializing polymerization. However, this method is often less controlled compared to methods using phosphonamidite, which are able to add nucleotides in a more controlled step-wise manner.\n\nAdvantages: Multiple ways to control movement of droplets – temperature and magnetic methods can be incorporated on the dielectric chip for synthesis."
MIT,Methods for Gene Delivery withPapillomaviruses,Case number: #21704,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/methods-gene-delivery-papillomaviruses,"This technology is a novel biological vector for the delivery of gene editing material to nucleic acid targets. This technology has implications that include cellular engineering, therapeutics, and biological research.\n\nTechnology: This technology comprises a papillomaviral delivery vehicle. The papillomaviral delivery vehicle comprises an HPV-derived capsid encapsulating a gene editing material.  This method also provides the ability to edit a polynucleotide target in a cell using the papillomaviral delivery vehicle. The method includes:\n\nProblem Addressed: Emerging genome techniques now allow for more precise modification, therefore creating new possibilities for gene therapy. Currently, the main barrier of genome editing constructs from research settings to clinical trials is their safe and effective delivery to targeted tissues. An example of a delivery vehicle of choice for gene editing material is viral vectors. However, the complexity of their production, limited packaging capability, and limited immunogenicity restrict their application in gene therapy. The current technology employs a delivery vehicle using an HPV derived capsid that allows for increased payload size while reducing the complexity and cost of production.\n\nAdvantages: A wide array of gene editing material encapsulated in the HPV derived capsid vector can be used.. HPV delivery system can elude the host immune system, therefore increasing the range of tissues and cell types that can be targeted (i.e., astrocytes, hematopoietic stem cells, esenchymal progenitor cell, muscle cell, retinal cell).. Allows In vivo cellular engineering for constructs up to 8 kb.. HPV capsids can be modified to enhance transduction efficiency."
MIT,Procedural Sedation Monitoring: Systems and Methods for Predicting Adverse Events and Assesing Level ofSedation,Case number: #17704J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/procedural-sedation-monitoring-systems-and-methods,"This invention is a system for monitoring sedation state and detecting adverse events during procedural sedation. The system can be implemented in a standalone monitor or incorporated into commercially available monitoring systems within clinical settings.\n\nTechnology: Following the 2011 guidelines of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, capnography, a noninvasive measurement of exhaled carbon dioxide, has become the standard of care for ventilation monitoring of sedated patients. This invention quantitatively identifies a patient's sedation level and predicts adverse events based on information from the capnogram and outputs from pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics or ventilatory models. This system is comprised of a breath receiver, a sensor and a processor. The sensor measures the carbon dioxide concentration of air exhaled by the patient into the breath receiver. The processor processes the sensor data to generate capnograms, and computes the outputs of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and ventilatory models. The processor also extracts the resulting features from these models and a multi-parameter metric is computed based on the extracted features to determine the current or predicted sedation level of the patient.  Assessing an individual's ventilatory state during sedation provides a unique perspective on patient's clinical status. In particular, parameter extraction and predictive methods derived from capnography and other physiological data can improve the safety and operational effectiveness of the sedation.\n\nAdvantages: Respiratory-focused patient monitoring system. Helps reduce subjectivity from clinical decision making with respect to individual sedation and respiratory state. Predicts adverse respiratory events"
MIT,"Compounds, Targets and Pathways for MacrophageModulation",Case number: #22081,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/compounds-targets-and-pathways-macrophage-modulation,"This technology can be used to identify modulators of macrophages for disease intervention. Macrophages are a key class of phagocytic cells, which engulf and degrade dying cells and invading bacteria and viruses. The dysregulation of macrophages has been implicated in contributing to numerous human diseases. By identifying modulators that activate macrophages, these macrophages can be “re-programmed” to treat such diseases.\n\nTechnology: The invention uses a combination of phenotypic screening and transcriptional analysis to identify compounds and their mechanism of action in macrophage activation for new therapies.\n\nProblem Addressed: A remarkable feature of macrophages is their plasticity, which is the ability to respond to local stimuli to acquire different phenotypes and functions. However, once macrophages adapt to certain microenvironments, the macrophages can end up suppressing immune responses and promote unwanted or harmful growth of other cells. The methods in this invention identify biochemical compounds that can re-program macrophage phenotype and function, which in turn can be used to develop novel therapies for many cancer, metabolic, and infectious diseases.\n\nAdvantages: Macrophages can acquire different phenotypes and functions to respond to changing physiological needs, while other therapeutic methods may lack this plasticity. Macrophages are found in nearly all stages of development, from the fetus through adult life. Macrophages are well dispersed in the body and efficiently infiltrate immune cells in certain microenvironments"
MIT,Novel Peptidic Agents for Targeting Chemoresistant Anti-ApoptoticMcl-1,Case number: #17695J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/novel-peptidic-agents-targeting-chemoresistant-anti,"Structurally stabilized Mcl-1-binding peptides may be useful in treating a variety of chemotherapy-resistant cancers such as adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\n\nTechnology: Mcl-1, along with other members of the Bcl-2 family, blocks apoptosis by binding to short helices in pro-apoptotic proteins, inhibiting their homo-oligomerization and activation. This interaction can be prevented by blocking the binding site on Mcl-1.MS1 is a synthetic peptide that binds Mcl-1 with high affinity and selectively induces mitochondrial permeabilization (MOMP) in Mcl-1-dependent cancer cells. However, as MS1 is a short peptide, it is less stable than a small molecule, unable to penetrate the cell membrane, and susceptible to proteases. MS1 and related peptides that bind Mcl-1 can be stabilized by cross-linking them with hydrocarbon groups optimized to confer protease resistance and enable cellular uptake. This “hydrocarbon stapling” process was used to generate a stapled analog—MS1SAHBc—that exhibits improved binding and helicity, the latter indicative of protease resistance and cell entry capability.\n\nProblem Addressed: Mcl-1 is an oncogene that is overexpressed in many cancers and confers resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Mcl-1 belongs to a family of anti-apoptotic proteins with homology to B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Inhibition of Mcl-1 and related proteins using potent, selectively binding small molecules is a promising avenue for therapy; however, no such small molecule has been identified for Mcl-1. Synthetic peptides designed to selectively target Mcl-1 are an alternative to small molecules. Such peptides can be structurally modified via “hydrocarbon stapling” to confer stability and promote cell entry, making them candidates for development as cancer therapeutics.\n\nAdvantages: High binding specificity to Mcl-1. Protease resistant. Able to pass through the cell membrane"
MIT,Non-Invasive Assessment of Venous Pressure via Actuation of Reciprocal Surface Forces for Vessel Collapse Using Single-Crystal Ultrasound inVertebrates,Case number: #19192QJ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/non-invasive-assessment-venous-pressure-actuation,"This device for assessing vascular health has potential clinical applications in monitoring edema as seen in heart disease, detecting dehydration, and assisting with finding thromboembolisms or other vascular pathologies. It is portable, low-cost, and non-invasive, making it suitable for use in human hospitals, urgent care settings, outpatient clinics, and veterinary medicine.\n\nTechnology: This is a medical device to non-invasively assess a patient’s CVP via venous pressure, as a means of monitoring IVV. The device utilizes a single-crystal transducer to transmit ultrasound pulses through the patient’s tissue to the walls of the target vein. It then records the reflected ultrasound pulses to measure the dimensions of the target vein while minimizing signal noise. This device also utilizes a sensitive load cell to accurately measure the force it takes to collapse the target vein while accounting for the compression of skin tissue. Finally, the device combines these measurements to accurately calculate and quickly display the patient’s CVP.\n\nProblem Addressed: Intravascular volume (IVV), the fluid within the circulatory system, is a clinically-significant indicator of both vascular and tissue health. An imbalance in IVV can be indicative of health disorders such as edema, acute fluid loss from diarrhea, or hypertension. Central venous pressure (CVP), the pressure of blood in the thoracic vena cava, is the clinical gold standard measurement of IVV, and right heart catheterization is the typical measurement technique. Unfortunately, this technique is invasive, and it requires expensive equipment and training. Clinicians also use external jugular venous pressure assessment to estimate CVP; however, this method is subjective and highly user-dependent. There is a need for a device, such as this, that is capable of reliably and non-invasively measuring CVP in order to elucidate a patient’s IVV status and guide clinical therapeutic paradigms.\n\nAdvantages: Non-invasive. Small, portable, and low-cost. Ability to measure very low venous pressures. Ability to be used on any accessible vein, including the internal jugular vein. Possibility to create a wearable form of this device for continuous monitoring of venous pressure"
MIT,Nitroxide-Based Macromolecular Contrast Agents with Unprecedented Transverse Relaxivity and Stability for Magnetic Resonance Imaging ofTumors,Case number: #19540J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/nitroxide-based-macromolecular-contrast-agents,"This technology is a nitroxide-based MRI negative-contrast agent with applications in tumor imaging.\n\nTechnology: This technology is a nitroxide-based brush-arm star polymer organic radial contrast agent (BASP-ORCA). Nitroxide ORCAs have previously been suggested to have potential as a contrast agent. However, nitroxide ORCAs in monomer form are very rapidly reduced to non-functional derivatives. in vivo. , and they suffer from low proton relaxivity as they possess only one unpaired electron. BASP-ORCAs are polymeric macromolecules that consist of a polyacetal core, many polyethylene glycol (PEG) arms extending from the central core, and a nitroxide group attached at the interface between the core and the PEG arms creating a dense nitroxide layer. This design both protects the nitroxide groups from reduction and overcomes the low relaxivity of nitroxide monomers by including many nitroxide units, thereby increasing the number of unpaired electrons. Nanoparticles between 10nm and 200nm have been previously demonstrated to accumulate in tumors. BASP-ORCA particles are of an ideal size for tumor accumulation, and indeed BASP-ORCA particles build up in tumors in. in vivo. mouse tumor transplant models (both subcutaneous and orthotopic models). BASP-ORCA injected intravenously into mice additionally displays clinically relevant circulation half-life, has very low toxicity, and provides negative-contrast enhancement on par with metal-based contrast agents. Finally, other imaging agents and/or drug molecules can be concurrently incorporated into the BASP-ORCA alongside of nitroxides, which provides an additional imaging modality such as IR fluorescence imaging of tumors or combined imaging and therapy strategies.\n\nProblem Addressed: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is among the most popular and useful diagnostic imaging tools due to its ability to generate high-resolution three-dimensional images without the use of ionizing radiation. The usefulness of MRI as a diagnostic relies on the ability to distinguish healthy and diseased tissue, however, this can often be challenging, particularly in small tumors. Therefore, contrast agents are commonly used to enhance tissue imaging. Currently approved contrast agents are metal-based, and often have significant toxicity concerns. Additionally, lower toxicity metal-free contrast agents have thus far proven to suffer from low sensitivity, short. in vivo. half-lives, and the need for very high concentrations of contrast agent. Due to these shortcomings non-metal-based contrast agents have not been clinically adopted. These inventors have built nitroxide nanoparticles that overcome many of the current challenges in metal-free contrast agents.\n\nAdvantages: Metal-free T2 negative-contrast agent for MRI imaging of tumors. Tumor homing BASP-ORCA particles allow specific tumor contrast enhancement. Increases. in vivo. half-life of nitroxide by protecting from rapid reduction reaction. High relaxivity and effective contrast enhancement through incorporation of many nitroxide groups into each BASP-ORCA nanoparticle. Multimodal imaging through addition of IR fluorescence functional groups"
MIT,Solid-State Activation of Li202 Oxidation Kinetics and Implications for Li-O2Batteries,Case number: #17675J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/solid-state-activation-li202-oxidation-kinetics-and,"Transition metal nanoparticles can enhance oxidation kinetics in rechargeable lithium-air batteries. This technology has application for industries that require high-energy density battery systems, such as the electric vehicle industry.\n\nTechnology: This technology uses transition metals to promote the generation of oxygen involved in Li2O2 oxidation. Use of transition metals as catalytic material can improve stability, cycling, and efficiency of electrochemical systems. The catalytic material can include nanoparticles or other compositions of molybdenum (Mo), chromium (Cr), or their oxides for use in electrodes. Use of these transition metals as promoters in Li2O2 oxidation kinetics can lower charging potentials and enhance efficiency of lithium-air batteries.\n\nProblem Addressed: Existing lithium-air battery designs suffer from slow charge/recharge rates due to poor oxidation kinetics of Li2O2 formed upon discharge of the electrochemical system. This requires large voltages for Li2O2 oxidation to occur and results in low roundtrip efficiencies of rechargeable lithium-air batteries. In addressing the slow fundamental kinetics of recharge, this technology employs transition metals to serve as catalytic materials.\n\nAdvantages: Enhanced efficiency of lithium-air batteries. Lower recharge potentials. Use of catalytic materials free of expensive precious metals or their oxides"
MIT,Removal of Ruthenium-Initiator from Brush-Arm Star Polymers (BASPs) via Core-to-Surface Ring-Opening Methathesis Polymerization(ROMP),Case number: #19525,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/removal-ruthenium-initiator-brush-arm-star-polymers,"This technology is an improved method for manufacturing nanoparticles that has applications as a research tool or therapeutic drug delivery platform.\n\nTechnology: BASP nanoparticles are typically assembled in two steps. First, bottlebrush-like structures with many polymer arms are synthesized using ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) with a ruthenium initiator. Second, many bottlebrushes are crosslinked to form the nanoparticle structure. This technology adds a third step that simultaneously adds additional polymer arms to the nanoparticle thus providing a way to greatly improve the drug loading and functionality of BASPs. These improved BASP-out nanoparticles can be easily loaded with therapeutic drugs or imaging agents, and the inventors demonstrated highly efficient uptake of fluorophore labeled BASP-out nanoparticles into human cancer cells. in vitro. as well as outstanding efficacy and safety profiles. in vivo. .\n\nProblem Addressed: Small (<30 nm) nanoparticles are promising drug delivery carriers for cancer therapy. Brush arm star polymer (BASP) nanoparticles are simple to assemble and customize.

MIT,An E-Toll Transponder Network for SmartCities,Case number: #17673,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/e-toll-transponder-network-smart-cities,"The inventors have developed Caraoke, a networked system for delivering smart services using existing e-toll transponders. Caraoke presents a new reader design that can count, localize, and estimate the speed of the cars on the road using collision signals from their e-toll transponders.\n\nTechnology: Caraoke presents a new reader design that can count, localize and estimate the speed of cars on the road using collusion signals from their e-toll transponders. The key feature that enables Caraoke to work in the presence of collision is its ability to exploit the transponders’ carrier frequency offset (CFO) as RFID devices. The Inventors consider the collision in the frequency domain as opposed to the time domain, and show that each collision exhibits spikes that correspond to the CFO of the colliding transponders. Further, e-toll transponders have particularly large CFOs that span 1.2HMz, creating a significant separation between the spikes. Thus, they can estimate the number of transponders by counting these spikes.\n\nProblem Addressed: Electric toll collection transponders (e.g. E-ZPass) are simple devices consisting of a battery-powered RFID. They are perhaps among the most-widely used wireless communication technologies. There is a big opportunity for using e-toll transponders to enable smart cities, for example by deploying readers on traffic lights that query the transponders and track the number of cars at every intersection. Unfortunately, e-toll transponders are designed under the assumption that only one transponder transmits at any point in time, and hence have no MAC protocol to prevent collisions. Replacing the large infrastructure of deployed transponders to support a MAC protocol would be time and cost prohibitive. The Inventors have developed Caraoke, a system that exploits the structure of the existing e-toll transponder signal and its properties in the frequency domain to deliver smart services.\n\nAdvantages: Small and low-cost device amenable to large-scale deployment. Caraoke is built into a custom designed printed circuit board (PCB) and connects to the Internet via an LTF modem; energy harvested from solar power, making it easy to deploy on streetlamps"
MIT,Sequence-Defined ChiralPoly(triazoles),Case number: #17658,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/sequence-defined-chiral-polytriazoles,"This technology is a method of efficiently synthesizing sequence-defined synthetic polymers with applications in materials science and chemical engineering.\n\nTechnology: This technology uses an iterative exponential growth technique to produce pure synthetic polymers with high efficiency. The monomers are designed to have two protected, orthogonal linking groups separated by an internal functional group. Once de-protected, the linking groups react to link the monomers in the correct orientation. Rather than adding monomer one at a time, the protected linking groups can be selectively de-protected to link n-mers in an exponential fashion (ex. 2-mer, 4-mer, 16-mer). The highly efficient linking reactions combined with the exponential growth scheme means that large synthetic polymers can be built quickly and efficiently. Importantly, the reactions can be structured so that the identity and chirality of the functional groups can be precisely ordered, which was previously only possible using laborious sequential polymer synthesis.\n\nProblem Addressed: Biopolymers, such as DNA and protein, perform complex molecular functions in nature. Inspired by these natural compounds, chemists have long sought to create functional synthetic polymers. However, making large synthetic polymers remains challenging. Bulk polymer synthesis reactions result in polydisperse solutions that contain polymer with various lengths and chirality. Templated or iterative monomer additions can give rise to a synthetic polymer of defined identity, but these synthesis techniques require huge numbers of sequential reactions to produce relatively small synthetic polymers. This technology is a new, highly efficient, method for synthesizing sequence specific synthetic polymers.\n\nAdvantages: Highly efficient synthesis of synthetic polymers. Customizable sequence of functional group identity and chirality along the entire polymer"
MIT,Sensitization of Bacterial Cells to Quinolone Antibiotic by Restoring High Energy ProducingMetabolism,Case number: #20096,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/sensitization-bacterial-cells-quinolone-antibiotic,"This technology is a strategy for sensitizing bacteria to quinolone family antibiotics that has applications in therapeutic antibiotic regimens.\n\nTechnology: Quinolone treatment targets topoisomerases involved in DNA replication, however the metabolic state of bacteria can also affect quinolone sensitivity. In fact, bacteria are able to evade the killing effects of quinolones while in a metabolically lowered state due to oxygen and sugar shortage, as is common in high-density infections. These inventors are able to re-sensitize bacteria in this metabolically low state to quinolone treatment by providing fumarate as an alternative to oxygen as the terminal electron receptor in the electron transport chain.\n\nProblem Addressed: Antibiotics are a critically important arsenal against bacteria and are indispensable in modern medicine. In recent years, antibiotic resistance has risen to dangerously high levels, leading to strains of bacteria that do not respond to antibiotics. Quinolones are a family of antibiotics commonly used to treat bacteria that have become resistant to first-line antibiotics. However, bacteria can also rapidly become resistant to quinolone therapy. Bacteria with metabolic exhaustion are often not killed by quinolone treatment, and this persistence has been identified as a state that promotes development of quinolone resistance. These inventors describe a strategy for sensitizing these metabolically exhausted bacteria to quinolone therapy.\n\nAdvantages: Sensitization of bacteria to quinolone antibiotics. Potential therapeutic technique to increase efficacy and decrease resistance to quinolone antibiotics"

Quantum magnetometry enables other applications such as nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, object detection and tracking, and navigation.\n\nTechnology: A single-chip spin-control/detection system using standard CMOS processes is implemented to address the problem of scalability. Through a tightly-integrated microwave launcher, photonic filter, and sensor, the CMOS circuits offer more direct physical interactions with the quantum states, rather than being used as simple electronic I/O modules. This enables ultra-compact and highly scalable platforms for room-temperature quantum sensing and information processing under cryogenic conditions .

In addition, NV centers have been investigated for quantum information processing application. However, NV-based  platforms require bulky and discrete instruments to control and measure spin states, which makes them impractical and difficult to scale up.

MIT,Switchable Superconducting Josephson Junction Device for Low Energy Information Storage andProcessing,Case number: #19854,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/switchable-superconducting-josephson-junction-device,"Exchange field junctions enables supercurrent found in field sensors (both magnetic and electric), measurement standards, or in quantum computing.\n\nTechnology: The exchange field based junction consists of an alternating superconductor (SC) and ferromagnetic insulator (FI) multilayer in the order SC/FI/SC/FI. Due to IEF, the upper part of the device can operate as a Josephson junction when the two ferromagnets are magnetized antiparallel. However, in the case of parallel magnetization, the structure suppresses superconductivity resulting in significantly decreased current for a millivolt bias. This binary system is both nonvolatile and observable as an enormous change in device resistance. The conductive state is controlled by the relative magnetization orientation of the neighboring ferromagnetic insulators. Magnetization orientation can be set with a topological insulator and a high atomic number layer. A gate voltage is applied between the topological insulator and the high atomic number layer, causing a change in the ferromagnetic layer through spin-orbit-coupling.\n\nProblem Addressed: Spin-electronic (spintronics) memory uses electron spin for logic and sensing. Heat loss from associated charge currents limits the potential applications in computing technology. Superconducting electronics do not rely on spin and offer a loss-less alternative with significantly higher clock speeds. The Josephson junction is a versatile superconducting device that uses Interfacial Exchange Field (IEF) from ferromagnetic insulators to control conventional superconductivity. For standard von Neumann architectures, memory and logic are separated, thus adding to computation time. The presented technology integrates a nonvolatile memory and readout in the same structure at ultralow power and ultrafast computation time.\n\nAdvantages: Integration of memory and readout decrease computation time and increase processing speeds. Josephson junctions have no power dissipation so energy and operation costs are saved. Made by sputtering technique so design is easily scalable into an ultra-dense array"
MIT,Printable Hydraulics: A Method for Fabricating Actuated 3D-Printed Assemblies via Co-Deposition of Solids andLiquids,Case number: #18254,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/printable-hydraulics-method-fabricating-actuated-3d,"This technology is a novel multi-material 3D printing process for fabricating functional robots using 3D inkjet-based printers. This new printing capability enables complex hydraulically actuated robots and robotic components to be automatically built, with no assembly required, which allows for the fabrication of complex actuated structures that, assembled manually, would be inconvenient or impossible to produce.\n\nTechnology: Printable Hydraulics is a novel fabrication process that simultaneously prints solid and liquid materials, depositing both photopolymers and a non-curing liquid concurrently to fabricate complex, pre-filled fluidic channels. The printable hydraulic parts are functional, hydraulically actuated assemblies that employ non-solidifying liquids as a force-transmitting component. These parts are printed in a single step using a multi-material inkjet printer that simultaneously fabricates solid and liquid regions within a structure. The printer deposits individual droplets of material in a layer-by-layer build process, wherein individual layers can contain one or more material types. Solids with varying stiffness are used to modulate the flexibility of various portions, enabling prescribed strain in response to applied fluid pressure. Supporting layers are provided either via removable curing support material or by non-curing liquid.\n\nProblem Addressed: Building robots is a time-consuming process as multiple discrete materials with long assembly times must be assembled sequentially. The mass-production of robots is impractical due to the costs of repeated design iterations and optimization steps. Multi-material additive manufacturing techniques, such as 3D printing, have emerged as a compelling method to fabricate robots. This approach allows materials with diverse mechanical properties to be placed at arbitrary locations within a structure, enabling the rapid fabrication of multi-part design iterations. The Inventors have developed one such multi-material 3D printing process that can fabricate functional, hydraulically actuated robotic structures in a single step.\n\nAdvantages: Solid and fluid regions are fabricated together, dramatically reducing fabrication times. Process enables complex geometries that are infeasible with other 3D printing methods. Simple control of complex hydraulic assemblies, relative to systems based on pneumatics.

MIT,Glycan-Binding Proteins and Related Compositions andMethods,Case number: #21107,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/glycan-binding-proteins-and-related-compositions-and,"The inventors have engineered proteins for detection and manipulation of carbohydrates and carbohydrate-containing biomolecules with applications in basic glycoscience research, diagnostics, and therapeutics.\n\nTechnology: The inventors have engineered proteins capable of recognizing carbohydrate epitopes for use as antibody and lectin alternatives. Using directed evolution, the inventors engineered small DNA-binding proteins to tightly bind and specifically recognize targeted monosaccharides, disaccharides and more complex carbohydrates. These proteins are highly thermostable, small enough to recognize single-atom differences between sugars, and do not face the steric hindrance challenges of antibodies and lectins. Importantly, multiple glycan-binding proteins can be assembled together to form customized reagents for recognition and manipulation of complex oligosaccharide structures. These engineered glycan-binding proteins can be easily functionalized and can substitute for antibodies in a wide range of immunological or diagnostic techniques, including flow cytometry and histology for cells expressing a glycosylated biomolecule of interest. Furthermore, these proteins can be utilized in microarray-based detection methods or for affinity purification of specific glycosylated biomolecules. In summary, these engineered glycan-binding proteins enable recognition and manipulation of carbohydrates of user interest, regardless of size and composition, with greater specificity and affinity than currently existing tools.\n\nProblem Addressed: Glycans are ubiquitous and essential biomolecules with diverse biological functions, including maintenance of cell structure, signal transduction, and cellular interactions. Furthermore, aberrant glycosylation is implicated in a wide range of human diseases, such as cancer, neuronal disease, and diabetes. However, further progress in glycan-related research and therapeutic application is significantly limited by the lack of analytical tools capable of recognizing these structurally diverse biomolecules with high affinity and specificity. Glycans are poorly immunogenic, hindering development of highly selective anti-glycan antibodies. Lectins have been used for recognition and purification of glycosylated biomolecules, but lectins have a very limited epitope range and modest affinity for carbohydrates. Therefore, there exists a strong need to develop reagents capable of binding glycans with high specificity and affinity.\n\nAdvantages: Engineered glycan-binding proteins capable of recognizing a wide range of carbohydrates, regardless of size or composition, with greater specificity and affinity than antibodies and lectins. Capable of detecting single-atom differences between carbohydrates, and not sterically hindered due to their small sizes. Multiple glycan-binding proteins can be linked to specifically recognize and manipulate very complex oligosaccharide structures. Can be easily functionalized for a broad range of biological techniques, including immunostaining and purification of glycosylated biomolecules and cells."
MIT,Magnetic Nanodiscs Mediate Remote Magnetomechanical Control of NeuralCalcium,Case number: #20085,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/magnetic-nanodiscs-mediate-remote-magnetomechanical,"This technology enables the transgene-free control of cellular calcium flux for applications in neurobiology research.\n\nTechnology: This technology employs biocompatible anisotropic magnetite magnetic nanodiscs (MNDs) that, when exposed to low-magnitude magnetic fields, induce changes in cellular membrane tension to activate ion channels. When the MNDs are incubated with cells such as dorsal root ganglia explants, they form an interface with the surface of cell membranes. When a low-frequency, low-amplitude magnetic field is then applied to the cell culture, the MNDs transduce the magnetic field into magnetic force. The magnetic force exerted from the MNDs creates membrane tension via torque and is sufficient to activate mechanosensitive channels such as calcium channels. Thus, this technology achieves the precise modulation of calcium flux in neurons and other mechanosensory cells in a minimally invasive manner without the use of transgenes.\n\nProblem Addressed: The use of magnetic fields for the minimally invasive control of cell signaling molecules, such as calcium, is gaining recognition as an approach to studying the nervous system and mechanosensitive cell biology. In fact, wireless strategies using high-frequency alternating magnetic fields to heat magnetic nanoparticles have already been demonstrated to permit the regulation of neural activity in vivo. However, the off-target effects of magnetothermal approaches, including cellular damage, and the challenges in scaling high-frequency alternating magnetic field apparatuses are obstacles to the widespread adoption of these strategies in biomedical applications. Therefore, there is a need for scalable magnetic devices that can be used in conjunction with lower-frequency magnetic fields to control and study cellular activity and signaling without compromising cellular viability. The present invention is a novel method and device that provides remote magnetomechanical control of mechanosensitive cells to regulate calcium flux utilizing low-frequency magnetic fields and magnetic nanodiscs.\n\nAdvantages: Capable large-volume cellular calcium modulation without the use of transgenes. Inexpensive to implement - uses off-the-shelf materials. No need for heating magnetic particles, which can reduce cellular viability"
MIT,Streptococcus Canis Cas9 for Tunable Genome Engineering andRegulation,Case number: #19757XTE,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/streptococcus-canis-cas9-tunable-genome-engineering,"This technology is a novel Cas9 variant with applications as a research tool in gene editing.\n\nTechnology: This technology uses Cas9 from the bacteria. Streptococcus canis. (ScCas9) to recognize the PAM sequence NNGT instead of the NGG PAM recognized by the commonly used. S. pyogenes. Cas9 (SpCas9). This PAM sequence is entirely novel and is not recognized by any previously identified Cas9 variants. The amino acid sequence of ScCas9 is highly homologous to SpCas9, differing significantly only in two regions known to play a role in DNA interaction and PAM spacing. Importantly, ScCas9 can be used to efficiently edit DNA in mammalian cells and can be simply integrated into existing Cas9 platforms since it uses the same sgRNA sequences as SpCas9.\n\nProblem Addressed: The CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized genome editing. However, the range of sequences targetable with Cas9 is currently limited by the need for a defined DNA sequence, called a PAM, immediately following the target region. The strict PAM requirements make very precise amino acid changes difficult and makes editing some DNA stretches nearly impossible. Recent work has expanded the panel of PAM sequences available to researchers, but there remains a need to develop Cas9 variants with expanded PAM specificities.\n\nAdvantages: Cas9 variant with novel NNGT PAM recognition sequence. Increases the number of DNA sequences that can be targeted with Cas9 gene editing. Simple integration into established Cas9 platforms using same guide RNA sequences. Demonstrated efficiency in mammalian cells"
MIT,RNA-Based Regulatory Technologies for Improved miRNASensors,Case number: #19686,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/rna-based-regulatory-technologies-improved-mirna,"This technology is a miRNA guided circuit to sense cellular biomarkers that improves upon current circuit technologies and has applications in cellular therapeutics and research.\n\nTechnology: The first technology is a system in which a DNA launched self-replicating RNA replicon (DREP) is used to increase the signal robustness of a miRNA circuit. In this circuit design, a transcription factor drives expression of a DREP replicon which contains the output. Additionally, the DREP replicon can be negatively regulated by expression of the nuclease Csy4. In order for the output to be expressed the miRNA which targets the transcription factor and output sequences must not be expressed. Additionally, a second miRNA must be expressed at high levels to repress the negative regulator Csy4. This is an improvement over traditional miRNA circuits because in traditional expression systems circuit function is directly related to how much DNA payload a given cell received. However, by using a self-replicating output the robustness of the system is greatly increased in cells that received even low levels of the output replicon. Additionally, including the negative regulator Csy4 ensures very low levels of background activation by destroying the output DREP replicon.\n\nProblem Addressed: Sensing cellular biomarkers to drive a desired output allows cells to be used as miniature computational circuits. These cellular circuits can be used to generate outputs such as identifying the cell of interest with a marker, producing a desired secreted protein, or having a therapeutic effect only in cells that meet all of the circuit requirements. For example, sensing cell-type can allow for targeted killing of cancer cells that express particular markers. MicroRNA (miRNA) expression profiles differ widely across cell types, including cancer, and can therefore be used as cell-specific identifiers. Additionally, new multiplexing techniques in which one miRNA needs to be lowly expressed and another highly expressed conveys added specificity to these miRNA circuits. These inventors describe two technologies that improve upon current miRNA circuit designs by increasing system robustness using a self-replicating RNA replicon and designing an all-in-one vector for circuit control.\n\nAdvantages: Increased circuit robustness through use of self-replicating output. All-in-one vector increases efficiency of introducing circuit into cells"

It also includes compatible injection-molded single-use platforms. Applications in organs-on-a-chip (OOC) technology and drug development research are observed.\n\nTechnology: The EM pump uses electrical energy supplied by a battery. Using either a linear or teeter-totter design, the EM actuators are sufficient for meso- or micro-scale OOC platforms, and can be scaled accordingly for other suitable uses. The EM actuators consist of a stator body with permanent magnets, two protruding legs with a coiled connecting segment, a rotor or mover, and various flexures. The innovative latching design contributes to the actuator’s low energy consumption. A short pulse of energy switches the actuator state, while springs store some of the kinetic energy and recover it in the reverse stroke.\n\nProblem Addressed: The demand for clinically relevant, drug development research using improved microphysiological systems (MPSs) has risen. Currently, poor hardware design and fabrication of these MPSs significantly reduce long-term reliability, compatibility with existing devices, and control over fluid directionality. Pneumatic diaphragm micro-pumps are systemic components that facilitate fluid-media circulation. They require considerable effort to set up and they depend on external pressure and vacuum sources. This becomes a challenge when considering the sterility requirements during and after assembly. There exists a crucial need for a portable pump and easily integratable, single-use, sterile platforms in MPSs to further understand drug pharmacokinetics and subsequent organ response.\n\nAdvantages: Low energy consumption. Faster, easier set up. Integration with single-use platforms"
MIT,Realization of Large Thermopower Using Semimetals and Narrow-Gap Semiconductors in a MagneticField,Case number: #19706,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/realization-large-thermopower-using-semimetals-and,"Thermoelectric materials are vital for the development of thermoelectric generators and coolers used in manufacturing processes. These materials can save energy and money with heating processes.\n\nTechnology: The limitations of metals and insulators can be overcome through the use of doped nodal semimetals in a strong magnetic field. The magnetic field ensures that the transverse drift of both electrons and holes contribute additively to the thermopower. Within a sufficiently high magnetic field, a large enhancement of the electronic density of states and a reduction in the Fermi energy occurs. Since the thermoelectrode materials have small band gaps and electron-hole symmetry in their band structure, concentrations of thermally excited electrons and holes both grow - even while their difference remains fixed. These magnetic field effects allow the thermopower to grow without saturation.\n\nProblem Addressed: Thermoelectric materials are a useful tool in generating power from waste heat or transforming electric current into cooling power. Finding materials with large thermopower is vital for the development of thermoelectric generators and thermoelectric coolers. The effectiveness of a thermoelectric material for power applications is quantified by its thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT. In an insulator, thermopower is large, but since conductivity is low, ZT is characteristically low. Metals have robust conductivity yet lack strong thermopower so they yield relatively low ZT.\n\nAdvantages: Substantial thermopower generated from device is amplified by magnetic field allowing ZT to grow without saturation. Generates an electric field/cooling effect along two directions"

Such catalysts can include nanoparticles of molybdenum (Mo), chromium (Cr), or their respective oxides as well as a mix of any component of these. These catalyst materials promote improved reaction kinetics in an electrochemical cell composed of an anode that contains lithium and a polysulfide solution; a cathode that contains metal salts dissolved in water; and a semi-permeable separator between the anode and the cathode.\n\nProblem Addressed: In a lithium-air battery, lithium (Li) and oxygen (O2) combine during discharge to form Li2O2. As the battery charges, Li2O2 must decompose to the original Li and O2 compounds. This decomposition process occurs slowly and at a high voltage. The present invention improves reaction kinetics and coulombic efficiency of a rechargeable lithium-air battery. Furthermore, this novel configuration employs use of catalyst materials as efficient as precious metals but available at a lower cost.\n\nAdvantages: Low-cost system. Long-duration energy storage. Employs use of solid electrolyte configuration. Quick charge/improved charge rates"
MIT,Long Distance Video Camera-Based Vibration  Measurement ofStructures,Case number: #18232,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/long-distance-video-camera-based-vibration,"This technology measures the vibrations of structures from a long distance in an uncontrolled outdoor setting using a video camera. It can be used to measure the displacement of a structure for damage detection or be otherwise used in a change detection algorithm for the health monitoring of structures.\n\nTechnology: In this method, a video camera records a long video of a structure of interest under typical operational or ambient vibrations. A region of interest in the video is defined around the structure. At least two stationary objects outside the region of interest must also be in the video frame as references for motion compensation. In-plane displacements of the object are extracted from the video for both the structure of interest and other regions of the video. The displacement signals from the structure of interest are compensated for camera motion, and then can be initially analyzed in the time domain or frequency domain by averaging the signals. Then any detailed analysis for the condition assessment of the structure can be carried out using the measured displacement signals of the structure of interest. These methods for monitoring changes in the displacement signal can include statistical pattern recognition techniques, one-class machine learning methods, analysis of non-linear features or similar damage detection algorithms.\n\nProblem Addressed: Large structures such as bridges, buildings and antenna towers are subject to rain and high winds among other environmental effects that can cause deterioration such as corrosion and metal fatigue. Monitoring the condition of these structures is critical to public safety; however, traditional means of infrastructure inspection, such as those that use wired accelerometers, are typically expensive and labor-intensive to use. The Inventors have developed an alternative method that uses a fast and simple camera set-up to track the resonant frequency and other properties of a structure’s displacement signal over time, to monitor signs of potential damage.\n\nAdvantages: Cameras are quick to set up and can measure a large structure compared to traditional wired accelerometers that are labor intensive to use. Without the need for physical access to instrument a structure, cameras can more easily collect data from structures that might otherwise be difficult or time consuming to instrument. Continuous monitoring of structures with cameras is tractable in the near future"
MIT,An Adaptive System for Signal Search with CompressedData,Case number: #18906,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/adaptive-system-signal-search-compressed-data,"The inventors have developed an adaptive system for performing signal search on compressed data. Signal search is critical to many applications in signal processing, including radar, radio transmissions and network localization.\n\nTechnology: The Inventors set forth a statistical framework, where a decision vector is obtained from a received sample vector through a non-linear transformation and a linear compression. The search is then performed by selecting an element of the vector through a decision rule. The system design is divided parts corresponding to the three sections of the scheme: (i) non-linear transformation; (ii) linear compression; and (iii) decision rule. The non-linear transformation improves the performance under different operating conditions. The linear compression is used to reduce the search computational complexity.\n\nProblem Addressed: Many applications in signal processing require the search for a signal in a received waveform. A system for signal search usually processes the received samples through a non-linear receiver and makes a decision based on a decision rule. This is designed to achieve a performance goal in terms of detection rate or false-alarm rate. This search can be made through soft-decision or hard-decision approaches that typically yield suboptimal solutions for reducing complexity. The Inventors propose a new scheme for an adaptive system that performs signal search on compressed data which yields more optimal solutions. Their system is designed to solve an optimization problem whose objective function (i) is adaptive according to the variability of the operating environment and (ii) has low-complexity computation.\n\nAdvantages: Generalized system with respect to the measured variables (e.g., frequency, time and space). System is adaptable to the operating environment (e.g., through use of channel state information). Decision processes are low complexity compared to traditional methods"
MIT,Self-Bearing Hysteresis Motor for RotaryPumps,Case number: #17948,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/self-bearing-hysteresis-motor-rotary-pumps,"This technology can be used in making:\n\nMiniature pumps for biomedical applications\nPrecision pumps for chemical and semiconductor industries\nTurbo-molecular pumps for vacuum industries\nHigh-speed motors for machining \nTurbochargers\nActuator motors in electric vehicles\nTurbines\n\nTechnology: This technology uses a self-bearing hysteresis motor as the electromechanical device that transforms the input electric power to output mechanical power in a rotational form in order to pump the fluid. The pump impeller is magnetically levitated and rotates without any mechanical connections such as bearings and shafts. Absence of permanent magnets or saliency features in the pump results in reduced manufacturing cost as well as lower vibration level during the operation.\n\nProblem Addressed: Several chemical and biological processes require pumps to transport delicate fluids such as biological and chemical reagents. In these sensitive processes, usage of traditional pumps can lead to potential contamination of the transport fluid with the pump lubricants. Moreover, the properties of the transport fluid can be changed due to the stress and heat developed in a conventional pump.\n\nAdvantages: Low cost. Low vibration. Zero contamination of the process fluid with the pump lubrication. Reduced mechanical stress and heat on the process fluid. Disposable impeller modules. High rotational speed can be achieved. Low operating power for the levitation mechanism"
MIT,Novel Peptidic Agents for Targeting Chemoresistant Anti-ApoptoticBfl-1,Case number: #18607,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/novel-peptidic-agents-targeting-chemoresistant-anti-1,"Peptide inhibitors of Bfl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein, allow for selective targeting of Bfl-1 dependent cancer cells in therapeutic treatment. Selective peptides may also be used as Bfl-1-detection reagents. This allows for cellular profiling for anti-apoptotic protein dependency, thus potentially acting as a diagnostic tool for stratifying patients.\n\nTechnology: Selective peptide inhibitors of Bfl-1 were identified by screening for sequence variants of the BH3 motif of PUMA, a highly potent binder of Bcl-2 family members. Peptides were designed using computational analysis followed by experimental screening that identified peptides with high affinity for Bfl-1 yet weakened interactions with other anti-apoptotic proteins. The lead peptide inhibitors are >100-fold selective for binding to Bfl-1 binding over other anti-apoptotic proteins of Bcl-2 family. Selectivity towards Bfl-1 was further augmented by modifying the peptide inhibitors with electrophiles to allow for covalent interaction in the binding pocket of Bfl-1. The selectivity of the peptide Bfl-1 inhibitors in a cellular context was confirmed by the relative mitochondrial depolarization or cytochrome-c release after peptide treatment of Bfl-1 dependent cells vs. other anti-apoptotic protein dependent cells.\n\nProblem Addressed: Many cancer cells overexpress anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins that confer resistance to chemotherapy treatment. Selective inhibitors of Bcl-2 are available in clinic to treat Bcl-2 dependent cancers. However, such tools are missing for Bfl-1. Selective inhibitors allow for selective targeting of Bfl-1 dependent cancer cells while limiting systemic toxicity.\n\nAdvantages: The peptide inhibitors are potent and selective towards Bfl-1 with >100-fold selectivity over other anti-apoptotic proteins. The peptide inhibitors can also be used as diagnostic tools to profile cells for Bfl-1 dependency"
MIT,Oil Displacement System to Mitigate Open-Circuit Corrosion in Metal-Air and Metal-SeawaterBatteries,Case number: #18627,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/oil-displacement-system-mitigate-open-circuit,"Metal-air batteries can be used in a variety of applications ranging from range extenders for electric vehicles to emergency power systems. Metal-seawater batteries are primarily used for underwater applications ranging from torpedoes to underwater unmanned vehicles.\n\nTechnology: The main elements of the system include a metal-air cell, a tank of mineral oil and electrolyte, and a separate tank of water. Pumps and pipes move liquids between these three parts. The device displaces corrosive electrolyte from the anode surface by pumping oil into the cell. In comparison to other mechanical corrosion mitigation methods, this oil displacement method increases volumetric energy density by 15%. Additionally, a liquid that has a different density than the electrolyte, is immiscible in the electrolyte, non-conducting, inviscid, and nonreactive with the other system components could replace the oil in this system.\n\nProblem Addressed: Metal-air/seawater batteries have high gravimetric energy densities; however, open-circuit (OC) anode corrosion causes severe capacity fade when the battery is shut off.  Previous technologies focus on chemical mitigation methods (i.e. changing electrode or electrolyte composition), which provide insufficient corrosion mitigation and power density. Other mechanical corrosion mitigation methods require flushing the cell, which increases the volume of tanks required for the system. The proposed technology implements a system that displaces the electrolyte with oil when the battery is off to prevent OC corrosion.\n\nAdvantages: Decreases anode corrosion in metal-air batteries. Enables high power density and frequent, prolonged battery shut-offs"
MIT,Coupled Split Path Power ConversionArchitecture,Case number: #18654,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/coupled-split-path-power-conversion-architecture,"Power converters are used for direct current (DC) distribution systems, computers, telecommunications, data centers, transportation, lighting, displays, and medical applications that require high power density and quick response.\n\nTechnology: The invented power converter includes a coupled split path (CSP) power conversion circuit and a power distributor circuit. The CSP power conversion circuit includes inverter cells, a transformer and rectifier cells, and is connected to the power distributor circuit to split power provided from one or more sources into multiple voltage domains. By splitting the power into the multiple voltage domains with use of the invented structure, the impact of parasitic losses in circuit operation is reduced and the operation range of each voltage domain is compressed.\n\nProblem Addressed: Traditional magnetic converters such as forward converters or flyback converters are generally simple, low-cost and easy to control. However, there is a continued trend to operate power converters at ever increasing switching frequencies. As switching frequencies increase, the converter timing becomes difficult to satisfy, and parasitic losses become significant. Furthermore, it becomes more challenging for designs of the power converter systems due to requirements for achieving high performance in efficiency, power density, ac line synchronization, total harmonic distortion (THD) or power factor, over a wide operating range of universal line input voltages.\n\nAdvantages: Efficiency over an operating voltage range which is wider than that of prior. Reduced inductor size. Reduced parasitics at high frequency"
MIT,FAST: Free Adaptive Super-Resolution via Transfer for CompressedVideos,Case number: #18667,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/fast-free-adaptive-super-resolution-transfer,"With its ability to be combined with existing algorithms, this invention has wide application for imaging or video industries that support real-time upsampling of low-resolution videos streamed from the cloud and onto high-resolution displays.\n\nTechnology: Free Adaptive Super-resolution via Transfer (FAST) is a patented technique that accelerates image-based transfer on compressed videos to enhance video resolution. FAST leverages the inter-frame similarity between adjacent frames in a video sequence with a typical frame rate of 30 fps (frames per second). For further acceleration, FAST uses non-overlapping block division embedded in the compressed video to avoid redundant computations in the transfer process. These key features of FAST promote efficient and accelerated super-resolution by exploiting information already embedded in compressed videos.\n\nProblem Addressed: Existing super-resolution (SR) algorithms used to upsample low-resolution videos focus more on the visual quality of upsampled video frames rather than the real-time processing capability. The computation cost required to process upsampled video frames causes a bottleneck to running these algorithms in real-time. The inventors demonstrate an effective technique that promotes faster video super-resolution with negligible computation cost.\n\nAdvantages: Novel technique that amortizes away the running time of single image based SR methods.

MIT,Wide-Operating-Range Resonant-Transition Soft-SwitchedConverter,Case number: #18677,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/wide-operating-range-resonant-transition-soft,"This technology uses a soft switching technique in power converters to decrease energy loss during voltage conversion. The circuit topologies and control strategies of this invention are best suited for DC-DC power converters with large voltage/power ranges or AC-DC/DC-ACconverters which inherently must accommodate wide voltage/power ranges. The technology has particular advantages in AC-DC/DC-AC conversion, where the technology enables the use of a reduced dc link voltage (maintaining the advantages above), which benefits systems that interact with low-voltage sources or loads.\n\nTechnology: This technology employs soft switching circuits, switching patterns, and control methods to mitigate power loss in converters.  In particular, the technology provides a technique to simultaneously achieve soft switching over a wide voltage and power range and accomplish this with low rms current and hence low conduction loss.\n\nProblem Addressed: Power systems with grid-connected electronic loads can lose twenty to seventy percent of energy during the voltage conversion process. Systems with wide voltage operating ranges are especially prone to high loss. A low power factor in power lines can also attribute to the energy loss in grid-connected systems. To address this challenge, converters must be capable of operating over a large operating range with high efficiency and high-power density.\n\nAdvantages: Zero voltage switching during power conversion over wide operating ranges. Mitigates power loss from parasitics (capacitance and inductance components) during power conversion. Achieves both high efficiency and high-power density in large operating range converters.

MIT,Method and Apparatus for Reducing Power Dissipation on Bit-Serial CommunicationInterfaces,Case number: #18693,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/method-and-apparatus-reducing-power-dissipation-bit,"The Inventors introduce value-deviation-bounded serial (VDBS) encoding that significantly reduces signal transitions between bits of a single serialized word, trading power efficiency for data accuracy. This tradeoff is worthwhile when the data are from signal sources such as sensors and destined for consumption by signal processing algorithms that are error tolerant. This technology can be used to develop wearable, embedded and mobile processing platforms.\n\nTechnology: The Inventors present Rake, an efficient algorithm for VDBS encoding. Rake reduces signal transitions and thereby reduces dynamic power dissipation on serial communication interfaces, by permitting a selectable amount of deviation from correctness in transmitted data with small overheads in practical applications.\n\nProblem Addressed: Wearable computing platforms such as health-tracking and head-mounted systems present new challenges to energy-efficient design. The processors in these platforms are connected to many sensor integrated circuits (ICs) and the data transfer between ICs is usually the main focus of the power-reduction efforts. Because the power-efficiency for inter-IC communication is limited by printed circuit board properties, it has not scaled with advantages in semiconductor technology. Efforts to-date at reducing the inter-IC communication cost are targeted toward parallel busses, and not bit-serial communication links that are used in many embedded computing platforms. The Inventors have come up with a VDBS encoding technique that reduce signal transitions and thereby reduce dynamic power dissipation on bit-serial communication interfaces.\n\nAdvantages: Rake’s execution time is linear in the word size of the value it encodes for a highly effective and efficient algorithm. When evaluated by encoding data in a pedometer system and in a text-recognition system, Rake reduced transitions by 54% on average, in exchange for step count errors smaller than 5% in the pedometer system. For the text recognizer, Rake reduced transitions by 55% on average, while maintaining accuracy above 90%"
MIT,Patterning of Arbitrary 3D Surfaces via Direct-Write HybridLithography,Case number: #17535J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/patterning-arbitrary-3d-surfaces-direct-write-hybrid,"This technology has applications in patterning electronic circuits onto components with arbitrary 3D geometry, adding topographical features to curved optical elements, and depositing catalysts for growing nanomaterials on curved surfaces.\n\nTechnology: The technology described in this invention patterns curved surfaces without using fixed masks by accurately projecting light onto the photoresist-coated surface. In a departure from existing laser-based approaches, this system has a light projection system made up of an array of MEMS mirrors, each of which can be tilted to control whether individual pixels get illuminated. The projection module is attached to a six degree-of-freedom robotic arm that positions it in relation to the object being patterned, which is itself mounted on a rotary axis.\n\nProblem Addressed: A number of approaches to patterning photosensitive materials on arbitrarily shaped surfaces have been attempted. For example, companies such as Panasonic and Aiscent Technologies have developed laser-based systems to pattern curved surfaces. These methods are limited by restrictions in material choice, patternable area, and throughput. Additionally, some of them are further restricted to patterning spherical surfaces. Alternative technologies for patterning 3D surfaces include direct printing using inkjet technology and adapting conventional stereolithographic techniques to print non-normally onto substrate surfaces. These approaches are unable to handle undercuts or concave areas, limiting their utility to surfaces viewable from a single axis. This invention proposes a novel method of patterning 3D surfaces that overcomes these limitations, enabling high-resolution patterning of arbitrarily shaped 3D surfaces over large areas.\n\nAdvantages: Reduces substrate heating to enable patterning on biological materials. 7-axis relative motion system allows the patterning of undercuts and concave surfaces. Feedback control using inline machine vision improves patterning accuracy over large areas"
MIT,An Oxaliplatin Crosslinker for the Formation of Drug DeliveryNanoparticles,Case number: #17532,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/oxaliplatin-crosslinker-formation-drug-delivery,"This technology is a nanoparticle-based delivery method for the chemotherapeutic oxaliplatin that has applications as a cancer therapeutic.\n\nTechnology: This technology uses brush arm star polymers (BASPs) nanoparticles to package oxaliplatin, a platinum-based chemotherapeutic. The nanoparticles are composed of an oxaliplatin core surrounded by a corona of highly branched hydrophilic BASPs. The nanoparticles efficiently self-target to tumors, where they then release the chemotherapeutic payload. This delivery method protects the rest of the body from harmful side effects and maximizes drug concentration within the tumor. The chemotherapeutics irinotecan and 5FU, which are frequently used in combination with oxaliplatin, can optionally be packaged along with oxaliplatin in the BASP nanoparticle. The triple combination therapy BASPs demonstrate striking effectiveness in a mouse transplant model of ovarian cancer and a significant portion of the mice display complete tumor eradication. The chemotherapeutic nanoparticles are well tolerated and display minimal toxicity in mice.\n\nProblem Addressed: Platinum-based chemotherapies are one of the most effective and widely used chemotherapies for solid tumor malignancies including testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer. However, platinum-based chemotherapeutics also have very high toxicity, and side effects can often limit the dose given to patients. This invention is a novel nanoparticle-based method to deliver platinum-based chemotherapies to reduce toxic side effects while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.\n\nAdvantages: Controlled release nanoparticles for oxaliplatin delivery. Reduced toxicity compared to traditional oxaliplatin therapy. Oxaliplatin can be packaged singly or in combination with irinotecan and 5FU. Highly effective in. in vivo. transplant models"
MIT,Short Wave InfraredOtoscope,Case number: #17529J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/short-wave-infrared-otoscope,"This invention is an optical device which uses shortwave infrared light to detect middle ear pathologies.\n\nTechnology: The inventors have developed a Short Wavelength Infrared (SWIR) otoscope which could improve doctors' ability to diagnose middle ear infections. This device is composed of a light source, a SWIR camera, and a medical viewing instrument, such as an otoscope or an endoscope. The advantage of using SWIR light is the easier detection of middle ear fluid based on its strong light absorption.  Additionally, the shortwave infrared light can penetrate deeper within the tissue, enabling better visualization of the middle ear through the tympanic membrane. Using a SWIR otoscope, the middle ear with the presence of otitis media with effusion will become completely dark allowing for easy differentiation between the presence or absence of the middle ear fluid. In addition, under conditions of no otitis media, the SWIR otoscope is able to visualize in great detail the ossicular chain of the middle ear. This detail, which is obstructed by the tympanic membrane in visible and near-infrared imaging techniques, can allow an examiner to rule out ossicular chain disruptions.\n\nProblem Addressed: Studies have shown that about 8 million children in the U.S each year are diagnosed with otitis media, the medical term encompassing middle ear infections. A clear diagnostic sign of a middle ear infection is the buildup of fluid behind the ear drum. Reliably identifying the presence of middle ear fluid can be challenging in a pediatric patient. Commonly used methods such as pneumotoscopy are highly operator-dependent and can suffer both in sensitivity and specificity even in the hands of an experienced practitioner. The development of an otoscope sensitive to shortwave infrared light would enable better contrast of fluid in an image of the ear, potentially resulting in more reliable fluid identification during an ear examination.\n\nAdvantages: Reliably identifies the presence of middle ear fluid in a patient. Greater transparency of the ear drum enables clear visualization of underlying middle ear anatomy. Add-on device that can be used with currently used otoscopes and endoscopes"
MIT,2-Terminal Perovskite/Crystalline Silicon Multijunction Solar Cell Enabled by Silicon-Based Band-to-Band TunnelJunction,Case number: #17501J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/2-terminal-perovskitecrystalline-silicon,"Perovskite/crystalline silicon multijunction solar cells can be used as an alternative to conventional solar cells. Perovskite/crystalline silicon multijunction solar cells improve cell efficiency by incorporating multiple bandgaps.\n\nTechnology: One of the most promising ways to surpass the efficiency limit of current solar cells is by reducing the thermalization loss of high energy photons, which can be done by building solar cells in multijunction configuration using materials with different bandgaps. In this technology, the materials are silicon and an organic-inorganic halide perovskite. Perovskite was chosen because it is capable of being an efficient solar cell material despite being deposited at low-temperature and requires low-capex. The integration of perovskite top solar cell and crystalline silicon bottom solar cell is enabled by the introduction of silicon-based tunnel junction connecting the two solar cells. Depending on the perovskite chosen, the efficiency limit can be increased up to 39%.\n\nProblem Addressed: Currently, solar cells have been unable to surpass the Shockley-Queisser Limit, which is determined by the material band gap. Because single junction solar cells only have one bandgap, photons with energy below or above this bandgap energy are not completely converted to electrical energy. However, this design overcomes this limit by creating a multijunction cell using organic-inorganic halide perovskite.\n\nAdvantages: Increases solar cell efficiency. Reduces cost per unit power of photovoltaics"
MIT,Genome Editing and Perturbations with Miniature CRISPRNucleases,Case number: #22230,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/genome-editing-and-perturbations-miniature-crispr,"This technology provides systems, methods, and compositions of miniature CRISPR-associated (Cas) nucleases to edit genes and control their activation and inhibition. This technology has applicability in the development of diagnostic tools, in addition to gene therapies.\n\nTechnology: The technology is a miniature CRISPR nuclease that is target specific, compact in structure, and made up of a small number of amino acids (<800-1000). The nuclease targets DNA and is directed by a guide RNA (gRNA) to a target nucleic acid sequence, which is commonly a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). The gRNA can be a single-guide RNA, which is a blend of two non-coding RNAs: a synthetic CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and a trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA). This system allows for the insertion or deletion of base pairs in DNA. The target specific nuclease cleaves the DNA at a target site, leaving overhangs on both ends of the DNA. Then, in nucleotide insertion, a nucleotide is added complementary to the overhanging nucleotide on both ends. In deletion, the overhanging nucleotides on both ends are removed. Finally, the DNA ends are ligated together to complete the insertion or deletion of base pairs.\n\nProblem Addressed: Application of CRISPR-Cas gene-editing tools without the need for repair-pathway dependent editing in mammalian cells is challenging because it requires the expression and delivery of as many as 4-7 proteins to the nucleus for proper assembly and DNA targeting. Furthermore, the ability to use Cas9 and Cas12 nucleases in CRISPR-Cas gene editing systems in vivo or ex vivo is hindered by their size, which can be as many as 1000 amino acids long. Therefore, technologies that edit or program the activation or inhibition of genes based on these nucleases cannot typically be delivered to mice by known viral vectors including the therapeutically validated adeno-associated vectors (AAV) because of their restricted size capacity (<5 kb). Smaller CRISPR-associated nucleases described here would allow for simpler delivery and extended CRISPR applications by enabling delivery of the nuclease and guide RNA in a single vector.\n\nAdvantages: Small size allows for therapeutic applications not previously possible, including single vector homology directed repair (HDR), epigenetic editing, gene activation and repression, base editing, and prime editing. Wide variety of potential applications provides flexibility for a licensing company"
MIT,"Gastroretentive Electronics for Long-Term, Continuous, and Real-Time Monitoring of AlcoholIntake",Case number: #22231J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/gastroretentive-electronics-long-term-continuous-and,"A wireless, long-term monitoring system to quantitatively sense ingested alcohol in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract before it has been metabolized by the body. This oral pill can be used for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.\n\nTechnology: The novel invention provides long-term, real-time, and continuous monitoring of ingested alcohol levels in subjects via a sensor placed directly in the GI tract. Each device contains a semiconductor gas sensor designed to detect volatile organic compounds with particular sensitivity to ethanol, allowing it to measure actual amounts of alcohol ingested. The device includes a filter membrane that is only permeable to alcohol vapor and protects the electronics from the surrounding gastric fluids. The sensor wirelessly communicates its measurements through a Bluetooth connection to an external receiver. The technology can be delivered orally in a capsule form, or alternatively through a nasogastric tube to the stomach, and then remains in the GI tract after undergoing an expanding shape change (either unfolding, swelling, or both). Proof of concept devices have been tested in vivo for ethanol detection using a porcine animal model system.  Thus, it can provide long-term, accurate alcohol intake measurements by monitoring the alcohol itself in the GI tract, not just the secondary information from metabolized alcohol.\n\nProblem Addressed: There is currently a lack of accurate and readily available devices to quantitatively monitor alcohol intake and frequency among the millions of Americans with alcohol use disorder. While a few can provide point-of-care alcohol intake monitoring (e.g., transdermal and breath alcohol sensors), these options only measure secondary information from metabolized alcohol, and are thus limited in their ability to accurately provide real-time quantitative measurements to support effective and continuous therapeutic intervention.\n\nAdvantages: Provides quantitative, real-time measurements of actual ingested alcohol levels as opposed to secondary metabolite levels calculated by competitor transdermal and breath alcohol devices. Establishes long-term residence in the GI tract to continuously monitor alcohol intake over extended periods of time (at least 24 hours)"
MIT,Real-Time Photorealistic 3D Holographic Display using Deep NeuralRendering,Case number: #22321,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/real-time-photorealistic-3d-holographic-display-using,"The tensor holography technology has a wide range of applications, especially in the consumer electronics industry. Within this industry, the applications for this technology are most readily applied to virtual and augmented reality. This technology could have further applications within the fields of 3D printing, microscopy, and healthcare.\n\nTechnology: The invention, “tensor holography”, enables the creation of real-time, photorealistic 3d holography using deep learning. The inventors introduced the first large-scale 3D hologram dataset with 4000 RGB-D images and paired 3D CGHs. The RGB-D scene consists of various shapes, colors, shading, texture, and a new physical simulation algorithm is introduced to handle occlusion. Using this photorealistic training dataset, the inventors developed the first deep learning based rendering system that uses a convolution neural network to transform RGB-D input to a 3D hologram. The CNN performs this task in tens of milliseconds on a consumer-grade graphics processing unit (GPU). The CNN is very memory-efficient (<1mb) and can run interactively (<1s) on mobile devices (i.e. an iPhone 11 Pro).\n\nProblem Addressed: Virtual reality headsets have gained tremendous popularity. However, one common problem tends to occur— the headsets can make users feel sick. Nausea can be experienced because users’ eyes are being tricked into seeing a 3D scene, when, in fact, they are staring at a 2D fixed-distance display. One possible solution for a better 3D viewing experience would be to have these headsets display 3D computer generated holograms (CGHs). However, creating these 3D CGHs has been no easy feat. CGH algorithms based on physical simulation is very time-consuming, and can take minutes to complete on current high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). This prevents real-time application of CGHs for aforementioned applications, particularly for virtual and augmented reality. Existing CGH algorithms also don’t handle occlusion well and are hard to achieve photorealistic results.\n\nAdvantages: Photorealistic 3D holograms that can be created in milliseconds. The first convolutional neural network created for 3D holography. The first large-scale 3D hologram dataset that consists of custom-made 4,000 pairs of RGB-D images and matched CGHs. Prevent nausea in users who utilize devices with 3D holographic display"
MIT,Engineered Carbon Nanotube Stamp for High Performance Micro-ContactPrinting,Case number: #17486,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/engineered-carbon-nanotube-stamp-high-performance,"Direct printing methods provide cost-effective routes for manufacturing of functional devices in large-area and unconventional formats. In particular, industrial printing technologies including screen, inkjet, gravure, and flexography, are essential to current and future manufacturing of microelectronics on flexible substrates, including displays, circuits, photovoltaic (PV) arrays, and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. These printing techniques can rapidly reproduce 2D patterns of functional inks (e.g., metal nanoparticles, organic optoelectric materials) onto flat, curved, flexible and stretchable substrates.\n\nTechnology: The inventors have developed a new class of stamp material composed of vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) conformally coated with functional polymers. A thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process is used to grow patterned CNT arrays on silicon substrates, forming vertically aligned “forests” or “arrays” where the individual CNTs are perpendicular to the substrate. The top layer of the CNTs is removed by plasma treatment, which reduces the surface modulus and enables conformal contact against the target substrates. The individual CNTs within the arrays are coated with functional polymer films, such as poly-perfluorodecylacrylate, p(PFDA), by initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) process. This conformal p(PFDA) coating is an average thickness of 30 nm and ensures the microstructures do not shrink or collapse after wetting and dewetting. Finally, the polymer coated CNT arrays are plasma-treated again to control the surface wettability. This new stamp microstructures are highly porous (>90% porosity), wettable with colloidal inks but mechanically durable against capillary shrinkage, and yet compliant enough to enable conformal contact during flexographic printing. As a result, the stamps enable direct printing of liquid inks with micrometer lateral resolution which surpasses the resolution limit of undustrial flexography technology by >10-fold.\n\nProblem Addressed: Lateral resolution of conventional printing methods is in general limited to 10-100 µm, which remains as a main challenge toward high performance electronics. For example, inkjet is limited by the size of the droplet ejected from the nozzle aperture; due to the limiting strength and frequency of transducers compared to the force required to eject smaller liquid droplets. The resolutions of screen printing and gravure are strongly restricted by the key geometrical parameters of printing tools, such as the woven mesh openings in screen printing stencil and volume of the engraved cells in gravure cylinder. Although elastomeric stamp features can easily be reduced to nanometer range using replica molding techniques, flexography is also limited because of the contact-mediated liquid instabilities and spreading.\n\nAdvantages: Direct-printing allows for low-cost, rapid and mass production capabilities. Nanoporous stamp can be sized to sub-micrometer scale while retaining mechanical robustness. Direct printing of electronic nanomaterials with few micrometer lateral resolution. Engineered for automated, mass production systems for high throughput production. Far-ranging applications including repeatable liquid printing, electrical micro-contact printing, and tunable wettability/adhesion of stamp surface depending on coating"
MIT,End-to-End Deep Learning Approach to Predict Complex Stress and Strain Fields Directly from MicrostructuralImages,Case number: #22477,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/end-end-deep-learning-approach-predict-complex-stress,"This technology is a method of determining mechanical behaviors of hierarchical composites using a game-theoretic deep learning approach. This technology has broad applications and may be particularly useful in the study and design of complex biological materials, polymers, ceramics, and metals.\n\nTechnology: This technology uses material geometry and microstructure to generate strain and stress fields via a deep learning model. The method includes using geometric images as inputs into a generator to produce fake stress or strain field images of composites under mechanical tests. The fake field images are then analyzed in a discriminator neural network to determine if the fake field images represent real stress and strain images produced by multiscale modeling methods (i.e., finite element analysis). This step is repeated until the discriminator can optimize its ability to identify the fake field images produced by the generator. The deep learning model is trained once the discriminator and generator reach Nash equilibrium.\n\nProblem Addressed: Designing composite materials relies on conjoining different base materials and manipulating complex microstructures. In model-driven design of such materials, calculation of physical properties often relies on multiscale modeling approaches such as finite element analysis (FEM) or molecular dynamics simulations. However, a large gap exists between the design space and physical performance of these materials due to the intractable number of computational measurements.\n\nAdvantages: Prediction of material behavior is not limited by shape, boundary conditions, or geometrical hierarchy.. Provide an efficient method to evaluate physical properties of hierarchical materials directly from analyzing their geometry.. Bottom-up design process that can accelerate optimal composite material design."
MIT,Ultrasensitive and Self-Powered PDVF Nanofiber StrainSensors,Case number: #17485JDE,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/ultrasensitive-and-self-powered-pdvf-nanofiber-strain,"This technology has applications in wearable electronic, sport performance monitoring and human motion capture, structural health monitoring and rehabilitation, as well as artificial limbs.\n\nTechnology: The invention utilizes special properties of Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-derived sensor technology to produce an inexpensive, self-powered and ultrasensitive strain sensor with a high response speed, high stretchability, and strong piezoelectric behavior. Utilizing a new fabrication process and a special synthetic polymer substance, PVDF, the inventors developed a strain sensor with novel characteristics. The simple fabrication method retains the innate flexibility of PVDF, while guaranteeing strong piezoelectric behavior, reliability in manufacture and high yields in fabrication. The resulting strain sensor is ultrasensitive, flexible and self-powered, making it an ideal candidate for wearable electronics applications, with potential for use in large area arrays.\n\nProblem Addressed: With the advent of artificial limb and advanced human motion capturing technology, stretchable, self-powered and ultrasensitive nano-sensors exhibiting strong piezoelectric behavior are requisite. Current sensor technology relies on expensive and externally-powered sensors with complex designs and low stretchability.\n\nAdvantages: High response speed and stretchability with strong piezoelectric behavior. Simple and inexpensive fabrication process ensures reliability and repeatability. Self-powered design ideal for wearable electronics applications"
MIT,Convection-Enhanced Electrochemical Energy StorageDevice,Case number: #22807,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/convection-enhanced-electrochemical-energy-storage-0,"Convection-enhanced electrochemical cells enable faster complete charging and discharging of high-capacity batteries. Such batteries are of great potential interest to manufacturers of electric vehicles and providers of grid-level energy storage solutions.\n\nTechnology: In addition to the elements of a traditional electrochemical cell, convection-enhanced electrochemical cells incorporate a mechanical pump that drives electrolyte through the electrodes and separators. Pumping electrolyte through the cell augments the rate at which ions move in the desired direction for charging and discharging, allowing the full capacity of the cell to be accessed even when the electrode materials are higher-capacity and the charging and discharging are done at higher-power. In addition to a general scheme to increase performance by pumping electrolyte, the patent application discloses a suite of analytical tools for quantitatively predicting the performance increases that can be expected from incorporating electrolyte pumping into an electrochemical energy system. These tools will enable identification of systems in which incorporation of electrolyte pumping can be expected to be economical.\n\nProblem Addressed: A key barrier to the adoption of lithium-ion batteries in transportation is the immense difficulty of charging an electric vehicle on a timescale compatible with consumer expectations based on many years of simply pumping a few gallons of gasoline to refuel. Furthermore, the relatively slow charging has led to a preoccupation with electric vehicle range and thus a need to produce high-capacity batteries. Limitations in how quickly grid-scale energy storage batteries can safely charge similarly require more batteries to absorb the energy generated by solar when the sun is shining and wind when wind speeds are high.\n\nAdvantages: Improved charge/discharge capacity. Improved charge/discharge speed. Improved safety"
MIT,Multilayer MicrohydraulicTechnology,Case number: #22940L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/multilayer-microhydraulic-technology,"This technology has applications in the field of microhydraulic motors (actuators) specifically, precision robotics for surgeries, exoskeletal joints, microscale operating systems, and programmable and self-assembling materials.\n\nTechnology: A microhydraulic actuator works via electrowetting, a technique that applies electrical voltage to water droplets on a solid surface, thereby distorting the surface tension of the liquid. This distortion is leveraged by the actuator when it forces the liquid droplets inside the actuator to move the entire unit. Originally, this took place via a thin polyimide film sitting on top of a thick base. This technology provides enhancements by incorporating the electrode and droplet arrays into one thin film. Multiples of this singular, thin layer can be stacked while remaining individually powered to form a liquid interconnected network. In doing so, this technology allows for optimized characteristics of microhydraulic systems (increased power, torque, etc.).\n\nProblem Addressed: The ubiquitous inductive electric motor has been impossible to miniaturize below approximately a gram in mass, due to inherent inefficiencies from thermal losses.  Achieving motion in a small form factor has remained a technological challenge, often addressed with piezoelectric or thermal actuators working at sub-optimal efficiencies.  Microhydraulic actuator technology provides an efficient and scalable motor technology solution, for motors down to milligrams in mass, and provides much higher torque density for motors at any size scale.\n\nAdvantages: Optimized characteristics of traditional microhydraulic systems. Increased reaction time of system due to its multilayer design. Decreased stiction and abrasion common in other mechanical systems"
MIT,Array-Based Compressed SensingReceiver,Case number: #17482L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/array-based-compressed-sensing-receiver,"This technology has applications in small size, efficient and wide-band radio frequency surveillance system, communication systems, as well as radio frequency sensing and cognitive radios.\n\nTechnology: The technology is an Array-based Compressed sensing Receiver Architecture (ACRA) that eliminates the need for a cueing receiver by incorporating a wideband scanning mode in a sensitive digital receiver array. ACRA extends the functionality of a narrowband, tuned digital receiver array to also detect signals over very wide bandwidths by employing compressed sensing (CS) techniques. ACRA offers persistent surveillance of the entire tuning bandwidth increasing the likelihood of detecting short bursts of RF energy and reducing the delay in detecting persistent waveforms with little to no increase in power requirements, cost or system complexity.\n\nProblem Addressed: There is increasing demand for systems capable of identifying, locating and responding to electromagnetic emissions found anywhere in extremely wide bandwidths, including to determine whether a given frequency band is occupied or available to a cognitive radio. Currently, high sensitivity, narrowband receiver arrays capable of decoding signals and determining direction-of-arrival (DoA) must be tuned to a frequency of interest provided by prior knowledge of the spectrum or a less sensitive, wideband cueing receiver.  These cueing receivers add size, weight, and power to the overall system.  Without cueing, the spectral coverage is limited to the instantaneous bandwidth of the receiver, which is much less than the tuning bandwidth.\n\nAdvantages: Enables persistent surveillance of the entire bandwidth. Extends the functionality of a narrowband, tuned digital receiver array to include signal detection. Low power, weight and cost alternative to traditional IFM receiver technology"
MIT,"Structures, Compositions and Fabrications of Microbump Based Interconnect Technology for High DensityPackaging",Case number: #17465L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/structures-compositions-and-fabrications-microbump,"This technology relates generally to multi-layer semiconductor devices. These devices are used in most of today’s electronics like phones, tablets, and computers. It is also useful in military applications for lightweight sensors and flight electronics.\n\nTechnology: This technology presents an approach to provide the thinnest possible active area cross section for a multi-tier, flip-chip capable, hybrid, 3D Integrated Circuit containing multiple SOI and non-SOI technologies. It uses microbump technology capable of creating single bumps for finer pitch structures or multiple bump arrays for larger pitch structures to minimize solder volume and spreading. The microbump technology minimizes the possibility of electrical shorts so the circuit is still functional. The interconnects consist of microbump and under-bump metallurgy where microbumps react with the under-bump at the interface to create a lower temperature melt interface. This interface melts at a lower temperature than the original bump materials, which makes it possible to create interconnects that can be reworked as double assembly and maintain reliable contact. These devices and circuit elements can be operated at low temperature to provide for reduced operating voltages, higher speed operation, and low power dissipation.\n\nProblem Addressed: In the microelectronics industry, there is a trend toward the miniaturization of electronic devices, and consequently, a need for multilayer semiconductor devices. This trend also demands a simple and cost-effective assembly method for these devices, which include a combination of substrate and via structures. The multilayer devices must show that they can provide an increased circuit density compared to conventional semiconductor devices.\n\nAdvantages: Minimized tendency to create electrical shorts. Reduced Z-height, still capable of maintaining finer pitch interconnect, more efficient circuits. Increased mechanical strength and stability at the interconnect. Interconnects can be of various shape, size, and pitch at the same package level"
MIT,Methods and Systems for Raman Spectroscopy Based Detection of Blood Analytes in the Tympanic MembraneVasculature,Case number: #17459,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/methods-and-systems-raman-spectroscopy-based,"This invention presents methods and systems for designing and building miniaturized Raman spectroscopic systems for detection of various bioanalytes, including blood glucose from the middle ear vasculature.\n\nTechnology: Molecular spectroscopy has received considerable contemporary attention for diagnosis of diabetes and cancers in various organs, including breast, skin and bladder. The present invention non-invasively detects and quantifies blood analytes, such as glucose from the tympanic membrane. This invention describes a fiber optic probe-based Raman system where the fiber probe is part of a speculum or a wearable device, e.g., headphones. The fiber optic probe can be inserted into the ear of a patient, illuminating the tympanic membrane with one or more wavelengths of light, collecting Raman scattered light by using a detector that is coupled to the fiber optic probe. The spectral data can then be processed for quantification and used to provide periodic measurements of blood analytes. This method would be appropriate as a real-time clinical adjunct for continuous monitoring of glucose and other analytes, e.g., creatinine, urea and bilirubin, in critical care patients and in neonates, where frequent blood withdrawal is particularly problematic.\n\nProblem Addressed: Raman spectroscopy has been successfully employed to detect molecular species embedded in complex biological samples due to its inherent selectivity, multiplexed capabilities and simple sample preparation. While Raman spectroscopy provides a powerful tool for non-invasive, real-time and multiplexed diagnostics of biological samples, the confounding signal from the tissue fluorescence and spectral shape alteration due to turbidity has prevented the widespread usage of Raman spectroscopy as a diagnostic tool in clinical and the point-of-care settings. The ideal anatomic site should have a thin layer of epidermis, low pigmentation and a substantially high distribution of blood capillaries. Middle ear vasculature, in general, and the tympanic membrane, in particular, offer all the above requirements. By using the tympanic membrane as an anatomic site for the Raman spectroscopy, bioanalyte concentration can be detected and quantified directly from the blood as opposed to being inferred from the interstitial fluid typically used in a non-invasive measurement.\n\nAdvantages: Non-invasive system for detecting and measuring blood analytes, e.g., glucose. Bioanalyte concentration is measured from the actual blood as opposed to the interstitial fluid. Active usage of Raman spectroscopy in clinical and point-of-care setting"
MIT,A Multispectral-Hyperspectral Imaging Method andDevice,Case number: #17412,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/multispectral-hyperspectral-imaging-method-and-device,"This technology has applications in surveillance, remote sensing, chemical and bio-molecular sensing, spectroscopy, as well as the food and petrochemical industry.\n\nTechnology: This technology uses an imaging system comprising set of lenses, wave guiding structures, optical tuning system, and a photodetector pixel array to record multi-spectral images. The properties of the wave guiding structures are modified progressively by the tuning system with simultaneous capture of multiple images by the photodetector array. The spectrophotometric information contained in the captured images is extracted using an algorithm. The spatial decoupling between the focal plane of the optical parts and the photodetector array without opto-mechanical moving parts offers unique advantages including high signal-to-noise ratio that are not available in traditional HSI systems.\n\nAdvantages: Low cost. High spatial resolution. High signal-to-noise ratio. High system reliability and robustness. Sharp and improved image quality. Aberration-free imaging. Easy thermal management. Easily integrable with different cameras"
MIT,Mucins as Regulators of Interspecies MicrobialInteractions,Case number: #17408,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/mucins-regulators-interspecies-microbial-interactions,"This technology uses mucins to maintain diverse microbial populations and has potential applications as a combination therapy with microbial transplants.\n\nTechnology: This technology uses mucins to stabilize inter-species interactions in microbial populations. Mucins are naturally produced in the human body to as a protective coating that covers mucosal linings. Mucous membranes, such as those in the mouth and gastrointestinal tract, have some of the most diverse microbial populations in the body. These inventors demonstrate that adding mucin to communities of microbes promotes diverse populations of microbes by altering inter-species interactions. When added to a bacteria culture, mucins prevent inter-species killing and outgrowth competition by absorbing and neutralizing secreted bacterial toxins and preventing biofilm formation. This technology could potentially be paired with fecal microbial transplants to facilitate the outgrowth of transplanted bacteria and maintain the biodiversity of microbiota in the transplant.\n\nProblem Addressed: The average human body houses trillions of microbes that play an important symbiotic role in maintaining healthy body functions. However, there is a very delicate balance between healthy symbiotic microbes and the more hazardous pathogenic microbes. Perturbations to this equilibrium, such as antibiotic treatment or an infection, can cause permanent detrimental changes to the microbial community that result in susceptibility health problems including infection, inflammatory bowel disease, cavities, and even cancer. Microbial transplants have gained popularity as a treatment option to combat this dysbiosis. This technology stabilizes inter-species microbial interactions and could be used alongside microbial transplants to facilitate maintenance of diverse microbial populations.\n\nAdvantages: Prevents microbial inter-species killing and outgrowth by altering species-species interactions. Potential to improve biodiversity and outgrowth in fecal microbial transplants"
MIT,Dielectric Technology for Nitride SemiconductorDevices,Case number: #17407,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/dielectric-technology-nitride-semiconductor-devices,"Many applications of GaN-based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) require reliable operations at high levels of power and temperature while maintaining a low leakage current. This invention can be used in technologies such as microwaves and power switches as well as in large-scale applications for advanced transportation systems, energy delivery networks, and electricity conversion.\n\nTechnology: The invention describes MOSFETs or Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Heterostructure Field-Effect Transistor (MOSHEMTs) with GaN 9 or other N-containing semiconductor's device containing thermally oxidized polysilicon. The SiO2 dielectric layer is achieved through thermally oxidizing the N-containing semiconductor's Polysilicon layer that rests on top of the semiconductor. The resulting layer of SiO2 is a high-quality oxide with improved properties over deposited oxides that are produced by chemical vapor deposition.  The final dielectric stack is comprised of this thermal SiO2 and a thin layer of native like Ga2O3 at the interface with the AlGaN polarizing layer, which results in a very low Interface States Density (Dit) values. Controlling the temperature of thermal oxidation gives better control of the oxidation rate of the silicon dioxide layer. Since SiO2 limits the rate of oxidation of the nitride semiconductor, one can decrease the rate at which oxidizing species that reach the nitride semiconductor by increasing the thickness of the deposited silicon.\n\nProblem Addressed: Previous attempts at incorporating a dielectric layer to achieve low leakage at high power/temperature operation and improved reliability were unsuccessful in achieving the ideal combination of a large critical electric field and a good interface between the oxide and the semiconductor. The limited critical field of conventional transistors made of silicon leads to bulky commercial devices that operate at low frequencies and require high resistances. This invention creates a semiconductor interface within HEMTs that leads to gate stacks with low interface states density and large critical electric fields necessary for high power operations.

MIT,Electrochemically Responsive Heterogeneous Catalysis Using Redox Polymer/Conducting FibersHybrids,Case number: #17438,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/electrochemically-responsive-heterogeneous-catalysis,"This technology has applications in the control of chemical reactions, such as the Michael addition reactions used to synthesize steroids and other organic compounds, with redox-switchable catalysts.\n\nTechnology: The electrochemically responsive heterogeneous catalyst described in this invention is made up of an electrically conductive matrix and a conformal coating containing an electrochemically active catalytic molecule. For example, a heterogeneous catalyst for the Michael addition of methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) and ethyl-2-oxycyclopentane carboxylate (E2OC) -- a reaction used in steroid synthesis -- can be made by coating a porous carbon fiber matrix with polyvinylferrocene (PVF). Ferrocene (Fc) has no catalytic activity, per se, but its oxidized form, ferrocenium (Fc+), catalyzes the addition reaction.\n\nProblem Addressed: The ability to control the rate of chemical reactions is a critical aspect of reaction engineering. Since many important reactions used in chemical synthesis involve heterogeneous catalysis, a popular strategy to controlling their kinetics is to manipulate the efficacy of the catalysts. Conventionally, this is achieved by changing either the concentration or accessibility of catalytic species by inducing morphological changes to the catalyst carrier using chemical or thermal stimuli. These methods have two limitations. First, the inherent tendency of chemical and thermal inputs to propagate through diffusion prevents fine-grained spatial control of catalytic activity. Secondly, morphological changes to catalyst carriers often entail volumetric and phase (sol-gel) transitions that make existing responsive catalysis strategies challenging to implement in fixed-bed flow reactors. The novel class of responsive heterogeneous catalysts described in this invention addresses these problems by responding to highly localizable electrochemical stimuli and relying on redox transitions instead of morphological changes to control catalytic activity.\n\nAdvantages: Fixed catalyst volume and no leaching allows use in fixed-bed flow reactors. Temporal as well as spatial control of reaction kinetics. Allows continuous modulation of reaction rate"
MIT,Magnetically Aligned Low TortuosityElectrodes,Case number: #17419J,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/magnetically-aligned-low-tortuosity-electrodes,"This technology can be applied to Lithium-ion cells used in electric vehicles to increase ion transport while maintaining energy density.\n\nTechnology: This invention creates low tortuous structures through anisotropic pores, which are oriented in the direction of ion transfer. This process creates anisotropic pores by aligning anisotropic para- or ferro- magnetic fugitive pore formers or chaining of fugitive magnetic particles in the electrode matrix. The fugitive particles are dispersed in a slurry of electrode powder and other additives. A magnetic field is applied to the mixture. The fugitive particles align with the field and then can be slowly removed, or the structure can be consolidated in another fashion (e.g., polymerization, gelation). Alternatively, non-magnetic electrode particles are magnetically induced in a magnetic fluid. The electrode particles align, and the magnetic fluid is evaporated forming a chained structure from the electrode particles. If two different sizes of non-magnetic particles are used at high applied magnetic fields, macro and micro porous channels form in the resulting electrode. Either method creates anisotropic pores aligned with ion transfer to enable a high rate of capability while maintaining energy density and can be used at larger scales to reduce the cost of battery production.\n\nProblem Addressed: By simply doubling the electrode thickness, the cost of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) pack could be reduced by ~$600. However, only making the electrodes thicker allows only a fraction of the stored energy to be delivered at high rates because of decreased ion transport through liquid electrolyte filled pores. Increasing the porosity increases ion transport but simultaneously diminishes the battery’s energy density. However, the proposed technology decreases the tortuosity, a measure of the effectiveness of the pore structure in respect to mass transport, which enables a high rate of capability while maintaining the energy density.\n\nAdvantages: Can reduce battery production cost. Increases rate of capability and maintains energy density"
MIT,Fine-Tuning pKa's of Nucleoside Analogs to Increase Mutagenicity; a Strategy to Develop More Potent Lethal Mutagen with Anti-Viral or AnticancerProperties,Case number: #17657,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/fine-tuning-pkas-nucleoside-analogs-increase,"This technology is method for increasing mutagenicity of nucleoside analogs with potential applications as an anti-viral or cancer therapeutic.\n\nTechnology: This technology can tune the mutagenicity of nucleosides analogs by changing the pKa of the molecule. In its active form, KP1212 is a cytidine nucleotide analog that causes G-to-A mutations. These inventors demonstrated that the KP1212 mutagenic capacity is highly dependent on pH. At physiological pH KP1212 is only marginally mutagenic, resulting in G-to-A mutation only about 10% of the time. Reducing pH. in vitro. significantly increases its mutagenic capacity, which demonstrates that the protonated form of KP1212 is more highly mutagenic. Additionally, this finding suggests that tuning the pKa of KP1212 to be protonated at physiological pH could greatly increase its mutagenic efficiency. Importantly, these results also indicate that tuning the pKa of nucleoside analogs could be a more general mechanism for changing the mutagenic properties of nucleoside analogs.\n\nProblem Addressed: Both viruses and cancers have relatively high rates of mutation, which facilitates rapid evolution of drug tolerance. However, there mutational burden is a delicate balance, and viruses and cancer cells need to sustain a mutation rate and that is favorable for evolution, while also maintaining genetic stability. Too high of a mutational burden can lead to catastrophic collapse of genetic integrity and complete loss of virus or cell viability known as “lethal mutagenesis.” Lethal hypermutation has therefore been proposed as an anti-viral and cancer therapeutic technique and there is at least one FDA approved drug, ribavirin, that uses lethal mutagenesis to treat hepatitis C and viral hemorrhagic fever. The pro-drug KP1212 is another example of a promising mutagenic drug candidate, however, KP1212 displayed only marginal anti-viral effects in clinical trials. This technology is a method for increasing the mutagenicity of nucleoside analogs to potentially maximize their therapeutic potential.\n\nAdvantages: Increased mutagenesis of nucleoside analog KP1212 by tuning pH and pKa. Generalizable strategy for tuning mutagenic capacity by changing pKa"

This significantly increases the difficulty in deducing the initial PUF value from a damaged image. The technology employs a novel two-color phosphor-loaded waveguide technology. When an invasive attempt is made on the system, not only is the image distorted, but color sensitive phosphor is also activated causing a color change in the system. The device can be applied to systems after full fabrication, allowing the security systems of manufactured electronics to be upgraded.\n\nProblem Addressed: Many electronic systems use digital identification for authentication and key derivation to achieve system security. One system security method uses an optical physical unclonable function (PUF), implemented on a printed circuit board. PUFs are constructed from light emitting diodes (LEDs) and an image sensor affixed to the PCB, which is then coated with a thin polymer planar waveguide. The system is designed to create a unique key value from the sensor image. Invasive attempts damage the polymer coating, thus destroying the PUF value. However, there is a concern that advanced invasive methods can deduce the original PUF value from a damaged sensor image.\n\nAdvantages: Includes optical effects for improved security and hacker detection. Increases image distortion for heightened protection of PUF value from hackers. Applicable to fully fabricated systems needing security system upgrades"
MIT,Designing Universal Influenza MedicalCountermeasures,Case number: #22030L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/designing-universal-influenza-medical-countermeasures,"This technology is a universal flu vaccine that aims to prevent and treat seasonal variants of influenza A and B. Therefore, it is relevant to companies in the vaccine and biologics industries.\n\nTechnology: This technology is a prophylactic vaccine to protect against influenza A and B. The vaccine is composed of at least one polypeptide making up an influenza viral protein. Traditionally, the yearly vaccination polypeptides selected contain intact viral surface proteins like hemagglutinin and neuroaminidase. The highly antigenic hypervariable residues are the primary target of the body’s immune response to influenza infections and mutate annually. Non-hypervariable residues are much less prone to annual variation and are common to multiple influenza strains. In this vaccine, hypervariable antigenic amino acid residues in the polypeptides are substituted with non-antigenic amino acid residues that are stable and enable normal protein folding. By triggering B cell activity and antibody production, the vaccine is expected to program the immune system to recognize and protect against most variants of influenza, making it a universal influenza vaccine. A variation of this strategy will enable T-cell responses to cells infected with influenza and could be developed as an alternative or complimentary vaccine.\n\nProblem Addressed: While there are effective vaccines available for influenza A and B, the vaccine compositions must be reevaluated yearly to account for new strains emerging due to antigenic shift and drift. This system demands constant analysis of the circulating flu strains each year, and thus relies on imperfect predictions. Since inaccurate predictions lead to vaccine “mismatches,” or vaccines that protect against strains other than the ones circulating, there is a need for a vaccine that can effectively target various influenza strains more broadly, for either generating an immunogenic response as a vaccine or prompting the production of antibodies as a therapeutic.\n\nAdvantages: Can be used for both protection against and treatment for influenza, unlike current flu vaccines. Applies to a variety of Influenza A and B strains without relying on constant surveillance of circulating strains, saving time and resources"

The first two-dimensional material is patterned to define at least one void through which an exposed region of the growth substrate is exposed. Seed molecules are selectively deposited either on the exposed region of the growth substrate or on the patterned first two-dimensional material. A second two-dimensional material that is distinct from the first two-dimensional material is then grown from the deposited seed molecules.

The intersection region may exhibit current crowding in response to imbalances in current densities applied to channels connected to intersection region. The current crowding may form a hot spot, in which the superconducting device may exhibit a measurable resistance. In some cases, a three-terminal superconducting device may be configured to sense an amount of superconducting current flowing in a channel or loop without having to perturb the superconducting state or amount of current flowing in the channel.

MIT,Ultrafast Broadband Single Photon Detector Based on Cavity-Enhanced Atomic AbsorptionSpectroscopy,Case number: #17868,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/ultrafast-broadband-single-photon-detector-based,"A single photon detector (SPD) includes a resonator to store probe photons at a probe wavelength and an absorber disposed in the resonator to absorb a signal photon at a signal wavelength. The absorber is also substantially transparent to the probe photons. In the absence of the signal photon, the resonator is on resonance with the probe photons, thereby confining the probe photons within the resonator. Absorption of the signal photon by the absorber disturbs the resonant condition of the resonator, causing the resonator to release multiple probe photons. A photodetector (PD) then detects these multiple probe photons to determine the presence of the signal photon."
MIT,Guidance of Beveled TipMicrocapillaries,Case number: #19783,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/guidance-beveled-tip-microcapillaries,"This technology is a novel microcapillary design with a beveled tip to facilitate guided insertion of medical probes to internal soft tissue sites for a variety of medical interventions, including infusion and withdrawal of fluid, electrical stimulation, and photo-stimulation.\n\nTechnology: This invention introduces a beveled tip to the distal end portion of microcapillary medical probe used for insertion into soft tissues, such as the brain. The probe may include devices for drug delivery, fluid withdrawal, or electrical stimulation/monitoring. The geometry of the beveled tip is critical to producing the asymmetric force and deflection required for non-linear steering of the probe into the target tissue, the angle of the beveled tip correlates to the radius of curvature of the insertion path. The relationship between beveled tip angle design and trajectory allows for anatomical targeting that is highly predictable and reproducible.\n\nProblem Addressed: Targeted therapy to the brain through implanted devices is an attractive alternative to systemic drug administration for the treatment of neurological disorders, including epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. The use of deep brain stimulation probes comprised of microcapillaries has become increasingly common for this application. To reduce the risk of brain trauma during procedure, conventional microcapillaries are thin, and sometimes have diameters smaller than that of a human hair. This quality makes them prone to breaking during insertion and necessitates the use of a larger guide shuttle, which obviates the potential for the microcapillaries to reduce tissue trauma and scarring. The present invention introduces a beveled tip to a microcapillary medical probe that can be steered independently to a target site in the soft tissue.\n\nAdvantages: Reduced risk of tissue trauma or scarring during medical probe insertion. Independent steering of a medical probe into soft tissue without the need of real-time imaging. Reproducible curved trajectory of medical probe based on angle of beveled tip"
MIT,Fractal Vane Rotors for RheologyMeasurements,Case number: #21794,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/fractal-vane-rotors-rheology-measurements,"This technology uses a novel vane cross-sectional structure and detachable textured sample container to measure flow properties of yield stress fluids with high accuracy, improving the process of analyzing yield stress fluids in a range of industrial, commercial, and academic settings. The technology has applications in a wide variety of consumer goods, construction products, and in the field of oil/gas exploration.\n\nProblem Addressed: Yield stress fluids are versatile materials that flow only when sufficient force is applied to them. They have significant applications in a wide variety of consumer goods (e.g., toothpaste, cosmetics, ketchup) and construction products (e.g., cement). A rheometer is used to measure the viscous flow properties of liquids, but current instrumentation poses several challenges to accurately analyzing yield stress fluids.\n\nAdvantages: Improves quantitative accuracy in measuring yield stress.

MIT,Model-based Control for Column-based Continuous Viral Inactivation ofBiopharmaceuticals,Case number: #21959,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/model-based-control-column-based-continuous-viral,"This invention is a low-cost, column-based viral inactivation system for use in continuous manufacturing of biologics, with applications in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing.\n\nTechnology: This invention is a low-cost, column-based viral inactivation system for use in continuous manufacturing of biologics. Notably, this system allows for precise control over the pH and residence time, which are parameters critical to product safety and quality. In this invention, input solution containing biologics is mixed with acid and pumped into a glass-packed column, where the solution is incubated for a time sufficient to inactivate enveloped viruses. Fluid pH is closely monitored by sensors and tightly regulated using a model-based, feedback control scheme. In addition, residence time distributions are periodically measured through inverse tracer experiments and used to adjust feed flow rates. The inventors demonstrate that the feedback control scheme enables fast and accurate regulation of the solution pH, with rapid startup and effective disturbance rejection. The inventors further determine that the system can correctly identify residence time changes and adjust feed flow rates to meet residence time setpoints. Such suppression to pH and residence time disturbances is essential for ensuring effective viral clearance with minimal degradation of product quality. Importantly, the inventors demonstrate that the system can effectively and consistently inactivate bacteriophage while maintaining pH and residence time setpoints, even over extended periods of time of 15 hours. Incorporating this invention into continuous biomanufacturing systems can increase productivity, improve product quality, and enhance patient safety.\n\nProblem Addressed: Continuous manufacturing of biologics, such as antibodies, is attracting significant interest due to a number of benefits over traditional manufacturing systems, including lower costs, reduced processing times, and improved product consistency and quality. However, an important challenge during continuous biomanufacturing is the integration of effective, continuous viral clearance systems. Viral clearance techniques, including a low pH hold to inactivate enveloped viruses, are critical for minimizing viral contamination risks and ensuring patient safety. Previously invented approaches for integrating low pH holds into continuous processes lack sufficient control over key process parameters, such as operating pH and residence time. There is a need for tightly controlled, viral clearance systems that can be integrated into continuous biomanufacturing processes and ensure product quality and safety.\n\nAdvantages: Low-cost, column-based viral inactivation system for use in continuous manufacturing of biologics. Feedback control scheme allows for fast and accurate regulation over key control parameters, including effective suppression of pH and residence time disturbances.

MIT,Novel Technique for Increasing Efficiency of 3DICFabrication,Case number: #18705L,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/novel-technique-increasing-efficiency-3dic,"Multi-layered devices can be used in military and commercial applications, which includes sensor processing, mission data recording, communication, and flight electronics. 3DICs can also be implemented in portable consumer electronics like cell phones, tablets, and computers.\n\nTechnology: This technology covers multilayer semiconductor devices and methods for fabricating a multi-layer semiconductor structure. A simultaneous fabrication of building blocks, and subsequent alignment, joining and interconnection through a via last or via first process generates a multi-layer semiconductor structure. This fabrication approach provides the thinnest possible active area cross section for a multi-tier, flip-chip capable, hybrid, 3DIC. Thin cross-sections lead to lighter and slimmer 3D structures, so packaging can be more efficient. The integrated circuit has a total 2n stacked chips where “n” is the number of bonding cycles. This method uses the minimum number of bonding steps and shorter cycle times to fabricate 3DIC since each bonding of an individual chip or chip stack uses single side bonding. The insulating layers are made of a multilayer oxide having at least one chemically activated, ultra-smooth bonding surface capable of bonding to another surface without any external force. This surface bonding technology, combined with the minimized number of bonds, lowers the cost of manufacturing the 3D stacked circuits.\n\nProblem Addressed: The trend toward miniaturization of electronic products necessitates smaller and more densely packed semiconductor structures. This has resulted in a demand for semiconductor packages which are relatively low loss, lightweight structures and which support increased electronic capabilities like increased density, mobility, and operational life. One solution to this demand is multilayer semiconductor structures or 3D integrated circuits. Fabricating these structures has been a costly and inefficient process since drilling through the insulator substrate can cause fracture and the final semiconductor product generally has worse performance than the 2D integrated circuit. Current 3D fabrication techniques have low processing speeds, high manufacturing costs, and take exorbitant amounts of time to create. The present devices and method promote reduced cycle times, cost-effective stacking alternatives and increased circuit efficiency.\n\nAdvantages: Possible increase in power performance through interconnect length reduction and proper die placement.

MIT,2-Stage Reverse Osmosis with High Permeability Membranes for Desalination of Seawater at HighRecovery,Case number: #18711,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/2-stage-reverse-osmosis-high-permeability-membranes,"The technology proposes the use of two stage reverse osmosis (RO) systems for significant energy savings when purifying brackish water, seawater, and produced water.\n\nTechnology: Design of the multi-stage RO system for water filtration\n\nProblem Addressed: Reverse osmosis (RO) is the leading method of desalination.  RO provides secure water resources amidst the increasing demand for water, reduction of water resources, and increasing pollution of water. Many current water desalination systems use a single-stage RO system, which operates at high pressure through the whole system, and therefore results in high energy consumption and operating cost. Previously, multistage RO systems have been proposed to reduce energy, but with few practical realizations. This technology proposes an optimized, two-stage RO system, with identification of the parameters needed to achieve excellent energy savings.  With seawater feed (32,000 ppm), energy savings up to 52% can be achieved at 90% recovery. At higher salinity feed (128,000 ppm), the two-stage RO system proves to be more beneficial. Energy savings can become significant at only 30% recovery, and savings increase to 24% at 65% recovery.\n\nAdvantages: Cheaper operational cost – uses less energy to purify water than the single stage RO system. Flexible set up – can adjust the distribution of RO membrane area between the stages and feed pressures at each of the stage to achieve energy savings. Amenable to scaling up system throughout– can increase feed stream volume by including additional pressure vessels in parallel. More energy savings with higher salinity feed – can also increase energy savings with higher permeability membranes and recovery rates"
MIT,Resonant Frequency Modulation for Regulation and Security in Wireless PowerTransfer,Case number: #18739,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/resonant-frequency-modulation-regulation-and-security,"This technology regulates and secures power transfer between compliant wireless chargers and devices. Through public authentication key protocol and resonant frequency modulation, this technology can provide wireless power to multiple devices at once, such as in Internet of Things (IOT) applications.\n\nTechnology: This technology employs a secure and cooperative power sharing method. It comprises of wireless resonant inductive power receivers that use a public authentication key protocol. Each receiver includes a public key that securely pairs with a private key only owned by a compliant charger, allowing for multiple devices to connect to one charger. The receivers also have a wireless detuning function to control the amount of power received from a charger based on different operating conditions (i.e., proximity and orientation of devices to the charger). This detuning functionality is possible through resonant frequency modulation between the two coupled coils in a receiver.\n\nProblem Addressed: Coupled inductors enable wireless recharging of personal electronics, wearable technologies, and IOT devices. Counterfeit wireless chargers that do not fulfil power specs of a device can send harsh transient signals, causing damage in the device’s battery and surrounding hardware. Secure hash algorithm (SHA) authentication protocols have been used to avoid charging problems between a charger-device pair. Unfortunately, these security protocols are not suitable for IOT systems, where a charger supplies power to multiple devices.\n\nAdvantages: Secure wireless power transfer.

Moreover, information derived from this invention can also aid management teams in structuring workforce attendance, healthcare leaders in allocating hospital resources, and public health officials in outlining travel guidelines and providing vaccine supply support.\n\nTechnology: This technology is a point-of-care testing strip, with a physical design akin to that of a pregnancy testing kit. Unique to this invention are the individual components consisting of a) a purified human domain of ACE2 protein (a coronavirus Spike protein target) that is embedded at the “control” line, and b) a recombinant protein that will bind antibodies bound to truncated Spike protein (the receptor binding domain portion) that is embedded at the ”test” line.\n\nProblem Addressed: With COVID-19 vaccines becoming globally available, monitoring the degree of immune protection is equally important as detecting the spread of viral infection when forming workforce and public health-related guidelines. To tell if an individual is protected from COVID-19, clinicians require knowledge of neutralizing antibody levels in blood. However, conventional lab methods hinder commercial adoption due to expensive reagent costs, slow turnaround time, and the requirement of a central facility with well-trained personnel. The inventors overcame these problems by designing a field-deployable testing strip for reading out COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies in the blood. This invention leverages a lateral flow assay format along with engineered and carefully tested design parts to detect neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus with robust sensitivity and specificity.\n\nAdvantages: Our Team.

MIT,Classical Optical Cryptography for High Speed CoherentSystems,Case number: #17994,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/classical-optical-cryptography-high-speed-coherent,"This technology poses a new cryptographic system specifically designed for optical networks. It can be used by government and commercial entities to protect valuable and confidential information from being stolen.\n\nTechnology: The scheme is based on band-spreading in a coherent transmission system and a receiver that operates at the quantum limit of coherent detection. A pseudo-random cipher-stream is used to band-spread an optical carrier with coded data. A legitimate receiver can use the agreed upon key to modulate its local oscillator to uncover the band-spread signal and as resultantly decipher the message. Meanwhile, an eavesdropper without a key will find the spread signal with too low signal-to-noise ratio to perform any useful determination of the message sequence.\n\nProblem Addressed: Security of optical communication systems is important to government and commercial users. If an eavesdropper can receive and decrypt an encrypted message, they can access and steal confidential information. Stream cipher-based cryptographic systems encrypt and decrypt messages using keys; however, they are vulnerable to attack if a key is used more than once. An adversary with sufficient computing power can analyze encryption traffic to break the cipher. The Inventors have developed a cryptographic scheme proven to be much more secure for applications in optical networks, making it impossible for an illegitimate receiver to break the cipher without sifting through a practically impossible amount of traffic.\n\nAdvantages: Encoding scheme approaches theoretical bounds of security based on Shannon Capacity Theorem. Addition of quantum noise further boosts system security"

Prior methods of preparation also frequently involve expensive reagents and particularized lab temperatures to enable the reactions. This technology discloses methods to prepare the same compounds using less expensive and volatile reagents and with less need to carefully control ambient temperature.\n\nAdvantages: Avoids use of liquid or gaseous hydrogen sulfide in preparation of useful compounds.

Once the shape is inputted, the process continues by identifying a route for a single-stranded RNA scaffold to trace throughout the desired shape. The process concludes by generating the sequences of the scaffold strand and optionally the nucleic acid sequence of the “staple strands”—the short strands which guide the folding of the scaffold into the desired shape. Identifying the route of the scaffold requires a multi-step process involving creating a spanning tree, which establishes connectivity between each vertex in the nanostructure. This spanning tree can be used to calculate a Euler circuit (a trail in a graph which visits every edge exactly once) to represent the path the scaffold traces. Nanostructures produced through this process may also contain a molecule such as a peptide nucleic acid (PNA), protein, lipid, etc. bound to or encapsulated within the structure.\n\nProblem Addressed: Scaffolded DNA origami has. previously been demonstrated. as a way of creating nanostructures made of folded DNA with user-defined geometries. However, RNA origami—the same principle as DNA origami but with RNA serving as the nucleic acid scaffold—has been explored less, with especially little focus on DNA/RNA hybrid origami (which is one embodiment of this technology that uses both DNA and RNA in the same nanostructure). In light of its potential for numerous clinical applications, there is a need for robust methods of producing 3D RNA-scaffolded origami. This technology meets this demand by outlining a process of creating customized RNA and DNA/RNA hybrid scaffolded origami with user-defined polyhedral geometry. RNA origami offers unique advantages not possible through DNA origami, such as biomedical delivery of mRNA, characterization of the tertiary structure of long RNAs, and production of artificial ribozymes.\n\nAdvantages: Production of custom-shaped RNA and DNA/RNA hybrid nanostructures. Can be conjugated with other molecules for extended applications. Variety of uses provides flexibility to a licensing company"
MIT,Switched Capacitor Energy BufferArchitecture,Case number: #20268,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/switched-capacitor-energy-buffer-architecture,"Photovoltaic (PV) system\nPV energy extraction\nSolar cells\n\nTechnology: The invented solar panel is a series of connected solar cells coupled in a layout that substantially reduces the amount of mismatch caused by an imbalance in solar irradiance between the sub-module strings. Within the system lies a switched-capacitor DC-DC converter with a plurality of conversion levels. A conversion level is selected to provide the maximum power current of the solar cell in order for the converter to increase overall array tracking efficiency. Also included is a grid-tie inverter for coupling a PV array to a power grid. The inverter ensures the system operates stably by relying on feedforward rather than feedback processes.\n\nProblem Addressed: Asymmetric PV strings can result from temperature variation, dirt, panel aging, or panel orientation. These asymmetries negatively impact tracking efficiency. To maximize energy extraction, distributed power conversion is employed to enable per-panel or sub-panel maximum-power-point-tracking (MPPT). There are three common architectures deployed in residential and commercial PV installations for delivering power to the grid: string inverters, micro-inverters, and DC-DC series power supplies working with a string inverter. Each of these systems has limitations. For example, they are typically constructed with magnetic components which are possibly obtained on a per-panel basis and increase manufacturing costs. High frequency switching complicates electromagnetic interface created by distributed converters.\n\nAdvantages: Increased efficiency in overall array tracking. Achieves high energy utilization and highly effective energy density. Reduced manufacturing cost"
MIT,Materials Exhibiting Biomimetic Carbon Fixation andSelf-Repair,Case number: #20907,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/materials-exhibiting-biomimetic-carbon-fixation-and,"This invention generates material hydrogels that grow and self-repair using atmospheric carbon dioxide and sunlight. Such materials are of interest to the transportation and construction industries as both will benefit from materials with self-repairing and carbon dioxide fixing properties.\n\nTechnology: Utilizing embedded, extracted chloroplasts, this invention creates a novel class of materials which can grow, repair, and strengthen using atmospheric carbon dioxide and solar energy. Isolated chloroplasts are placed on graphene oxide film, functionalized with immobilized glucose oxidase. The film is then immersed in a buffer such as 3-aminopropyl methacrylamide (APMA). The presence of ambient light and atmospheric carbon dioxide for 18 hours at room temperature results in the formation of a hydrogel around the chloroplasts. Glucose exported from chloroplasts is converted to gluconolactone by the action of the enzyme glucose oxidase and reacted under relatively mild conditions with APMA to generate the polymer matrix. The matrix embedded with chloroplasts swells in water and continually grows, strengthens, and self-repairs using atmospheric carbon dioxide fixation and ambient light. Water absorption and swelling can increase the hydrogel weight 115-fold in 48 hours. When a gluconolactone solution is added to the interface of two physically separated hydrogels, the result is the formation of extensively repaired gels which can sustain stringent deformation.\n\nProblem Addressed: Materials which can self-repair to correct damage have increased lifetimes and resistance against fatigue and acute mechanical stress. Current research to develop synthetic materials with self-repairing properties require one or more external stimuli (heating, pH, mechanical stress, UV light) to be initiated. These materials are therefore not self-sustaining. Materials that can autonomously detect and respond to damage are ideal but have only recently been introduced, each having sufficient limitations to preclude mass-scale application and commercialization. This invention creates a novel class of self-sustaining materials which can autonomously grow, repair and strengthen through carbon dioxide fixation in the presence of sunlight.\n\nAdvantages: Infinitely self-sustaining, self-repairing hydrogel that fixes carbon dioxide in the presence of sunlight. Carbon dioxide fixation using chloroplasts or semiconducting photocatalysts"
MIT,Low Volume FluidOxygenator,Case number: #19949,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/low-volume-fluid-oxygenator,"This technology is a low volume fluid organ-on-a-chip system, including a specialized low volume fluid oxygenator. The system can help optimize a method of mimicking human physiology and can therefore serve as a tool in research and preclinical drug discovery.\n\nTechnology: The device is made up of a fluidic top plate and a pneumatic bottom plate with an elastomeric polyurethane membrane in between. The top plate contains at least one lane, within which there is at least one cell culture well, fluid oxygenator, and pump system. The oxygenator provides oxygen for the cells in culture to replicate physiological conditions. The oxygenator may feature a separate path for oxygenating fluid, which enables controlling and measuring fluid oxygen concentration, shortening diffusion length, and diffusing oxygen passively. The technology supports reduced fluid volumes, as it circulates fluid volumes below 1000 µL and ideally below 500 µL.\n\nProblem Addressed: Preclinical testing for a drug’s safety and efficacy is an important step developers must take before clinical trials can begin. However, animal models used for this testing do not always translate to human physiology, leading to failures in clinical trials and the rejection of some drugs viable in humans. Organ-on-a-chip systems offer a more accurate simulation of human physiology through the use of natural or engineered tissues grown in microfluidic chips. There is a demand, however, for organ-on-a-chip systems with low circulating volumes of fluid to avoid the challenges and negative effects that dilution has on the accuracy, ease of use, and cost of organs-on-chips.\n\nAdvantages: Easier detection of biomarkers produced in low quantities with less dilution. Promotion of intercellular communication with less dilute autocrine compounds. Less resources used because less drug mass is required to reach same initial concentration. More accurate drug exposure over time compared to humans in vivo increases accuracy in modeling human response. Adjustable to culture cells with different oxygen demands at varying seeding densities"
MIT,Multi-dimensional Double Spiral (MDDS) Device for Integration of Sample Concentration andSeparation,Case number: #20884,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/multi-dimensional-double-spiral-mdds-device,"This technology is a novel device for sample concentration and separation that can be applied in the biomedical field for size-based isolation of desired cell types from a larger heterogeneous sample such as blood.\n\nTechnology: This technology is a MDDS device enabling both sample concentration and separation in a single device with a one inlet configuration that requires no additional sheath flow. The MDDS device is composed of sequentially connected two spiral channels having two different dimensions. The sample is injected through the inlet, and all the target particles become focused into the inner wall side as they pass through the first smaller-dimension spiral channel due to the strong net lift force. The focused stream in the first spiral channel directly feeds to the outer wall side of the second larger-dimension spiral channel through the S-shaped transition region. In the second spiral channel, due to the increased channel dimension, the net lift force toward the inner wall side become weaker so that target particles have different equilibrium positions depending on their size, resulting in their separation; in general, as particle size increases, the equilibrium position gets closer to the inner wall side. This MDDS device provides high separation resolution and efficiency for a wide variety of particle sizes due to the initial focusing in the first smaller-dimension spiral channel. For example, a blood sample can be loaded into this device to achieve accurate separation of red and white blood cells.\n\nProblem Addressed: Spiral microfluidic devices have been widely used as concentrators and separators for sample preparation. The position of particle focusing is mainly determined by the confinement ratio (CR) which is a ratio of particle diameter to channel hydraulic diameter - smaller channel dimensions enable smaller particles to be focused on the inner wall of the spiral. These devices are widely used as separators for large CR particles but cannot effectively separate small CR particles due to relatively smaller focusing force. To efficiently separate a wider range of CR particles, some devices have two inlets with additional sheath flow. The introduction of two inlets allows the device to achieve increased separation distance, resolution and efficiency, but ultimately increases flow complexity and reduces operating flexibility for a closed-loop system. The present invention is multi-dimensional double spiral (MDDS) device that enables concentration and separation of samples using a single inlet configuration to improve separation resolution and efficiency with a wide target size range.\n\nAdvantages: High-throughput isolation of differentially sized particles from biological samples. High separation resolution and efficiency. Simple single-input operation"
MIT,Method for Producing Phosphorus Chemicals from Wet ProcessPhosphate,Case number: #19984,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/method-producing-phosphorus-chemicals-wet-process,"Processed phosphorus has applications in the agricultural, battery, flame retardant, pharmaceutical, plastics, and electronics industries. Methods disclosed by this invention allow for cheaper and cleaner production of useful phosphorous compounds.\n\nTechnology: The method disclosed by this invention uses trichlorosilane, an inexpensive high production volume chemical used in the semiconductor and solar photovoltaic industries, to produce from phosphoric acid a new phosphorus-containing reagent, tetrabutylammonium bis(trichlorosilyl)phosphide. This silylphosphide salt and related reagents can serve as an intermediate to compounds traditionally derived in industrial settings from white phosphorus via processes also disclosed by this invention. Accessible compounds include primary and secondary alkyl phosphines, phosphonates, and hexafluorophosphates.\n\nProblem Addressed: Numerous phosphorous-containing compounds essential to modern industry are derived from white phosphorous. This extraordinarily hazardous material is produced from phosphate rock by the “thermal process,” a heavily polluting method that generates large volumes of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Phosphate minerals can also be processed by the cheaper and comparatively clean “wet process” to produce the phosphoric acid used in fertilizers, but historically there have not been methods for converting this phosphoric acid into high value fine chemicals. A method to convert wet process phosphoric acid into the fine chemicals required by the battery, flame retardant, pharmaceutical, plastics, and electronics industries would both green the processes and avoid hazardous intermediates.\n\nAdvantages: Cheaper and cleaner than traditional thermal process white phosphorous production"
MIT,Structured DNA Nanoparticle Platform for Protein- and Peptide-basedVaccines,Case number: #20929H,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/structured-dna-nanoparticle-platform-protein-and,"This technology is a structured DNA nanoparticle platform to display antigens used in protein- and peptide-based vaccines, particularly those for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The platform is also applicable to other infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.\n\nTechnology: The technology is a DNA nanostructure of a defined geometric shape—a polyhedron or 6-helix bundle—with two to 100 antigen copies bound to its surface. The number of copies, the distance between them, their location on the nanostructure, and other physical features serve to improve the immune response triggered by the antigen compared to a control nucleic acid nanostructure containing at least one identical antigen copy. For HIV vaccines, the antigen is an HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 (gp120) epitope. The technology can also include one or more moieties, including adjuvants, targeting molecules, and therapeutic agents, as well as a coating for increased stabilization and protection. To enhance immune response, these nanostructures can incorporate multiple copies of an immunostimulatory agent such as a toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist. The physical design of these immunostimulatory agents, as well as their locations on the nanostructure, provide increased immunostimulation compared to a single immunostimulatory agent.\n\nProblem Addressed: Protein- and peptide-based vaccines, a major class of vaccination strategies, have not been effective against HIV. HIV poses challenges to the generation of prophylactic immune responses because of the antigenic diversity of its viral proteins and its similarity to self-epitopes. Therefore, current vaccination efforts have been limited by either safety or efficacy issues, and the need remains for an effective HIV vaccine. This technology holds potential as a vaccine against HIV and, more broadly, as a method of improving the antigen-induced immune response in vaccination against other diseases.\n\nAdvantages: Has been shown to efficiently induce human B cell activation in vitro. There is currently no HIV vaccine and therefore no established successful competitor. This platform is not limited to HIV, as it could be applied to other infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancer"
MIT,Making Screens Safe for those withPhotosensitivity,Case number: #20349,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/making-screens-safe-those-photosensitivity,"This technology prevents seizures in those who have photosensitivity by learning to adjust videos in a way that makes them safe. A large fraction of the population, particularly children, are sensitive to bright flashes and changing patterns, with many developing headaches or other unpleasant feelings. This technology can benefit photosensitive consumers as well as large digital content providers seeking to provide safe viewing experiences.\n\nTechnology: This technology uses machine learning methods to detect and modify harmful stimuli in videos. In the forward pass, this technology generates a large dataset of videos. Each video is then corrupted with artifacts, such as flashing lights, which would adversely affect photosensitive individuals. In the inverse pass, the harmful videos created in the forward pass are transformed into innocuous videos without compromising the quality. This inverse pass is accomplished using neural networks that learn to detect and selectively suppress problematic regions. Videos lacking adverse stimuli remain unaffected. The resulting filter may then be generalized to a wide range of new videos.\n\nProblem Addressed: Photosensitivity is a prevalent condition in which visual stimuli, such as flashing lights, trigger seizures or other adverse reactions. Videos are common sources of these unsafe stimuli, and although there are efforts to reduce certain types of strobing, the range of problematic stimuli is broad, unpredictable, and difficult to filter against. The inventors have developed a method to actively detect and modify harmful stimuli in videos, thereby protecting photosensitive individuals from exposure. Importantly, this method can protect viewers against a wide range of problematic stimuli without degradation of video quality. This invention has broad consumer and business applications to ensure a safe visual environment for all photosensitive individuals.\n\nAdvantages: Method to detect and modify a broad range of harmful stimuli in videos. Filter can be tunable to individual photosensitivities or broadly applied to video platforms. Provides safe visual environments without degradation of video quality"
MIT,A Method and Apparatus for Volumetric 3DPrinting,Case number: #20598,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/method-and-apparatus-volumetric-3d-printing,"Kaleidoscopic 3D printing is best suited for large-scale fabrication of complex periodic microarchitectures. The massive production of microarchitectures with complex designs can be produced in parallel, making this technology ideal for rapid prototyping labs. It may also be used in trauma applications that require large-scale prints with small feature sizes. For instance, biological scaffolds, chemical reactors, and functional surfaces.\n\nTechnology: This invention provides an improved way for performing SLA 3D printing that produces objects of a finer quality more quickly in a more scalable manner. It uses a microdisplay to generate an image and an array lens that replicates the image to form a kaleidoscopic imaging pattern on a resin that forms the 3D printed object. The use of array-to-array imaging rather than one-to-one or one-to-array imaging introduces scalable printing at tens of centimeter2 scales without requiring specialized instruments such as scanning modules or mechanical stages. Projection-based SLA multiplies small feature sizes of several micrometers with a kaleidoscopic imaging system that reconstructs patterns over a large area.\n\nProblem Addressed: Coupling lithographic patterning with photopolymerization can create complex structures by sequential stacking of multiple layers. This process known as stereolithography (SLA) suffers from low scalability and a limit on the feature size of complex microstructures. A multi-focal point method has been approached to extend the fabrication area of two-photon polymerization SLA. This approach increases the fabrication area and reduces printing time but, the imaging optics still use a conventional one-to-one or one-to-array imaging system, thus the system still requires a serial scanning process. This limits the potential of scalable SLA due to the intrinsic lithographic scaling law of imaging systems. There is a need for scalable 3D printing systems that allow for large scale efficient printing without an undesirable loss of quality of the printed object.\n\nAdvantages: Use of one, sub-divided, light source lowers cost and complexity of operation. Increased scalability with use of array-to-array imaging system. Decreased restrictions on feature size"
MIT,Alum-Binding Peptides for Prolonging Antigen Exposure and Augmenting Antigen-Specific ImmuneResponses,Case number: #19964HJ,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/alum-binding-peptides-prolonging-antigen-exposure-and,"This adjuvant-enhancing technology can potentially be applied to any protein antigen based vaccine.\n\nTechnology: Alum is a commonly used adjuvant known to increase the immune response to a vaccine. This technology is a peptide that contains phosphoserine repeats, which bind alum, and a maleimide functional group that can be reacted with protein antigens at cysteine residues to facilitate a stable interaction between the protein antigen and alum. Standard vaccine compositions are only loosely absorbed to the alum surface, and the antigen diffuses away from the alum at the injection site within 2-3 days. This conjugating technology increases the stability of the alum-antigen interaction in serum, and leads to stable alum-antigen association for two weeks in an. in vivo. mouse model. Importantly, the increased retention of the antigen with alum leads to increased antibody titers against the protein antigen, and in a mouse model the inventors demonstrate 10-fold higher antibody titer in comparison to standard alum compositions. Additionally, the orientation of the protein antigen adsorption to alum can be precisely controlled to focus the immune response to particular protein motifs.\n\nProblem Addressed: In the United States, children commonly receive at least 10 recommended immunizations, most of which also require two to four booster dosages. The requirement for boosters both increases healthcare costs and decreases patient compliance due to the need for repeated return visits. Technologies that enhance the immune response from a single dosage could help to solve the issues associated multi-dose immunizations. These inventors have engineered a peptide that enhances immune responses in vaccines by conjugating protein antigens directly to alum adjuvants.\n\nAdvantages: Simple incorporation with already established vaccine formulations. Enhanced antigen retention. Improved immune response with 10x higher antibody titer. Control of protein antigen orientation"
MIT,Methods for Evaluating Treatments and Physiology in Human Patients using Intravenous Alpha-2 Adrenergic AntagonistAgents,Case number: #20646P,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/methods-evaluating-treatments-and-physiology-human,"This technology proposes methods for the intra-operative monitoring of patients by providing an agent to reverse the effects of general anesthesia and sedatives. This technology is relevant to: \n\n\n	Outpatient anesthesia facilities in which patient speech, motor, and cognitive functions are assessed before patient release. \n	\n\n\n\n	Surgery operations, such as neurosurgery or spinal surgery.\n\nProblem Addressed: Regaining consciousness after the use of general anesthesia and/or sedatives is often a lengthy process. Due to the lack of agents to reverse anesthesia induced unconsciousness, clinicians usually wait until the effects of general anesthesia have waned to assess a patient’s neurological and motor functions. Waiting to assess the patient until after an operation can mean less feedback on how surgical technique has impacted the patient, as well as the ability to identify surgical errors.\n\nAdvantages: Spotting surgical errors in mid-operation or shortly post operation can reduce the number of secondary operations.. Reducing the time patients spend in facilities recovering from anesthesia can reduce health care costs.. The technology can be used to respond to an emergency during surgery in which a patient needs to become conscious."
MIT,Manuka Honey Microneedle: Methods andUses,Case number: #21539,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/manuka-honey-microneedle-methods-and-uses,"A new drug delivery device utilizes honey as either the ""drug,"" carrier, or adjuvant for drug delivery. Manuka Honey Microneedles (MHMs) can stimulate wound healing and prevent or treat infections by delivering drugs beneath an intact dermal layer or into deeper layers of infected tissue. Additionally, MHMs can serve as a microneedle base material for administering other drugs, such as vaccines.\n\nTechnology: The synthesis method described in this patent involves using a material with medicinal properties that is already FDA-approved for wound care, and which can serve as a drug delivery substrate. This method enables the creation of up to 100% pure honey microneedles, maintaining their natural chemical and enzymatic properties without the need for high heat, unlike other sugar-based microneedles. The gentle synthesis process allows for the inclusion of drugs or proteins without damaging or degrading them, which is particularly valuable for delivering delicate therapeutics, such as RNA- or DNA-based treatments. Using honey as the microneedle base, known for its antibacterial and wound-healing properties, allows the microneedles to be used for wound management or as a drug delivery tool, promoting healing and reducing the chance of infection at the delivery site. Additionally, honey may act as a natural adjuvant, providing immunostimulant properties and enhancing drug uptake through the physical stimulation of microneedling. In dermatology, this technique can promote collagen formation, prevent infection, and encourage short-acting local inflammation, enhancing blood flow and tissue regeneration, which is beneficial for scar reduction and minimizing fine lines and wrinkles.\n\nProblem Addressed: The synthesis of sugar-based microneedles typically requires high-temperature conditions, which may restrict the ability to drug load specific targets within the microneedle itself. Microneedles penetrate the skin and result in a defect in the epithelial barrier, increasing the potential risk of acquiring an infection at the site of microneedle penetration. Manuka Honey, an FDA-approved product for the treatment of complex wounds, possesses natural antibiotic and antifungal properties. However, the current methods of applying the honey to wounds, through a gel or cream or on a bandage, only reach the superficial portion of the wound and may not effectively treat deeper infections, such as cellulitis.\n\nAdvantages: Methods for the synthesis of MHMs which retains the enzymatic and chemical characteristics of the honey. The method of MHM synthesis is gentle enough to enable the loading of other drugs into the microneedle base itself, without an additional coating step. The MHMs combine two FDA-approved techniques: microneedling and Medical Grade Manuka Honey. MHMs can be a combined device and therapeutic and may be a way to administer sensitive drug loads, vaccines, or treat complicated infections – such as those with antibiotic resistant bacteria or fungal infections."
MIT,Printing of Carbon Nanotubes inFluids,Case number: #20931,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/printing-carbon-nanotubes-fluids,"With increasing dependence on technology there is a growing need of more efficient methods of power generation, transmission, and conversion. Printing of elongated nanostructures through extrusion-based additive manufacturing allows for the fabrication of planar and three-dimensional (3D) features and objects that are incorporated into specialty electronics, power transformers, and high-frequency wireless transmitters and receivers.\n\nTechnology: The invention is directed to tailoring the structure of freeform CNT macrostructures through extrusion-based additive manufacturing for fabrication of planar and three-dimensional features and objects. Ink containing nanomaterials can be extruded into a fluid to precipitate into a fiber that can be used to form solid structures. The fluid can include a coagulant that promotes rapid solidification in the precipitation of fibers. The fluid can be disposed into a bath that is in fluid communication with the extruded ink. The printed and precipitated solid can have tunable properties and achieve macrostructures of melt pools, necked tips, or elongated free form objects.\n\nProblem Addressed: Disadvantages of existing 3D printing techniques include limited customization of properties across a surface area and do not produce robust mechanical properties.  Resistive losses resulting from material property limitations are a major source of inefficiency for many power conversion and generation devices. To reduce these losses, lower weight and higher conductivity materials are necessary. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and similar elongated nanostructures achieve these material properties, but only at the nanoscale. Macrostructures of these elongated nanostructures have failed to achieve the properties of their nanoscale counterparts through existing 3D printing techniques.\n\nAdvantages: High electrical conductivity per density. High thermal conductivity, even at elevated temperatures. High current-carrying capacity. High tensile strength. Great corrosion resistance. Low overall production costs and simple processing"
MIT,Synthesis of Fluorescent Quantum Defects on CarbonNanotubes,Case number: #20911,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/synthesis-fluorescent-quantum-defects-carbon,"The inventors have developed an efficient and low-cost method for synthesizing fluorescent quantum defects on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). This invention is useful for applications that require the emission of infrared light from a single-photon source, including quantum communication, cryptography, and medical imaging.\n\nTechnology: This technology is a fast, efficient, and scalable method for synthesizing fluorescent defects on SWCNTs through oxygen doping. To introduce fluorescent defects on SWCNTs, the inventors utilize UV radiation with hypochlorite ions and a surfactant, generating oxygen atoms that then attach onto the SWCNT wall. Production of oxygen-doped SWCNTs using this strategy occurs at least 24 times faster than existing methods while minimizing the generation of non-fluorescent defects. Furthermore, the low cost of reagents in this invention enables scalable production of oxygen-doped SWCNTs. This invention is useful for applications that require infrared excitation/emission wavelengths or room-temperature single-photon sources, such as medical imaging and quantum communication.\n\nProblem Addressed: SWCNTs are useful, particularly in the imaging fields, for their ability to emit light over a broad range of wavelengths. The optical properties of SWCNTs can be adjusted though chemical modifications of the nanotube surface. In particular, synthesis of fluorescent quantum defects on SWCNTs, such as through oxygen doping, can enable the generation of short-wave infrared light. Production of light within this wavelength range is especially useful for medical imaging, as it allows for higher resolution imaging. Furthermore, SWCNTs with quantum defects can serve as room-temperature single-photon sources for quantum communication. However, current methods to introduce fluorescent quantum defects on SWCNTs are slow, expensive, and not scalable.\n\nAdvantages: Efficient and low-cost method for synthesis of fluorescent quantum defects, allowing for scalable production. Ideal for applications that require short wave infrared or single-photon emission properties, including medical imaging and quantum communication"
MIT,A Microbial Electrochemical Technology to Detect and Degrade OrganophosphatePesticides,Case number: #23586,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/microbial-electrochemical-technology-detect-and,"This technology aims to detect and dismantle organophosphate (OP) pesticides such as parathion and paraoxon by utilizing engineered microbial co-cultures of E. coli and S. oneidensis. Its primary application is in agriculture, serving as a defense against health risks associated with pesticide exposure. Furthermore, it holds potential for addressing various other harmful environmental pollutants.\n\nTechnology: This technology works by degrading and detecting OPs through engineered microbes. First, engineered. E. coli. is used as a scaffold to express and display on its surface an organophosphate hydrolase (OPH), parathion hydrolase, which degrades OPs. Using. E. coli. as a platform to express the OPH allows for greater stability, bypassing the challenges of protein handling that arise with the use of OPHs on their own. The degradation of OPs yields a byproduct called. p. -nitrophenol (. p. -NP). In response to this byproduct, the second engineered microbe in the system,. S. oneidensis. , generates a current through the process of Extracellular Electron Transfer (EET). The. S. oneidensis. microbe is engineered to express a transcription factor called DmpR (dimethyl phenol regulator), which activates its promoter Pdmp in response to. p. -NP. The microbe is engineered such that Pdmp controls a periplasmic EET protein, CymA. This means that when DmpR activates Pdmp in response to. p. -NP, CymA is expressed. The expression of CymA completes the EET pathway, generating a measurable electrical current. Since this current is proportional to the amount of OP detected, OP levels can be quantitatively measured.\n\nProblem Addressed: OPs, the most widely-used pesticides in industrialized countries, cause environmental contamination and pose a serious threat to human health following exposure. While there are already technologies available to either detect. or. degrade OPs, there is no current method to perform both functions in a single system as offered by this technology. A single system would simplify the remediation process, making it easier for farmers to remove OPs from their environment. This approach also offers microbial stability and viability in degrading OPs, as well as greater accuracy and specificity in detecting them.\n\nAdvantages: Provides both detection and degradation of harmful OPs in a single assay or application. Detects OP degradation products at the level of parts per million, providing more accurate. measurements than those from absorbance and fluorescence sensors. Detection is specific to. p. -NP, preventing false readouts due to the presence of off-target phenols in natural systems. Increased. storage life due to freeze-drying of. E. coli cells"

Through public authentication key protocol, this technology can provide wireless power to multiple devices at once, such as in Internet of Things (IOT) applications.\n\nProblem Addressed: Coupled inductors enable wireless recharging of personal electronics, wearable technologies, and IOT devices. Counterfeit wireless chargers that do not fulfil power specs of a device can send harsh transient signals, causing damage in the device’s battery and surrounding hardware. Secure hash algorithm (SHA) authentication protocols have been used to avoid charging problems between a charger-device pair. Unfortunately, these security protocols are not suitable for IOT systems, where a charger supplies power to multiple receivers.\n\nAdvantages: Secure wireless power transfer. Wirelessly charge multiple devices using one compliant charger"
MIT,Mucin-inspired Glycopolymers Can Selectively Kill Vaginal Pathogen Gardnerella Vaginalis Without Impacting Growth of Beneficial LactobacillusCrispatus,Case number: #24459,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/mucin-inspired-glycopolymers-can-selectively-kill,"This technology uses mucins and mucin-inspired glycopolymers to destroy biofilms and reduce pathogenic Gardnerella Vaginalis bacteria commonly found during bacterial vaginosis (overgrowth of bacteria) in the vagina while not harming beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus Crispatus.\n\nTechnology: This technology uses mucin-inspired glycopolymers, polymers mimicking certain properties of mucus, to alter the microbial environment and reduce growth of pathogenic. G. vaginalis. . Certain sugar molecules of mucins, such as galactose, act as signaling molecules to selectively trigger a reduction in pathogenic behavior, and beneficial bacteria are not harmed in the process. To create the mucin-inspired glycopolymers, galactose is grafted onto silk fibroin or norbornene forming a synthetic mucus. Presence of the galactose sugar molecule leads to reduced biofilms, less pathogenic bacterial growth, and decreased endocervical cell death. The mucin-inspired glycopolymers can also be coupled with probiotic treatment to further help in rebalancing the microbiome.\n\nProblem Addressed: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an imbalance in bacterial growth leading to an increased number of pathogenic bacteria such as. Gardnerella vaginalis. (. G. vaginalis. ). BV is associated with an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections and with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Currently, the most common treatment is broad spectrum antibiotics via oral or topical application, which over time contributes to antibiotic resistance.  Furthermore, the antibiotic usage can itself create an imbalance in the body’s microbiome, which can increase susceptibility to other infections and complications. A vaginal microbiome transplant is an alternative, but donors are limited, and the procedure is more expensive than broad spectrum antibiotics. The mucin-inspired glycopolymers of this invention avoid disrupting the microbiome’s balance, while subduing the overgrowth of. G. vaginalis. for less than a microbiome transplant.\n\nAdvantages: Avoids the use of antibiotics and thus complications due to good bacteria being killed indiscriminately.. Selectively reduces pathogenic bacteria, such as. G. vaginalis. .. Can be coupled with probiotic treatments.. Cheaper, easier alternative than vaginal microbiome transplants..

MIT,High Consistency and High Yielding Resistive SwitchingDevices.,Case number: #21436,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/high-consistency-and-high-yielding-resistive,"Resistive switching (RS) devices are actively pursued by semiconductor industries for next generation resistive RAM. RS devices will soon replace transistors as fundamental units in next-generation computer circuits. Large scale RS arrays are used in machine learning applications, hardware neuromorphic networks, and hardware-implemented matrix multiplications.\n\nTechnology: This resistive switching device combines multiple technologies in a way that revolutionizes the field of RS devices. A simple RS device consists of a top electrode, an oxide material, and a bottom electrode. RS behavior comes from the formation and dissipation of an oxygen vacancy filament between these layers. Certain processing factors are paramount in achieving good switching characteristics that have not been identified in the prior art. Factors affecting device behavior include material choices for the electrodes and oxide as well as thicknesses of individual layers. Other control parameters can be tuned when integrating RS devices into large arrays. For example, doping is a rich tuning parameter as it grants the choice of dopant material and doping profile/distribution. Gold metal dopants improve switching consistency and eliminate the need for a low-yield electroforming step during fabrication. Another strategy is fragmentation of a thick oxide layer into multiple thinner oxides. This lifts the restriction of needing to find different, but suitable, oxide materials to tap into the benefits of using multilayer films. The multiple oxide layers significantly improve consistencies across cycles and across devices while sharpening the LRS to HRS transition. These features are important for achieving good switching characteristics.\n\nProblem Addressed: An ideal RS device operates reversibly and has consistent switching behaviors for each cycle. The challenge in producing marketable dual purpose computation and memory units lies in the poor device yields and inconsistent switching behavior of the RS unit. The poor yields and device variations arise from the stochastic nature of the formation of filaments in the insulating dielectric layer structure, causing I-V curves to differ substantially between cycles and between devices. The cycling between high resistance states (HRS) and low resistance states (LRS) can also terminate abruptly via a permanent breakdown of the dielectric layer.\n\nAdvantages: Improved switching consistency with sharper transitions between low resistance and high resistance states. High device fabrication yields and switching consistencies, both across cycles and across devices; lowers manufacturing costs due to less wasted material"
MIT,Programmable CRISPR-Responsive SmartMaterials,Case number: #21161JY,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/programmable-crispr-responsive-smart-materials,"This technology is a programmable, stimuli-responsive biomaterial with broad applications in medicine and biotechnology, including tissue engineering, molecular diagnostics, environmental monitoring, bioelectronics, and microfluidics.\n\nTechnology: This technology is a programmable, CRISPR-based hydrogel with a wide range of abilities, including release of biomolecules or regulation of electric circuits, in response to specific DNA targets. The hydrogel is constructed using single-stranded DNA sequences as key structural elements or as linkers to cargo, such as fluorescent molecules. Following introduction of a user-defined, external DNA stimuli, a Cas enzyme and guide RNA (gRNA) complex cleaves the single-stranded DNA sequences in the hydrogel, leading to the restructuring of the polymeric material or release of the bound cargo. Importantly, this technology eliminates the need to encode target-sequence specificity into the gel structure. Instead, specificity of the Cas enzyme is easily modulated through simple replacement of the gRNA sequence. The inventors have demonstrated that a wide range of different payloads, including fluorescent molecules, active enzymes, and encapsulated nanoparticles and live cells, can be released from hydrogels at a controllable rate upon exposure to low concentrations of DNA stimuli. Furthermore, this smart biomaterial can act as a stimuli-responsive electric fuse and a controllable valve in fluidic devices.\n\nProblem Addressed: Stimuli-responsive materials are highly attractive in medicine and tissue engineering, due to their ability to modulate their chemical and mechanical properties in response to environmental cues. In particular, hydrogels that respond to DNA in the environment have emerged as useful biomaterials, such as for detection of pathogens or disease-causing mutations. However, current DNA-responsive hydrogels are not easily adaptable for detection of new nucleotide sequences, and require high concentrations of the DNA stimulus, greatly constraining the programmability of these biomaterials. To address these issues, the inventors have utilized the CRISPR-Cas system to develop a highly programmable and versatile DNA-responsive hydrogel.\n\nAdvantages: DNA stimuli-responsive hydrogel that leverages the specificity and programmability of the CRISPR-Cas system. Target specificity is easily modulated through simple replacement of the guide RNA sequence. Low concentrations of DNA stimulus are required to induce response. Demonstrated uses for this versatile technology include controlled release of bound payloads (e.g., fluorescent molecules, active enzymes, nanoparticles, or live cells), degradable electrical fuses, and valves in fluidic devices.

MIT,Process for Fabricating High Aspect-Ratio Tapered NanoconeStructures,Case number: #14861KDE,,https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies/process-fabricating-high-aspect-ratio-tapered,"Nanocone structured materials can be used for self-cleaning, anti-glare displays (e.g., glasses, windshields) and increasing solar panel efficiency. The material's unique structure allows for both antifogging and self-cleaning. This technology is a fabrication method for nanocone structures.  \nProblem Addressed   \nNanostructured materials are utilized for their superior optical and wetting properties, such as antireflection and superhydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. However, fabricating defect-free nanostructured surfaces with multiple functionality has remained a challenge. Conventional technologies use a single hardmask in the etching process, which limits the final height of the material to the material of the hardmask and its thickness. The proposed technology is based on multi-step plasma etching and uses shrinking masks to achieve more flexible choices in materials and thickness for better control of the height and profile of the nanocone structures.  \nTechnology\nThe key feature of this technology is its utilization of mask materials that are etched, but at a much slower rate than the substrate, which allows the tapered nanocone profile. By controlling the etching rate and size of the mask material, the nanocone structure is determined. These nanocones have the advantage of multifunctionality (i.e. antifogging and self-cleaning) because of their high aspect ratio.  \nAdvantages     \n\nAnti-glare\nAnti-fog\nSelf-clean\nCompatible and adaptable to conventional 2-D lithography techniques\nBoth aspect ratio and profile of nanocone structure can be controlled"
