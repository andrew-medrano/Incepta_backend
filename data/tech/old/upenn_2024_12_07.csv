University of Pennsylvania,"Intuitive, easily operated bubble user interface for augmented reality",,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/42216,"An augmented reality user interface that displays information as a series of nested bubbles in 3D virtual space.Problem:Augmented reality (AR) is the process of superimposing graphics/sounds to what a person sees, typically by adding modifications to what is seen through a tablet or phone camera (e.g. social media filters, Pokémon GO). With widespread application from games to apps to enhanced museum experiences, it represents a rapidly growing field with a market size of 18 bn USD worldwide.As its popularity increases, so does the need for more sophisticated ways of presenting information in AR. However, designing an effective AR user interface necessitates the unique challenge of translating traditional 2D methods of organizing information into 3D.Solution:The inventors tackled the problem by taking inspiration from the directory tree organization of desktop files and folders. Rather than attempt to create an entirely new way of organizing information as others have done, they instead took advantage of a data structure with which many are already intimately familiar, resulting in a creative, user-friendly solution especially well-suited for AR.Technology Overview:The inventors designed a user interface in which information is visualized as nested bubbles superimposed on what is seen on a virtual screen. For example, when a user views his/her surroundings through a smartphone camera, an app utilizing the interface would display bubbles on screen as part of the environment. The bubbles are organized into a hierarchal structure (called the “foam”) similar to folders in a typical file system. Users can navigate the foam by interacting with their screen and/or moving in real space. The information associated with each bubble is displayed on screen in response to the user’s actions.Advantages:Unlike other AR interfaces, takes advantage of an intuitive structure already familiar to most usersDesigned to have widespread application in education, commerce, and beyond, instead of being limited to one AR application as other user interfaces are (e.g. an app)Offers additional features to enhance user engagement, including shadows for realism, popups, sound effects, and cues for the user to look aroundBubble User Interface. An example of how a nested hierarchy of information nodes may be organized abstractly as bubbles (drawn as circles) is depicted in (a). Note the hierarchy need not be as regular as pictured; bubbles can have different numbers of sub-bubbles. An example of how the interface may appear to users is shown in (b).Stage of Development:ConceptProof of ConceptBench PrototypeIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingResearch MaterialsReference Media:Lane, SH et al,SIGGRAPH ’20: ACM SIGGRAPH Appy Hour, 2020Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:21-9466-tpNCSWeb Published:11/2/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/42216"
University of Pennsylvania,Improving Diagnosis and Treatment of Sarcoidosis,23-10329,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/55694,"Using a blood or tissue biomarker to improve diagnosis and identification of a new targeted treatment.Problem:Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that can affect any organ, predominantly the lung, skin, and the lymphatic system. Symptoms include difficulty breathing, extreme fatigue, skin inflammation, and joint pain. Sarcoidosis compromises patients’ quality of life and increases patient mortality. Even though the disease was identified in the late 1800s, confirmatory diagnostic tests and targeted treatments are still lacking.Solution:Identified novel biomarkers and targets for sarcoidosis via single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry.Technology:Using single-cell RNA sequencing of affected and unaffected patient skin, the inventors identified that type 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) were enriched in sarcoid skin. The affected skin also showed a significant increase in CXCR4 and CXCL12, which are a potent chemokine receptor and ligand, respectively, that function as homing agents for immune cells. Inhibition of CXCR4 with the FDA-approved CXCR4 inhibitor, Plerixafor, reduced granuloma formation in a mouse model of sarcoidosis.Advantages:Novel method to diagnose and to monitor sarcoidosis disease activity in blood or affected tissue.Targeted therapy of sarcoidosis with reduced side effects.Figure 1.

University of Pennsylvania,"Eco-Friendly, Low-Maintenance Living Brick System for Sustainable Architecture",,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/55695,"A portable pot-like brick cassette encasing mycorrhizal fungi and alfalfa to promote plant growth and carbon sequestration.Problem:The building sector contributes approximately 40% of global carbon emissions related to energy use. Green walls have gained popularity as a carbon offsetting strategy due to their ability to sequester carbon from the atmosphere via plant photosynthesis. However, existing green building envelope methods often involve resource-intensive construction, relying on unsustainable materials, high energy expenditure, and costly maintenance.Solution:SimbioBrick is a versatile living system that harnesses plant-fungi symbiosis to support bio-receptive architecture or create outdoor flooring that paves walkways while offsetting building carbon emissions. It features a biologically driven modular design, produces indoor and outdoor oxygen, continuously sequesters carbon, retains water for self-irrigation, and aids in soil bioremediation. This scalable solution offers enormous potential for sustainable environmental remediation.Technology:SimbioBrick is a portable, multifunctional system that supports nutrient cycling by Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) while preserving its symbiotic relationship with alfalfa, the host plant. It contains fungal spores, seeds, water, and nutrient-storing hydrogels emulating wet soils.Constructed from 3D-printed clay bricks, the outer structure provides support and exposure to sunlight for photosynthesis, while the inner structure offers depth for fungal colonization, porosity, and sufficient drainage. The porous brick design enhances water retention and facilitates the expansion of AMF networks. The biologically driven geometry creates a habitable space for plant-fungi symbiosis while controlling moisture and sunlight exposure. The growing medium includes mycorrhizal inoculant and a nutrient solution-hydrated super absorbent polymer, enhanced with perlite for improved air permeability and root rot prevention.Advantages:The system requires minimal maintenance, including self-irrigation, and avoids the use of non-recyclable materialsThe system captures greater amounts of carbon through accelerated plant photosynthesis when deployed in urban settingsThe brick’s interlocking geometry enables self-support without additional materialsBiological behavior-driven SimbioBrick living brick system that captures carbon by enhancing plant-fungi symbiotic association. A 3D-printed clay cassette includes a sufficient watering system and porous surfaces for drainage and ventilation, allowing plant roots and mycorrhizal fungi to expand throughout the structure.

University of Pennsylvania,"Bilayer Solid-State Nanopores for the Tracking, Filtering and Guiding of DNA",,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/55678,"A bilayered solid-state nanopore material that senses and guides DNA and other biomolecules into homogeneous configurations.Problem:Current methods of DNA sensing and sequencing typically involve short read lengths, chemical labeling, labor-intensive sample preparation, and lack of portability. To minimize these issues during DNA sequencing, protein-based nanopores have been developed and commercialized for DNA sensing. However, these protein-based nanopores are not stable in the long term, and sequence collection cannot occur at high bandwidths. Additionally, the mechanism of DNA guidance, which varies depending on the protein identity and nanopore construction, limits DNA throughput.Solution:A solid-state bilayered nanoporous material allows for controlled configuration and sensing of DNA and other biomolecules. This approach does not require DNA labeling or pretreatment with enzymes, reducing sample preparation. This material is reusable, portable, stable for longer periods of time, and throughput speed can be modulated by varying the electrical potential applied to the system.Technology:A nanoporous material consisting of MoS2 and SiN guiding reusable (GURU) bilayers. As DNA passes through pores, the electrical field applied to the bilayer geometry helps pre-sort and detect DNA via electrical signals. The electric fields in the layered geometry have varying degrees of coupling, depending on the separation of the given bilayers. Electrical coupling influences the electrical conductance measured along with the number of nanopores, layer sizes, and the charges present on the given biomolecules and the material. This customizability provides electromechanical control over DNA, enabled by increased nanofabrication precision and the ability to obtain microsecond resolution detection of the biomolecules.Advantages:DNA is tracked across a 20-nanometer distance with approximately one microsecond time resolution, representing at least one order of magnitude improvement compared to tracking markers recently shown for labeled DNA, allowing for extremely high-resolution DNA detectionCustomizability of the material and geometry allows for variable electrical coupling, so DNA can be guided into a variety of shapes depending on the desired configuration using this technology, rather than the single configurational outcome typical of other nanoporous protein-based materialsUnlike other nanoporous or traditional DNA sensing and sorting platforms, this technology is portable, stable long-term, and reusable after acid washing(A) Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of SiN trenches with varying numbers of pores.

University of Pennsylvania,Origami-Inspired And Remotely Adjustable Pediatric Heart Implant,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/55635,"Pediatric pulmonary artery band (PAB) using origami-inspired fabrication that is remotely adjustable after implantation.Problem:Congenital heart defects affect 1% of births in the United States and can lead to irregular blood flow through the main pulmonary artery (MPA). A pulmonary artery band (PAB) is an implant that can be placed on the MPA to restrict blood flow. However, most PAB implants fail to accommodate growth in pediatric patients, which results in frequent reoperation and financial burden. Although remotely controlled PABs have been developed, they are mechanically complex, expensive, and prone to failure.Solution:Origami structures were incorporated into the PAB design for easy fabrication, rapid assembly, and multi-state stability. This PAB is minimally invasive and can be periodically adjusted using external magnetic fields to tune blood flow through the MPA.Technology:The geometric parameters of a square origami pattern were optimized to enable the origami-inspired PAB (OPAB) device to reconfigure to multiple states. A prototype was laser cut from a sheet of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), manually folded, and assembled using tape. Panels attached to the fold panels enable the OPAB to expand or collapse using external magnetic fields. Mechanical testing indicated that the device’s stability and shape can be predicted when adjusting the device to accommodate for patient growth. During simulated in- vivo testing, the OPAB prototype successfully restricted flow rates in a mock MPA tube.Advantages:Minimally invasive, biocompatible, and compatible with current treatmentsScalable design and easily fabricated with few constituent partsExternally adjustable using magnetic control, reducing the need for surgical reoperations(A) Illustration of the origami-inspired PAB (OPAB; in gray) constricting blood flow through the main pulmonary artery (MPA; in blue) using magnetic panels. (B) The OPAB prototype with tubing represents the MPA. (C) In a clinical setting, a surgeon would 1) place the OPAB around the patient’s MPA, 2) fully compress the OPAB to ensure range of motion, then 3) tune the inner diameter using magnetic fields until blood flow is restricted.Stage of Development:Bench PrototypeIntellectual Property:US Provisional Patent Application FiledReference Media:Unger, G. and Sung, C.,""Re-programmable Matter by Folding: Magnetically Controlled Origami that Self-Folds, Self-Unfolds, and Self-Reconfigures On-Demand.""8th International Meeting on Origami in Science, Mathematics, and Education; 2024 Jul 24U.S. National Science Foundation,""Folding the Future: The rise of origami-inspired robots""; 2024 Oct 10Penn Engineering: Medium,""Penn Engineering’s Cynthia Sung is developing ‘Interactive Robogami’; 2017 Sep 06Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:23-10185-01-TpNCSWeb Published:11/18/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/55635"
University of Pennsylvania,NetSpec: An Automatic And Fast Network Specification Synthesis Toolkit,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/55613,"A specification-by-example toolkit that generates formal network specifications using only input-output examples.Problem:Many modern computer systems run on networks like cloud clusters or distributed systems. However, the network protocols that support the operation and security of these systems are notoriously difficult to debug. Formal network specifications provide a solution to a wide variety of network related tasks such as verification, analysis, and debugging. However, very few network engineers possess expertise in both network operation and writing formal specifications, creating a significant barrier to the adaptation of said specifications.Solution:NetSpec is a toolkit that synthesizes highly expressive formal network specifications using input-output example pairs. It is best-first search algorithm is scalable to large networks and can automatically query the user for additional input-output examples in the case of ambiguous specifications. This implementation makes synthesis of formal specifications available to users without prior expertise.Technology:NetSpec generates formal network specifications such as declarative logic programs that can be verified with tools like Vericon and Flowlog. It has been tested on a set of twenty-three different network protocol types and synthesizes solutions at similar or better performance levels as existing solutions while also requiring fewer computer resources. The algorithm optimizes a score based on the fraction and number of tuples in the synthesized network. In each round of optimization, NetSpec either introduces new rules, introduces new literals to existing rules, or aggregates operators. The search algorithm continues until no new programs provide an improvement over the current solution.Advantages:Capable of synthesizing specifications for twenty-three benchmarks while existing solutions only work on less than halfRuns faster or at similar speed for individual benchmarks on a single thread while existing solutions are multi-threadedOnly requires input-output examples and no network specification expertise from the userQueries the user for additional inputs in the case of ambiguous specificationsArchitecture of NetSpec.

University of Pennsylvania,Adhesive Microparticle Formulation For Localized And Sustained Drug Delivery,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/55609,"A hairy, water-in-oil-in-water microemulsion for prolonged delivery of one or more active ingredients while adhering to target tissues.Problem:Microparticles are promising drug delivery platforms due to their biocompatibility and stability. However, existing particle-based drug delivery systems are unable to fulfill the needs for prolonged delivery of drugs to a given area, as they will circulate freely in the body instead of residing in their desired locations for a certain amount of time.Solution:The inventors have developed a water-in-oil-in-water microcapsule with sticky or hairy projections that lend strong adhesive properties and can be loaded with drugs. These microcapsules can remain in their desired location even under frequent clearing and achieve prolonged drug release.Technology:Adhesive microparticles are produced through evaporation-induced self-assembly of amphiphilic copolymers. Drugs are loaded in advance of a dual-emulsion-based process, whereby microfluidic systems are used to combine aqueous and oil phases at the appropriate ratios. Finally, emulsions are processed further to produce the adhesive and hairy dendritic projections of the microcapsules.Advantages:Unique hairy structure endows the dendritic particles with stronger adhesion properties compared to traditional spherical particlesSustained drug release up to 20 hoursEncapsulate both water-soluble and -insoluble agentsBiocompatibleMultiple schemes for microparticle formulationSuccessful adhesion in wet tissue environments(A) Extracted natural teeth are used for proof of concept.

University of Pennsylvania,Active Nematic Colloids For Microrobotics And Materials Assembly,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/55597,"A material mixture (active colloids immersed in nematic liquid crystals) that act as microrobots for directed assembly and micromanipulation of passive colloidal particles.Problem:Colloids interact with areas of distortion, such as with walls or with defects in the environment such as sharp edges and can become trapped along disclination lines in passive systems. These strong interactions mean that once colloids are assembled, they can only be dis-assembled by going into the isotropic state to eliminate the elastic interactions, and thus cannot be deliberately positioned at a particular location in the domain. Thus, it is difficult for passive colloidal particles to undergo directed assembly or micromanipulation.Solution:Development of active colloids as microrobots for dynamic manipulation of passive colloids. The microrobots: (I) Can have shapes designed to promote lock and key interactions. (II) Can also have anchoring conditions designed to form disclination lines attached to the active colloid.Technology:For lock and key microrobotics, the authors designed a multi-armed magnetic microrobot with companion defect to manipulate passive nematic colloid. This microrobot has a companion dipolar defect on one of its arms aligned with the far-field director field and can interact with passive colloids in nematic liquid crystals. The authors deliberately use disclination lines as a tool for robotic assembly and motion and attach them to mobile colloids in nematic liquid crystals. When the colloids move under an external field, the disclinations elongate with complex dynamics, thus driving motion in active colloids and subsequent interactions with passive colloids.Advantages:Multi-armed microrobot can micromanipulate passive colloidsMicrorobot can interact with colloids in Saturn ring or dipolar defect configurationCan assemble in multiple configurations (i.e. passive colloids with dipolar defects assemble in 3 different configurations)Microscopic images of multi‐armed microrobot.

University of Pennsylvania,High-Speed Computational Architecture For Reduced Latency In Big Data Processing,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54113,"Novel computational architecture designs to reduce the latency time to process large volumes of data utilizing the reconfiguration of memory and storage; streamlining read/write functions to include computational logic within the register file; and programmable schedule and memory utilization within a configurable load/store unit.Problem:The execution of big data applications used by search engines, natural language processing or classification algorithms is energy intensive and requires high throughput sorting and processing of data. Part of the inefficiency arises from:fixed data access processing between the local storage and memory and cloud storage.a conventional register file retrieves (“reads”) data for a processing operation by another component, then stores (“writes”) the processed data back into the register file.current load/store units allow no control over or optimized organization of scheduling or which memory registers are utilized or not utilized. Memory organization can become a limitation when processing large volumes of data.Solution:Reconfigurable architecture of memory and storage in a computer to offload functions away from the central and intelligence processing units. This allows direct access to both local and remote memory, with high bandwidth and low latency.A computational register file that reduces the latency time by combining the “write” and operation steps described above. Therefore, the computational register file can operate on the content during read/write, instead of performing them separately.A configurable load-store unit to reduce latency of data access by applying different scheduling and utilization policies for different load/store instructions. The programmer has direct control over the memory scheduling and utilization.Technology:To reconfigure memory and storage, logically disaggregated interconnections (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) switches) allow the field-programmable gate array to access both local and remote memory. The memory network serves local and remote requests using a point-to-point connection instead of the switch-based network to reduce latency.To perform operations within a computational register file, the operand name is expanded from RX to RX.Y, where X is the name of the register and Y is the port ID of the register. The name of register X selects which register in the register file to be used and port ID Y selects which computational logic to be used. Using this architecture, an operation only requires one load instruction to be performed.Each new load/store unit has its ID and respective attributes stored in a configuration table. The programmer uses the table to improve the scheduling and utilization to define the size of a single memory request, the coalescing threshold, the coalescing window, and its scheduling priority.Advantages:Reconfiguration of Memory and Storage:Fifteen microsecond latency for data access, one hundred times lower than CPU-based systems160 GB/s bandwidth, eight times higher than conventional CPU serversEnables adaptation to accommodate different index algorithm schemes and different index sizesComputational Register File:Given a photo document dataset, processes indexes with four times fewer nodes at sixty-eight times lower latency compared to CPU only; andHandles multiple types of data, including text, images, and videos.Reconfigurable and Programmable Load/Store Unit:Improved latency of big data applications by four timesBetter tradeoff between memory access latency and bandwidth by allowing control of memory schedulingFig. 1: The system architecture connects the Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) to a storage and memory pool through a set of interconnections.

University of Pennsylvania,New Paradigm of Using Hypoxia-Promoting Therapeutics for Enhancing Bone Fracture Repair,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/55495,"Modulate oxygen-releasing erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) to promote low oxygen conditions (hypoxia) and enhance bone fracture repair.Problem:Bone fracture repair (or healing) is a complex regenerative process aimed at restoring damaged bone to its pre-injury state. About 5% to 10% of all fractures experience delayed or failed healing during this process. Previous studies have suggested that the initial phase of the repair process is characterized by a pronounced oxygen insufficiency (low oxygen condition, or hypoxia), attributed to the disruption of blood vessels. However, due to methodological limitations, the oxygenation activities in the fracture gap remain poorly understood.Solution:The inventors employed different methods to study tissue oxygenation in the fracture gap. They observed high oxygen concentrations that may impede repair in the local area days after the fracture. To address this, the inventors showed that targeting erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) and local hemoglobin concentrations promotes hypoxic conditions, thereby enhancing fracture repair.Technology:The inventors designed a novel device to guide the recruitment, enrichment, and differentiation of EPCs, with the additional capability of modulating the function of these cells to influence the oxygen environment in the surrounding tissue. The device consists of a scaffold that incorporates or is coated with two bioactive compositions, providing a versatile platform for potential therapeutic applications in the field of regenerative medicine.Advantages:Modulation of EPCs significantly reduced tissue oxygen, promoted hypoxia, and enhanced fracture repair in the fracture gap (demonstrated by significantly increased osteoprogenitor activation, angiogenesis, and bone formation).A potential avenue for exploring new therapeutic approaches for fracture healing.Elucidated a previously understudied phenomenon of oxygen levels underlying fracture healing.Stage of Development:Proof of ConceptIntellectual Property:Provisional FiledReference Media:Lang, A et al.Nat Comm Biol, 2024 Mar 13;  7(1): 315.Lang, A et al.Bone 2022 Jan; 154: 116247.Lang, A et al.Acta Biomater 2019 Mar 1; 86: 171.McDermottAM et al.Sci Transl Med, 2019 Jun 5; 11(495): eaav7756.Herberg, S et al.Sci Adv 2019 Aug 28; 5(8): eaax2476.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:24-10587-TpNCSWeb Published:11/4/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/55495"
University of Pennsylvania,The First Curative Treatment of Phenylketonuria Using Genetic Engineering Approaches,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/55469,"The base editing of phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme in the liver to restore phenylalanine metabolism and prevent neurotoxic effects.Problem:Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a severe disorder affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 U.S. newborns. PKU is marked by a genetic mutation in the phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme (PAH), resulting in phenylalanine (Phe) buildup. Early detection and management through strict dietary Phe restriction can prevent severe intellectual disability. Additional treatments include large neutral amino acids and glycomacropeptide supplementation, though with limited success. Finally, there are the FDA-approved adjuvant treatment for PKU, sapropterin dihydrochloride, and the enzyme substitution therapy pegvaliase, which also have limited efficacy. Owing to the restricted therapeutic modalities for PKU, novel approaches are required to fill this unmet need.Solution:This invention offers a genetic engineering approach to restore PAH function through the base editing of mutant PAH that enables sustained production of functional PAH capable of restoring Phe metabolism.Technology:This invention corrects one of the most common PAH variants in PKU (P281L) through corrective adenine base editing (ABE) of mutated PAH. Although the primary toxicity is in the brain, the PAH gene is largely expressed in the liver from hepatocytes presenting them as the primary therapeutic target. With the delivery of ABE8.8 mRNA and the P281L guide RNAs in vivo using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in humanized PKU mice, a complete and durable normalization of blood Phe levels occurs within 48 h of treatment, resulting from corrective PAH editing in the liver.Advantages:First-in-class curative strategy for PKU.First genetic engineering approach in PAH.LNPs can be used to deliver base editors in vivo, which naturally hone to the liver in vivo.Alternative strategies include AAV delivery.Improved on-target editing in humanized PKU mice with PAH1 hybrid guide RNAs.

University of Pennsylvania,Lipid Nanoparticles That Specifically Target The Lungs,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/55381,"Lung-targeting lipid nanoparticles allowing organ specific mRNA delivery for gene therapy applications.Problem:Gene therapy via mRNA delivery allows the rapid generation of therapeutics and vaccines for a wide range of applications. However, mRNA is especially vulnerable to degradation in the body, necessitating packaging within lipid nanoparticles. While these lipid nanoparticles protect mRNA and facilitate delivery, to date they act in a non-specific manner, entering cells regardless of therapeutic relevance.Solution:This library of lipids allows the production of lipid nanoparticles that specifically target the lungs. This allows lung-specific targeting of mRNA gene therapy, increasing the efficiency of gene delivery and improving therapeutic efficacy. Further, these lipid nanoparticles are readily biodegradable, ensuring they can be cleared from the body after delivering their mRNA payload.Technology:To identify lipid nanoparticles that exhibit organ-specific targeting, the inventors combined lipid materials to produce a total of 180 different lipid nanoparticle formulations. Using barcoded mRNA and genetic sequencing, the inventors were able to follow these lipid nanoparticles through the body and identify what lipids resulted in increased barcode distribution into the lungs.

University of Pennsylvania,Space Shuttle-Inspired Branched Lipid Nanoparticles As Potent mRNA Transporters,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/55691,"Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with reversibly attached branched lipid tails for the delivery of mRNA for gene therapy.Problem:Delivery of mRNA to target cells enables the expression of engineered proteins but mRNA is unstable and negatively charged, necessitating a delivery vehicle to ensure its entry into cells. LNPs can ferry mRNA across the cell membrane, but their key component - lipidoid - can be difficult to synthesize, and their efficacy in delivering mRNA is variable. LNPs with degradable alkyl branched tails have been found to improve cell penetration, but these lipids are difficult to synthesize due to a lack of commercially available branched building blocks.Solution:A combinatorial method for one-pot, high-throughput, and cost-effective production of a wide variety of lipidoids with variable headgroups, body tails, and branch tails. Using this method, they create a lipidoid with “space-shuttle resembling” branched alkyl tails with degradable linkers. These tails dramatically improve mRNA delivery by enhancing endosomal escape, increasing the mRNA delivered to the cell's translation machinery. The addition of these tails to inefficacious lipidoids can increase mRNA delivery by up to three orders of magnitude. This greatly improves therapeutic protein expression. Nanoparticles created with these lipidoids would, therefore, improve outcomes for several gene therapy applications, including vaccines and cancer therapeutics.Technology:This method can be used to rapidly synthesize branched lipidoids for the construction of LNPs. LNPs sequester negatively charged mRNA and facilitate entry into the cell via their neutral charge and hydrophobic alkyl tails. The escape of the LNPs from the cell to deliver mRNA to translation machinery is facilitated by branched tails that can then detach to promote mRNA delivery, like booster rockets detaching from a space shuttle. Using a one-pot, two-step, three-component reaction, the inventors synthesized a library of lipidoids with branched tails connected via a degradable linker. This synthetic strategy is highly efficient, producing over 80% yield, with easily removable dichloromethane or triethylamine solvents, and with byproducts easily quenched with ethanol.Advantages:Degradable linkers connecting branched alkyl tails enhances endosomal escape to improve transfection efficiencyFive-fold greater therapeutic protein expression of FGF-21 compared to industry standardRapid, cost-efficient, and high-throughput synthesis schemeRuleset for structural criteria governing lipidoid potency(A) Depiction of space shuttle-inspired strategy to enhance lipid nanoparticle mRNA delivery via the addition of branched tails with degradable linkers.

University of Pennsylvania,An Improved and Targeted Approach to Genetic Screening for Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma in African Ancestry Population,22-10097,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/55357,"A method for more targeted pre-screening for Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG) in individuals of African ancestry.Problem:POAG, the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, currently affects 44 million individuals globally and is expected to impact 80 million people by the year 2040. Of particular concern is its disproportionate burden on individuals of African ancestry, who experience a fivefold higher prevalence than European Americans and are up to 15 times more likely to suffer from vision loss due to this condition. Despite its considerable impact, the genetic basis of POAG in African ancestry populations remains largely understudied.POAG is often called the “silent thief of sight” because it is asymptomatic in early stages. It is estimated that approximately 50% of individuals with POAG are unaware that they have the disease. Early detection and intervention are essential because vision loss from POAG is irreversible. Treatments for POAG, though imperfect, can help to slow or halt disease progression in many patients.There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic methods for identifying subjects of African ancestry at risk for this blinding disease. Because POAG is familial with a strong genetic component, screening by genetic testing is a viable option. Recent studies suggest that polygenic risk scores (PRS) may have clinical utility in POAG prediction and classification, but almost all PRS have been generated from variants identified in populations of European or Asian ancestry, with diminishing predictive value in African ancestry individuals.Solution:A genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted by the inventors unveiled novel genetic risk factors associated with POAG, in addition to confirming known risk factors. These findings open new avenues for understanding the genetic complexities of POAG among African ancestry populations and offer potential targets for future diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. The inventors also developed a polygenic risk score for POAG in African ancestry individuals that can identify the patients at highest risk for the disease.Technology:The inventors conducted a GWAS where they utilized advanced genotyping and sequencing technologies to comprehensively analyze the genomes of 11,275 individuals of African ancestry. They detected 46 risk loci associated with POAG at genome-wide significance. Further functional and in silico analysis were conducted to validate the findings, identifying three likely causal variants for POAG. For individuals of African ancestry, a PRS for POAG (African ancestry individuals) outperformed a PRS from summary statistics of a much larger GWAS derived from European ancestry individuals.Advantages:A total of 46  risk loci found in significant association with POAG in individuals of African ancestry.The large sample size allowed maximal statistical power for improved risk loci identification in African ancestry individuals.A significant addition to the previous POAG GWAS that predominantly contained European or Asian ancestry individuals.Improves targeted screening and therapeutic intervention for POAG in African ancestry individuals.Quantification of the genetic architecture similarities and differences between African and non-African populations for this blinding disease.PRS derived from our African ancestry population outperformed much larger PRS from European ancestry population when tested in African datasets, showing its clinical utility to this ancestry group.Performance of PRS generated from summary statistics from GBMI (European individuals) and the discovery mega-analysis (African individuals) in independent datasets of African ancestry individuals. Summary statistics from GBMI (European individuals) and discovery mega-analysis (African individuals) were each used to create a PRS. Each PRS was measured in three independent datasets of African ancestry individuals (eMERGE, GGLAD-2, PMBB). Fig. 6A: The Nagelkerke R2 is shown on the x-axis and the test datasets are shown on the y-axis, with the P-value corresponding to the Nagelkerke p-value.

University of Pennsylvania,"Contactless, Reversible Material Deposition From Liquid Droplets To Solid Surfaces",,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/55282,"A microfluidic device allowing spatiotemporal manipulation of droplets that can be applied to high-resolution analytical techniques.Problem:Electrowetting methods such as electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) have been developed to support high-resolution analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry and atomic force microscopy. EWOD allows processing of liquid droplets on solid surfaces or within a thin space. However, the applicability of EWOD is limited by the contact between the droplet and the electrode, which limits droplet size. While other contactless wetting technologies have been developed, they perform poorly in modifying contact angle of the droplet. In addition, microfluidic devices that allow recovery of deposited materials from solid surfaces can benefit subsequent analysis or tagging of individual droplets.Solution:The inventors developed a contactless method to induce reversible droplet wetting and dewetting on chemically inert substrates, employing the technology of discharge-based dielectric charge injection (DCI). This method allows larger droplet size without sacrificing the ability to modify contact angle of the droplet.Technology:DCI uses a sharp conductive probe placed above the droplet that induces dielectric breakdown of the surrounding dielectric medium (e.g., air or oil), leading to corona discharge, a phenomenon where the dielectric ionizes and injects charges onto the substrate surface. The substrate surface in DCI shares a similar design to that of EWOD, where a thin dielectric film is deposited above an electrode. The system demonstrates voltage-dependent contact angle saturation, with a prototype reaching the lowest contact angle of about 20°. As a reversible system, complete dewetting is achieved by turning off the power source, which leads to charge dissipation.Advantages:Simple designContactless, allowing flexibility in droplet sizeReversible, allowing material deposition and recoverySmall contact angle that is competitive with traditional EWODSpatiotemporally controlledFluorescent images of the four corners of the droplet wetting area on the substrate surface after droplet removal and drying, demonstrating successful deposition of material by dielectric charge injection (DCI)-facilitated electrowetting.

However, existing LNP-based delivery systems have intrinsic high immunogenicity, restricting the mRNA therapeutics' protein expression levels, durability, and broader applications (e.g., redosing).Solution:The inventors constructed a series of Mannich reaction-based combinatorial libraries and used high throughput in vitro and in vivo screenings to identify the top-performing ionizable lipid, C-a16. This antioxidant lipid effectively reduces cellular inflammatory responses, extends intracellular protein expression duration, and mitigates intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), a pro-inflammatory signal induced by LNP-mRNA treatment.Technology:The inventors designed six combinatorial libraries utilizing Mannich reactions between (1) amines, (2) formaldehyde, and (3) various compounds such as phenols, thiols, dialkyl ketones, pyrroles, and benzophenones. This approach established a comprehensive screen comprising structurally diverse ionizable lipids (310 in vitro and 11 in vivo). They identified the strongest candidate, C-a16 lipid, and compared its expression level, half-life, and immunogenicity with different commercially available ionizable lipids (e.g., MC-3 and SM-102). Then, the team performed further proof-of-concept studies to demonstrate the superiority of the C-a16 LNP in delivering mRNA therapeutics encoding gene editor, tumor neoantigen, and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.Advantages:Use Mannich reactions to establish combinatorial ionizable lipid libraries with higher structure diversity and physicochemical properties.A newly identified ionizable lipid, C-a16, shows improved mRNA delivery and lower immunogenicity than commercially available lipids, such as MC-3, SM-102, and ALC-0315.~5-fold higher luminescence expression intensity compared to MC-3 LNP.~30% increase in the half-life of luciferase in C-a16 LNP-treated mice (53 hours) compared to MC-3 LNP-treated mice (40 hours).C-a16 LNPs contain phenolic tails, which display significantly greater transfection efficiency than other lipids with similar carbon numbers on the tails.Significantly lower expression of oxidative stress-, cell death-, innate immune activation-, RNA- and protein-degradation genes in C-a16 LNP-treated cells.Significantly Lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) in C-a16 LNP-treated Mice than in the MC-3 LNP-treated group.C-a16 LNPs can effectively traffic to the lymph nodes after intramuscular injection.C-a16 LNPs co-delivering Cas9 mRNA and a guide RNA for transthyretin (TTR) genome editing achieved 5-fold higher TTR gene editing than MC-3 LNP.C-a16 LNPs delivering fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) mRNA led to a 3-fold increase in FGF21 expression in vivo compared to MC-3 LNP.C-a16 LNPs encapsulating tumor neoantigen or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mRNA induced superior antigen-specific immune responses compared to SM102 LNP.Construction of Mannich reaction-based combinatorial libraries for in vitro and in vivo screening of ionizable lipids. a.

Available suppressive medications like steroids, require frequent dosing and are non-specific, resulting in systemic immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to infections. Adoptive cell therapy is a safer and targeted alternative as it utilizes patient-derived cells to achieve immunosuppression and limits extreme side effects such as cytokine release syndrome. Specifically, regulatory T cells (Tregs) have gained attention due to their critical role in immunosuppressive modulation. However, harvesting, purifying, and growing Tregs to therapeutically relevant numbers is challenging.Solution:The inventors identified a proprietary ionizable lipid (C14-A1) and subsequent lipid nanoparticle formulation and encapsulated Foxp3 mRNA in the LNP to target and convert primary human CD4+ T cells into Foxp3-positive T (FP3T) cells that function like immunosuppressive Tregs ex-vivo. The FP3T cells have a cytokine profile and suppressive functionality like endogenous Tregs.Technology:From a library of ionizable lipids (an essential component of LNP) including both polyamine cores containing ether linkers (E1-E3) and their analogous structures containing alkyl linkers (A1-A3), the inventors identified C14-A1 as the top-performing lipid with high transfection efficiency and low toxicity. Using microfluidic mixing to formulate LNPs that encapsulate mRNA encoding Foxp3 (a master transcription factor that causes T cells to suppress unwanted effector CD4+/CD8+ cell proliferation by upregulating suppressive cytokine (IL-10 and TGF-β1) secretion), the team delivered the Foxp3 mRNA-LNP formulation to primary human CD4+ T cells to induce Treg-like cells.Advantages:Newly identified ionizable lipid, C14-A1, shows improved mRNA delivery to T cells compared to industry standards, like C12-200.Safe and potent ex-vivo engineering of primary human T cells as immunotherapies for autoimmune disorders (e.g., type 1 diabetes, myasthenia gravis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis).Facilitated greater intracellular mRNA expression, indicated by significant (p< 0.01) 2-3 fold increase in median fluorescence intensity (MFI).Potential application in graft-versus-host disease prevention after organ transplantation surgeries.Potential application in hypersensitivity during allergic reactions.Potential non-viral and in-vivo gene (mRNA) delivery to T cells.Figure 1: Graphical Abstract: Development of a mRNA lipid nanoparticle (mRNA-LNP) platform for immunosuppressive Foxp3-T (FP3T) cell engineering.

However, the modified (pseudouridylated) mRNA used in this platform is optimized for protein production and, consequently, the mRNA itself does not activate innate immune sensors strongly. This diminishes the protective immunity imparted by the vaccine.Solution:LNPs are modular in that lipids may be functionalized to impart different capabilities upon them. Here, the inventors enhance the immunogenicity of the COVID19 LNP-mRNA vaccine by incorporating adjuvant-derived lipidoid into the encapsulating LNP. Delivery of immunostimulatory molecules at the site of antigen production causes a strong innate immune response and greater protective immunity compared to the conventional COVID19 LNP-mRNA vaccine.Technology:The pseudouridylation of mRNA vaccines allows for optimized antigen production, but a muted innate immune response. However, a robust innate immune response is critical to generate protective immunity. Here, the functionalization of LNPs with adjuvant-derived lipidoid stimulates the innate immune response at the site of antigen production. This is accomplished via the ring opening reaction between amine-containing TLR7/8 agonist 1 and C12 epoxide. Adjuvanted LNPs display greater mRNA delivery efficiency compared to conventional LNPs and result in greater protective immunity in a pre-clinical mouse model via several correlates of immunity including dendritic cell activation, T cell responses, and humoral responses.Advantages:Enhanced mRNA delivery and innate immunogenicityAdjuvant-derived lipidoid delivered precisely at the site of antigen productionEasily implemented into the current manufacturing pipelineImproved protective immunity without alteration to the antigen (here, the Spike protein)Figure 1.

However, limitations remain in its adoption and scalability. Many existing 3D printers have multiple nozzles that require the swapping in and out of filament material during material processing. The trending slicing software lacks the ability to incorporate differentiated material information and merge it into machine instruction programs, and the material transition process critical for producing high quality prints has received little investigation. These limitations result in downtime and inconsistent material parameters.Solution:An integrated single-nozzle multi-filament (SNMF) system with hardware, software and firmware design eliminates the need for material swap-out during printing and allows for controlled gradient compositions and transitions.Technology:The SNMF printing system, rooted in the fused deposition modeling (FDM) technique, consists of three primary components: a single 4-in-1-out (four input chambers that merge at the center and subsequently connect to one output chamber) nozzle for depositing material, an auger embedded in the nozzle for extruding and blending materials, and a set of stepper motors for feeding different materials.

One promising solution is carbon capture and storage within the concrete, with extensive research on mixing processes, carbonation curing of cast concrete, and recycling waste aggregates. However, some challenges remain unaddressed, including relatively slow carbonation kinetics and difficulties ensuring uniform carbonation in large or thick concrete structures. To achieve net-zero carbon emission goal, simply by absorbing CO2 in concrete is not enough.Solution:This invention is a 3D-printable concrete formulation derived from naturally abundant materials. It incorporates hierarchical porous biominerals, which significantly reduce mineral waste, carbon footprint, and enhance the concrete's carbon absorption and storage capacity.Technology:Supplementary cementing materials (SCMs) can reduce the use of cement while providing carbon capture and storage capabilities. The inventors replace up to 50 wt.% of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) with a natural SCM, diatomaceous earth (DE), which improves the material’s printability and the structural integrity of the prints.

The negative charge of DE can bind calcium ions and form calcium carbonate, further strengthening the concrete and enabling continuous carbon capture and storage.Advantages:Reducing greenhouse gas emissionsThe porosity of diatomaceous earth offers the concrete formulation with buildability, 3D printability, and strength mandated for conventional concreteThe concrete formulation replaces up to 50 wt.% of ordinary Portland cement with DE, contributing to reduced material waste and improved sustainabilityStable stacking of up to 111 print layers (200 mm) compared to the version without DE (51 layers, 98.6 mm)The concrete efficiently absorbs 145% more CO2 than concrete without DELeft: Concrete mixture from diatomaceous earth (DE)/Cement = 0.3 weight ratio extruded through 2 mm nozzle.

University of Pennsylvania,"A Fully Automated, Origami-Inspired Approach for Manufacturing Self-Assembling, Self-Reconfiguring, and Reprogrammable Structures.",,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54897,"An origami-based approach to generate complex shapes by folding magnetically programmed sheets.Problem:Shape-changing materials are desirable in applications such as soft robotics, implantable and wearable devices, minimally invasive medicine, and micromachines. Common control signals used for self-folding, such as temperature, diffusion, and capillary forces, often require long wait times for the signal to dissipate, making repeated folding and unfolding challenging. Faster methods using chemical, electrochemical, or light signals are difficult to reprogram into different structures. Systems using active computation and directed actuation for folding control can generate different shapes over multiple folding steps, enabling the formation of different 3D shapes from the same material. However, these systems are not scalable.Solution:Magnetic actuation offers a simple option for fast, reprogrammable shape change simply by applying an external magnetic field to a precisely-oriented magnetized sample.Technology:The Sung Lab developed a fully automated approach for manufacturing self-assembling, self-reconfiguring, and reprogrammable structures. Like the magnetic writing commonly used in hard disk drive perpendicular recording, this approach uses a magnetic write head that programs a thin magnetic sheet with North or South signals at the pixel level. Previous magnetic folding systems (for example, direct ink, lithography-based, bottom-up assembly-based) relied on fabricating the fold pattern directly into the sheet, making the reconfiguration difficult without human input. However, the system presented here is fully automated after inserting the programmable sheet.Advantages:The system provides distinct advantages compared to existing magnetic folding approaches in its ability to accommodate any flat-foldable pattern.The system enables simultaneous programming and mass production of custom-folded structures.The obtained structures are recyclable and reprogrammable.Adding different components (such as electronics for control, sensing, or feedback) to the programmable sheets is possible.Foldable electronic display.

University of Pennsylvania,"An Adaptive, Language-Agnostic, and Generalizable Method to Determine the Hearing Level and Speech Perception Abilities of a Patient",23-10476,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54884,"This hearing test is tuned to a patient’s hearing level and changes based on performance to accurately diagnose hearing abilityProblem:Currently, no single hearing evaluation can determine multiple facets of an individual’s hearing ability. For example, some tests may determine hearing awareness at specific frequencies, but gather no data regarding speech understanding. Others may test understanding, but are limited to specific languages and, thus, are not generalizable. Furthermore, previous attempts to assess linguistic understanding at various levels of background noise levels suffer from the inability to compare different tests and different levels making changes after intervention difficult to track.Solution:This hearing test involves testing the components of speech and language at different levels of loudness and background noise. Furthermore, this test is language agnostic and, therefore, can be administered to a broad patient population. The testing is performed in an adaptive manner so that a wide range of abilities can be incorporated into a single testing paradigm.Technology:A method whereby the hearing level and speech perception abilities of a patient is determined. Test stimuli are provided to the patient and the patient is presented with three stimuli, from which they must identify one stimulus that is different from the other two. The patient must choose between the three (forced choice, in an “odd one out” paradigm) in order for the test to progress. Whether the patient makes the correct choice determines the course of the test via an adaptive algorithm that tailors subsequent stimuli to target the patient’s hearing ability. The test stimuli will be comprised of the sounds that make up portions of words and form the building blocks of language.Advantages:The test is presented at a loudness determined to be adequate for that person’s hearing level, without background noise, and to either (or both) ears.The ability is scored on multiple domains based on a validated set of scores from people of all hearing abilities.This test is language-agnostic and, therefore, can be applied broadly to diverse patient populations.Stage of Development:Proof of ConceptDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:23-10476-TpNCSWeb Published:8/12/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54884"
University of Pennsylvania,SCALPEL or Secure Compartments Automatically Learned and Protected by Execution Using Lightweight Metadata,Docket # 21-9625,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54813,"SCALPEL is a lightweight optimization tool for automatically compartmentalizing policies for hardware-accelerated enforcement in a tagged architecture. The tool also creates a layer or protection (or hardening) by learning and allowing certain privileges based on learned expectations.Problem:The languages of operating systems, device drivers and embedded applications are large and unwieldy at times – resulting in unsafe and exploitable systems. Privilege separation separates a system into components, each limited to the privileges it requires to operate. Privilege separation relies on coarse-grained, process-level separation, where the virtual memory system provides isolation. Although isolating vulnerability in one component from other system components makes the system more robust to attackers, this approach often negatively affects system performance.Solution:Research from Andre DeHon’s lab at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a flexible, tag-based hardware security monitor that provides an opportunity to enforce fine-grained, hardware-accelerated privilege separation which can optimize system performance while decreasing opportunities for system exploitation.Technology:SCALPEL enables rapid self-learning of low-level privileges and the automatic creation and implementation of compartmentalization security policies for a tagged architecture. Researchers from the DeHon Lab used this tool for a hardware-accelerated security monitoring design called the PIPE (Processor Interlocks for Policy Enforcement) architecture. On the back-end,SCALPEL is a tool that automatically lowers compartmentalization policies to the PIPE for hardware-accelerated enforcement. On the front end, SCALPEL provides an optimization opportunity through a set of compartment generation algorithms to help security engineers explore the privilege-performance tradeoff space that a runtime environment can achieve.SCALPEL enables fine-grained privilege separation with hundreds of compartments to achieve a low over-privilege ratio with low overheads.Advantages:SCALPEL created policies can reduce over-privilege by orders of magnitude with hundreds of logical compartments while imposing low overheads (<5%).In cases where human expertise is available for additional fine-tuning, SCALPEL easily integrates human-supplied knowledge in its policy exploration.SCALPEL automatically implements compartmentalization strategies across the privilege-performance tradeoff space, all without manual tagging or code restructuring.Stage of Development:Proof of ConceptIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Roessler, N. and Dehon, A;ACM J Emerg Technol Comput Syst, 2021 Sept; 18(1): 1.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:21-9625-TpNCSWeb Published:8/2/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54813"

However, current dyes often present similar uptake in tumors as normal tissue and do not improve recognition of tumor margins.Solution:Biocompatible and biodegradable micelles loaded with the visually detectable Zinc Phthalocyanine (ZnPC) dye are generated to enable selective delivery into tumors with minimal uptake in normal tissue. Upon injection, the ZnPC-loaded micelles clearly demarcate tumor margins in the colon and small intestine tissues.Technology:The inventors use micelles composed of diblock copolymer poly(ethylene glycol)-co-poly(caprolactone) (PEG-PCL) to effectively encapsulate various hydrophobic derivatives of the blue dye, ZnPC. The formed nanoparticles selectively deliver ZnPC into tumors either via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect or through modulation of the micelle surface with tissues targeting ligands.

Current techniques for recovering unique molecules or cells from droplet microfluidic device studies are complex and cumbersome, not allowing for monitoring or diagnosis of multiple conditions. Manipulation of individual droplets is extremely important as it enables multiplexed high dimensional phenotyping of the targets, going beyond surface phenotyping.Solution:This technology is an optically transparent, photoresponsive polymer layer within existing droplet microfluidic devices allows for monitoring of real time events and recovery of unique analytes or cells for further analysis.Technology:A static microdoplet array that utilizes U-shaped traps to arbitrarily capture flowing droplets while the exhaust channels ensure single droplet capture and retention and serve as release channels for recovery of the captured droplets.

University of Pennsylvania,"Scalable, Low Voltage Device For Liquid Crystal-Based Technologies",,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54792,"A multi-stable liquid crystal (LC) device based on saddle-spray director variation that enables fast optoelectronic switching and has low power requirements.Problem:LC devices are crucial for a number of modern technologies including monitors, electronic switches, and storage devices. These devices rely on an optoelectrical process by which applied current induces changes in the intrinsic molecular orientation of an LC. However, currently available devices are limited by complex fabrication processes, high threshold voltage requirements and slow switching speeds.Solution:The current invention addresses this problem by providing a fast, multi-stable LC device with low threshold voltage requirements, showing a threshold switching electric field of 0.5V/mm. The device consists of annular ring-based arrays plated on copper electrodes which are easily manipulated by applying current across the device. Unique to this invention is the utilization of saddle-splay effects, which are routinely suppressed in other LC systems. Therefore, generic, achiral liquid crystals exhibit spontaneously broken surface symmetries, leading to emergence of chiral and polar arrangements that can couple to directional DC fields and be extended across the domains. Thus, this technology opens new avenues for the development of more advanced, higher efficiency LC based technologies.Technology:The technology takes advantage of “saddle-splay” elasticity in LCs. Using combinations of lithographic patterning and selective surface functionalization, surface patterns are created with spatially defined geometry and precisely controlled surface chemistry. Broken symmetry regimes are defined, and the desired patterning geometry results in a multi-state stable LC display device that can be switched at an extremely low voltage density.Advantages:The threshold switching electric field of 0.5V/mm demonstrates the low switching fieldHas a low threshold voltage resulting in low power requirementsThe fabrication process is simple and easily scalable, and compatible with the conventional photolithography processSaddle-splay technology enables switching between eight states compared to just four with traditional LC systemsDemonstration of a multistable LC switching device from a patterned square array of annuli. a) Schematic of the device setup with top and bottom copper electrodes patterned on glass slides. b—e) A set of stable, cardinal states that can be switched upon the application of a small (0.5 V/μm) transverse, directional electric field as indicated by the yellow arrow.

University of Pennsylvania,"Biocompatible, Reversible, and Strong Multilayered Tape for Advanced Wound Care",24-10524,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54703,"A hydrogel-based adhesive with a hydrophobic backing layer protects it from exposure to water and offers painless removal and easy repositioning.Problem:Reversible adhesives have gained popularity in industries with a growing emphasis on reducing waste and improving sustainability. Previously, the inventors have developed a strong and reversible adhesive film from poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and boric acid (BA) for wound care. However, when water in the adhesive completely evaporates, the film becomes dry and stiff, resulting in a skin-stretching sensation. Additionally, continuous exposure to water could degrade the performance and ultimately dissolve the adhesive.Solution:To overcome this limitation, a biocompatible waterproof backing is added to protect the PVA/BA adhesive layer and wound site from continuous exposure to water, thus preventing the film from being dissolved. Moreover, the backing layer could provide a strong contract force that closes wounds while keeping moisture around the skin from evaporating. The film remains soft and flexible, improving patient comfort and healing. Additional water absorbing sealant and water proofing materials could be added at the edge of the adhesive to further improve the sealing.Technology:The tape comprises two layers. The adhesive layer has three components: instant adhesives consisting of water absorbing elastic hydrogel together with a water-activated instant sealant layer (PVA/BA), and a waterproof layer. Upon activation by water or moisture, this layer forms an immediate bond with the substrate. The hydrophobic backing layer contains silicone, an air-permeable and thermal-insulating material that protects adhesive layers from external moisture and other environmental factors. It imparts additional mechanical support to the adhesive, ensuring the tape remains adhered to the skin or the wound site during extended use. Combining both layers offers a higher adhesion strength than the current topical wound dressing products while offering additional protection to the wound dressing and wound site.Advantages:Biocompatible and ReversibleInstant adhesion to a wide range of substrates, including plastics, fabrics, glass, metals, ceramics, and skinAesthetically versatile (transparent or colored), allowing for customization and personalized usageProvides additional applications such as drug delivery, monitoring, and simulationAllows for industrial-scale productionSchematic illustrations of PVA/BA adhesives.

Despite their high biosafety, low toxicity, and immunogenicity, their drawbacks involve the need for microfluidic or T-tube technology for assembly and low temperature for long-term storage (−70 °C). Additionally, four component LNPs have shown a low transfection efficiency (1-2%).Solution:To eliminate the weaknesses of LNPs, the inventors developed a library of one-component compounds designed with precise placement of the IAJD’s functional groups. The mRNA encapsulation step is fast and simple, allowing rapid screening of the properties of each new IAJD and uncovering molecular design principles for targeted delivery.Technology:The one-component IAJDs in this library can be synthesized in just three steps. Each is made using symmetrically trialkylated pentaerythritol (PE) in the hydrophobic domain and four different piperazine-based ionizable amines in the hydrophilic part. These IAJDs coalesce with mRNA to form vesicles of predictable sizes, namely dendrimersome nanoparticles (DNPs). This process is achieved through a straightforward injection into an acetate buffer. After conducting in vivo screening, highly effective IAJDs were identified, specifically targeting the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes. One primarily targets the spleen and liver, while six exhibit equal distribution to the spleen, liver, lung, and lymph nodes.Advantages:The first system to demonstrate delivery of mRNA to multiple organs (lung, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes).One-component IAJDs can be fabricated in as few as three steps.Design changes in the IAJD, such as a decrease in alkyl length, have been shown to increase mRNA transfection.IAJDs exhibit higher stability than 4-component LNPs due to symmetric achiral architecture.Concepts of four-component LNPs (a), one-component IAJD-based DNPs (b), three-step synthesis of PE-based IAJDs (c), and the mechanism of cell transfection of DNPs encapsulating Luc-mRNA (d).

These multi-step methods are labor intensive and have limited spatial resolution. Additionally, the scalability of these processes is not feasible, as each device must be patterned individually. These processes are additive and generate surfaces that are not flat, limiting the available topographies of these microfluidic devices.Solution:A technique that patterns a mold, which then transfers its wettability properties to the microfluidic device, allowing for single-step generation of hydrophobic/hydrophilic regions. The mold is reusable, allowing for mass-production of microfluidic channels. This process is less time-consuming and labor-intensive compared to traditional wettability patterning, and is not additive, so smooth surfaces can be generated.Technology:This method allows selective hydrophobic perfluoropolyether (PFPE) enrichment in regions, rather than uniform distribution, by patterning a silica mold substrate with hydrophobic silane-treated regions. The wettability of the mold is then transferred to the network surface as areas adjacent to the silane-treated regions become PFPE-enriched and thus hydrophobic, while the unenriched regions remain relatively hydrophilic. The polymer network is then cured with UV light, peeled off the mold, and dried to form the channel.Advantages:Single-step definition of hydrophobic/hydrophilic regions allows for faster fabrication of microfluidic devices compared to multi-step treatment with individual hydrophobic/hydrophilic components.The method is compatible with traditional soft lithography techniques.The use of a reusable mold that transfers wettability allows for faster fabrication and more facile scalability, as each device does not need to be individually patterned.The resulting microfluidic devices are solvent resistant.The process is non-additive, allowing for generation of smooth surfaces, which is not possible for traditional wettability patterning.Micrometer-level spatial resolution compares favorably to the resolution afforded by multi-step techniques.(A) Scheme for generating and curing hydrophilic/hydrophobic networks with silanized patterning used to dictate wettability.

Compared to traditional bulk mixing and batch process approaches, microfluidic technology for mRNA-LNP manufacturing enables precision synthesis via rapid mixing and fluid flow control. However, fouling and clogging in microfluidic channels pose significant problems for LNP formulation as numerous existing hydrophilic/hydrophobic coatings only inhibit biomolecule adsorption and fouling in aqueous solutions, while the condition for LNP formation is a mixture of hydrophilic aqueous and amphiphilic ethanol (EtOH) solvents.Solution:Coating a silicon (Si)/glass-based microfluidic mixing device with omniphobic, thin-layer perfluorocarbon (TLP) improves chemical resistance, suppresses non-specific biomolecule adsorption, and prevents nanoparticle aggregation.Technology:The TLP layer consists of an immobilized tethered perfluorocarbon (TP) overlaid by a thin liquid perfluorocarbon (LP) layer, which is an FDA-approved material. Application of TLP coating to a Si/glass microfluidic mixing device repels water, EtOH, and water/EtOH mixture while suppressing non-specific adsorption of biomolecules such as BSA, glycine, and mRNA-LNP constituents.

This disease can be fatal within the first few months of life and increases the risk of liver cancer. The current treatment involves a strict drug regimen and dietary restrictions. Many people are unable to maintain this regimen and require a liver transplant. Therefore, patients need a lasting cure for HT1.Solution:Inventors developed a gene-editing method to restore tyrosine processing and cure HT1. The cure can be administered to patients with HT1 or to a fetus before birth. This method targets a non-mutated gene, making it universal for all patients regardless of their specific causal mutation. Additionally, the gene-editing method is highly specific to the target gene and the liver, minimizing off-target effects.Technology:The inventors developed a gene-editing strategy to inhibit the function of 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD) that acts upstream of the HT1-mutated enzyme (FAH). This loss of HPD function shunts the tyrosine byproducts to an alternative pathway. Specifically, the inventors used an adenine-base editor and guide RNA that targets a splice site in HPD. They packaged the editor and guide RNA in lipid nanoparticles to enhance delivery to the liver. These lipid nanoparticles can be injected by a one-time IV infusion.Advantages:One-time durable cure eliminates the need for lifelong drug treatment and dietary restrictions.Lipid-nanoparticle delivery increases on-target delivery to the liver (60-70% of alleles edited) rather than off-target organs (0-1.5% edited).Adenine base editing of a splice site has high on-target efficiency and low off-target editing: 60-70% of target alleles were edited, while none of the top 100 predicted off-target sites were edited.Stage of Development:Target IdentifiedPreclinical DiscoveryIND Enabling StudiesIntellectual Property:PCT filedDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:23-10295-TpNCSWeb Published:7/10/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54597"

Thioflavin-T (ThT) is a widely used dye for staining amyloid fibrils because its binding to amyloid fibrils increases its fluorescence intensity. However, ThT has a relatively small Stokes shift (50 nm), which is problematic when combined with other spectrally similar molecules. It also has poor selectivity for fibrils over other aggregates, and poor cellular uptake.Solution:Bimane-based fluorescent probes that exhibit turn-on fluorescence in the presence of AD/PD biomarkers with good cellular uptake and without binding to other fibrils, allowing for early, facile, rapid detection of AD/PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.Technology:A synthetic route that enables rapid access to fluorescent probes from bimane chromophores, which show good fluorescent turn-on and selectivity among fibril types. The current probes can detect amplified fibrils (AFs) from patient tissues, while the previous method, ThT, cannot detect them effectively. In addition, the probes have large Stokes shifts in the presence of pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) and low background fluorescence in cell lysate, making them a potential PD/AD biomarker.Advantages:Simple synthetic route allows for easy and potentially scalable synthesisLarge stokes shifts (approx. 200 nm) compare favorably to current dyes used in this approach (approx. 50 nm), giving better signal to noise signalsThe selectivity of these probes is favorable compared to other typical probes, which suffer from lack of selectivity in fibril identity as well as poor cellular uptakeSynthesis of bimane fluorescent probes with tunable emission for the detection of α-synuclein, a known hallmark of Altzeimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.Stage of Development:Proof of ConceptBench PrototypeIntellectual Property:US Patent FiledReference Media:Venkatesh, Y et al.;Chem Sci 2024 Mar 26; (16): 6053.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:23-10337-TpNCSWeb Published:6/27/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54519"
University of Pennsylvania,Deep Learning Model Discovers Antibiotic Drugs in Extinct Organisms Effective Against Drug-Resistant Superbugs,24-10510,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54518,"Antibiotic Peptide de-extinction (APEX) is a deep-learning AI solution that can unearth ancient antibiotics to effectively combat superbugs and tackle antibiotic resistance on a global scale.Problem:Escalating antibiotic resistance around the globe has emerged as one of the pressing problems of our time, with antibiotic-resistant infections causing approximately 1.27 million deaths annually worldwide. Without effective new drugs, this number could surge to 10 million fatalities by 2050. Traditional drug discovery approaches have been unable to keep pace with the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, resulting in a critical shortage of novel antibiotics to combat these resistant pathogens. These developments can seriously jeopardize public health in the future.Solution:Researchers have developed a deep learning AI technology that analyzes a protein database of long-extinct organisms to rediscover lost, never-before-used antibiotic compounds, which display considerable efficacy against pathogens resistant to more traditional antibiotics.Technology:In their experimentation, the researchers employed the Antibiotic Peptide de-extinction (APEX) approach, which relies on deep learning techniques. APEX systematically scanned proteomes of extinct organisms, encompassing various species across different time periods. A multitask deep learning model, trained on both public and in-house peptide sequences from natural and synthetic sources. The peptide sequences generated by APEX range from 8 to 50 residues in length, and predicted antibiotic activity against the most relevant pathogenic strains. Based on predicted antibiotic properties, the highest-ranking peptides underwent extensive in vitro characterization, including assessing antibiotic activity, mechanism of action, secondary structure, synergy, and cytotoxicity.  Testing the selected peptides using in vivo mouse models validated and showcased the peptides’ potential antibacterial effectiveness.Advantages:Automates the process of finding new antibiotic peptides essential to counter antibiotic-resistant pathogens.The deep learning approach allows large databases of ancient proteomes to be mined for relevant molecules.Encrypted peptides discovered reduce bacterial load in a mouse model by 2-3 orders of magnitude.The encrypted peptides operate via new pathways that circumvent the drug resistance of superbugs.Discovered peptides can be used as general antibiotics in non-specialised applications.APEX mines available proteomes of extinct organisms. A multitask deep learning model trained on public and in-house peptide data evaluates amino acid sequences for potential antibiotic activity.

University of Pennsylvania,Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) Mined from Human Gut Metagenome Are Effective Against Antibiotic Resistant Pathogens,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54517,"The collective genomes of the human gut microbiome, known as the metagenome, encode peptides that are effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.Problem:Antimicrobial resistance poses a major threat to public health. The development of drug-resistance outpaces traditional drug discovery approaches. As a result, the supply of drugs available to treat multi-drug resistant microbes, a leading cause of nosocomial infections, is shrinking. There is a need for new antimicrobial drugs and new methods of their discovery for more rapid drug development. Thus far, no significant technological advance has capitalized on this market, which is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.27% through 2030.Solution:The human gut is lined with a diverse population of microbes competing for limited resources. Thus, these microbes have evolved strategies to survive including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which can be leveraged to treat infections in humans. These peptides kill pathogens by puncturing their outer membrane and, importantly, this mechanism of action is less likely to cause antimicrobial resistance.Technology:The inventors mined the human gut metagenome by analyzing publicly available metatranscriptomic data for small open reading frames (smORFs). Candidate AMPs were synthesized and analyzed for membrane permeabilization and depolarization, propensity toward alpha helix formation, and functional antimicrobial activity. The inventors used two separate mouse models of infection to test their candidate AMPs. In the deep thigh infection model, mice were pre-treated with immunosuppressant drugs (cyclophosphamide) immediately preceding infection to simulate nosocomial infection of a deep tissue. The authors identified five lead peptides, of which one has antimicrobial activity comparable to that of polymyxin B (an approved antibiotic).Advantages:Development of resistance toward AMPs, which have non-specific mechanisms of action, is rare.Five lead compounds showed antimicrobial activity that reduced infection by as many as four orders of magnitude, which is comparable to the approved antimicrobial drug polymyxin B.Many of the discovered peptides have antimicrobial activity and synergize with each other.These AMPs modulate commensal bacteria, which may be useful to engineer the gut microbiome.Figure 1. Schematic of the workflow employed to generate lead AMPs and the subsequent screening conducted to confirm their functional efficacy. From bottom left, publicly available metatranscriptomic data was annotated with MetaProdigal to identify smORFs, which were clustered with CD-Hit into 444,054 families. These families were then analyzed further by SmORFinder to generate 4,539 High Confidence Families likely to code for peptides and compared against peptides with purported antimicrobial activity generated by AmPEP to produce 323 high confidence families with predicted antimicrobial activity. 79 were synthesized and screened for bacterial growth inhibition of pathogenic and commensal bacteria and the top candidates subjected to functional membrane permeabilization assays, circular dichroism and structure prediction, and in vivo activity.Stage of Development:Preclinical DiscoveryIntellectual Property:Provisional FiledReference Media:Torres, MDT et al.bioRxiv, 2023 Aug 31 : 555711 (preprint)de la Fuente labX:@delafuenteupennDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:23-10451-TpNCSWeb Published:6/26/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54517"

High-frequency testing can prevent rapid virus spread and reduce COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths, but this can only be realized with accessible, low-cost, and rapid testing. The most widely used tests today (i.e., RT-PCR) are slow, expensive, and require highly skilled workers and designated lab space to collect and interpret the results.Solution:This SARS-CoV-2 biosensor is fabricated on cotton swabs and can be manufactured at low cost. This technology is extremely portable without the need of any heavy equipment for SARS-CoV-2 detection, enabling use at the point-of-care and at home. It also allows SARS-CoV-2 detection within 5 minutes in two simple steps, and the test result can be assessed with naked eye while quantitative results can also be generated using a smartphone camera and a free app.Technology:The COvid-19 Low Cost Optodiagnostic for Rapid Testing (COLOR) consists of a cotton swab whose surface is modified with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the binding receptor for the spike proteins on SARS-CoV-2. To perform the test, the cotton swabs are immersed into nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal samples for one minute, then are soaked in a wine-colored AuNP-cys-ACE2 solution for three minutes. If the sample contains SARS-CoV-2, the interactions between the spike proteins, ACE2 on the cotton swabs, and the gold nanoparticles (AuNP) induce aggregation of AuNP, which subsequently cause the color shift from wine to purple. Detection can occur qualitatively with naked eye or quantitatively through a smartphone camera and a free app.Advantages:Can be manufactured for $0.15 with readily available materialsAllows detection of SARS-CoV-2 within 5 minutes and without any lab equipmentCan be used at home to detect SARS-CoV-2Displayed 90% accuracy, 96% sensitivity, and 84% selectivity in a clinical sample studySchematic of COLOR technology in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis: 1) ACE2 immobilization on the surface of cotton swab, 2) sample collection, 3) attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to the swab, 4) incubation in AuNP-cys-ACE2 solution, and 5) color changes of both the swab and the AuNP-containing solution due to AuNP aggregation in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (bottom) or no color change without the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (top).Stage of Development:Minimum Viable ProductIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:21-9678-TpNCSWeb Published:6/26/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54515"

Unfortunately, this inclusion has resulted in adverse effects, including inflammation, lethargy, and internal lung tissue damage. These unresolved side effects currently render such lung-targeted LNPs unsuitable for human therapeutic use.Solution:Extensive mouse model testing inDr. Brenner'slab has identified excessive coagulation occurs as a result of cationic LNP delivery and is the primary cause of these downstream acute side effects. Addressing this issue could involve several strategies: pre-treatment of patients with direct thrombin inhibitors such as Bivalirudin, limiting nanocarrier size to less than 100nm, and attaching anticoagulants such as PPACK to the LNP's surface. These measures effectively mitigate coagulation while preserving the lung-targeting capabilities of LNPs in mouse models.Advantages:Pretreatment with Bivalirudin (an anticoagulant agent) prevents coagulation while sustaining the lung-targeting capacity of nanocarriers.Nanocarrier surface attachment of anticoagulant agents eliminates the need for a separate anticoagulant administration.Altering nanocarrier size to less than 100 nm reduces fibrinogen uptake in the lung, preventing coagulation and preserving lung-targeting specificityStage of Development:In vivo proof of conceptIntellectual Property:Patent pendingReference Media:Omo-Lamai, S et al.;Adv Mater 2024 Feb 23 : e2312026.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:23-10449-TpNCSWeb Published:6/21/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54463"
University of Pennsylvania,Predicting Post-Surgical Cardiovascular Events via Extracellular Vesicle Analysis,18-8716,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54435,"Flow cytometry-based method for predicting post-surgical cardiovascular events.Problem:Cardiovascular events that occur after non-cardiac vascular surgery are significantly associated with post-surgical mortality. In fact, the mortality rate of patients who experience heart attacks following non-cardiac vascular surgery is 65%. Additionally, one in five patients suffer a cardiovascular event within one year of surgery. Stratification of patient population by risk factors is crucial to inform management of pre-, peri-, and post-surgical care for better outcome. Various intervention clinical trials aimed at improving surgical outcomes have produced conflicting results. A more precise and systematic approach is necessary.Solution:The inventors developed a flow cytometry-based method of analyzing extracellular vesicles (EVs) in patient samples collected prior to surgery to predict post-surgical cardiovascular event risk.Technology:The inventors demonstrated that surface markers on EVs collected prior to surgery (including CD31, CD105, and CD64) may predict risk of cardiovascular events following a non-cardiac surgical procedure (full panel includes: CD47, CD3, CD31, CD105, CD64, CD41a, and CD144). Analysis of EVs was done by 1) collecting pre-surgical patient blood samples, 2) isolating EVs, 3) labeling EV isolate, and 4) analyzing via high-sensitivity flow cytometry. The presence of EVs expressing CD31+, CD105+, and CD64+ was significantly correlated with cardiovascular events.Advantages:Cost effectiveRapid analysisCan achieve higher sensitivity and specificity in predicting cardiovascular events than any existing methodology.Graph comparing the discovered EV phenotype in the two groups of patients.

Conventional range modulators, primarily varying in thickness, lack the precision needed, especially for irregular tumor shapes with varying dose requirements across regions.Technology:Using the PixelPrint method developed at Penn, inventors have created a process and system for manufacturing 3D-printed modulators with heterogeneous densities, which enable control over spatial dose distribution in radiation therapy. This approach facilitates the design of personalized range modulators tailored to the specific tumors of individual patients. Beyond custom-made modulators for each patient, the technology also supports the use of modular units with varied densities.

Neural networks are some of the most powerful machine learning algorithms, but they train very slowly when they become large. This hampers software pipelines involving data collection, machine learning, and analysis in real-time computing applications. In addition, current CPU and GPU-based neural networks consume vast amounts of electrical power.Solution:Designing a physical (circuit-based) neural network that learns using only local information at each node offers fast, scalable, and power-efficient performance. This product leverages the optimization built into the laws of physics to train the neural network on known data. The design is computationally efficient and scalable down to low-power microelectronic applications.Technology:Electrical current follows the most efficient path through a circuit. This built-in optimization inspired the authors to design a locally-learning network of individual circuits. Cycling through “free states” – letting the current follow the easiest path – and “clamped states” – forcing the network to output the correct voltage – settles the network via gradient descent. This finds the optimal network state for a given machine learning application.Advantages:Computes faster than current O(n2) CPU-based methods.May physically scale down to microelectronic (10-6m) scale.Current design contains only 15 elements per circuit, and 16 circuits total.Low-power, cost-efficient, and robust against damage.Free (left) and clamped (right) states of the network. The free state sets the voltage at the red nodes and allows the blue node to achieve its natural steady-state voltage. The clamped mode sets all three colored nodes to have specific voltages.

University of Pennsylvania,A Stable Post-Pyloric Retention Gastrojejunal (GJ) Feeding Tube That Minimizes Dislodgement,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54320,"The proposed invention is a gastric-jejunal (GJ) feeding tube that includes a retention device to maintain its position once placed in a patient.Problem:Enteral feeding devices, e.g., gastric (G) or gastrojejunal (GJ) feeding tubes, offer a safe and efficient means of delivering essential nutrition directly into the gastrointestinal tract. In particular, GJ tubes deliver directly to the jejunum (middle part of the small intestine) and are desirable long-term solutions. Existing GJ tubes incorporate retention modifications (e.g., balloons and discs) to keep the tube from falling out. However, these designs do not address a common problem - the migration of the jejunal component backward into the stomach, a medical emergency requiring urgent intervention to position the tube back into the jejunum.Solution:The inventor proposed a new GJ tube design with a post-pyloric retention device to help maintain its positioning in the small intestine once placed. The post-pyloric retention device leverages the natural anatomy (e.g., strong muscle and narrow lumen) of the junction between the stomach and small intestine to improve stability and prevent the GJ tube from moving backward.Technology:The present invention is a GJ tube containing a post-pyloric retention device immediately distal to the pylorus. The pylorus is a naturally narrow channel that prevents the retention device from dislodging and migrating back into the stomach. The retention component may be an inflatable balloon or other deployable retention device, which secures the entirety of the tube once inflated. This design effectively improves the stability of the GJ tube and avoids dislodgement by leveraging the natural anatomy of the junction between the stomach and small intestine.Advantages:Improve GJ tube retention and address the migration and dislodgement issues by adding a post-pyloric retention device.Improve gastrojejunal (GJ) retention: Keep the jejunal component of the tube from migrating back into the stomach.Less gastric outlet obstruction: Avoid possible gastric outlet obstruction by placing the retention device distal to the gastric outlet.Allow for shorter duodenal/jejunal portion of GJ tube: Increase the potential absorptive area of the gut and provide more physiologic delivery of nutrition into the duodenum rather than the jejunum.Prevent migration events that may result in unnecessary hospitalization, emergency room visits, and procedures, as well as significant dissatisfaction among patients and caregivers due to disruptions in routines, concerns about receiving adequate nutrition and/or hydration, etc.Potentially provide a safe and long-term feeding solution for patients who are immobile or immobilized.Stage of Development:Proof of ConceptIntellectual Property:Provisional FiledReference Media:Kuo, YC et al.J Vasc Interv Radiol 2008 Apr  (19)4: 557.Trerotola, SO et al.J Vasc Interv Radiol 2003 Nov (14)11: 1387.Trerotola, SO et al.J Vasc Interv Radiol 2005 Dec (16)12: 1613.Trerotola, SO and Pyeritz, RE.J Vasc Interv Radiol 2009 June (20)6: 824.Trerotola, SO et al.J Vasc Interv Radiol 2010 Feb (21)2: 203.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:23-10338-TpNCSWeb Published:5/31/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54320"

Such sensors often require power sources for standalone implementation. These power sources may be used to drive electronic components, take electrochemical measurements, and enable wireless communication with other external devices. To fully realize fully biodegradable sensor systems for these applications, their power sources must also be biodegradable.Solution:Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania developed a method to fabricate metal-air batteries from biodegradable materials that operate in air or on/under soil. The battery can be scaled down to the approximate size of a corn-kernel for potential deployment with planters. The use of biodegradable materials allows for terrestrial implementation with lower sustainability risks compared to commercial batteries. A power source can be more stable on the surface and below it if it is enclosed in wax, which shields it from the surrounding conditions.The disclosure demonstrated the fabrication of zinc-air batteries constructed from thin-film-based anodes, catalyst-containing cathodes, a biodegradable gel electrolyte, and a wax-based enclosure. Material selection is leveraged to allow for the preferential permeation of oxygen relative to the passage of water or carbon dioxide to power the battery. The technology can deliver a consistent output voltage of up to 1.2 volts for months in the air and underground, thanks to accurate power cell design. Current work involves further optimization to transition the batteries into integrated sensor platforms for wireless applications.Advantages:A fabrication route to construct metal-air electrochemical cells (e.g., Zn-air) from biodegradable materials with selective passage of relevant chemical species for operation (water, oxygen, carbon dioxide).Provides a route to assemble the metal-air electrochemical cell with a biodegradable enclosure (e.g., wax) for ambient protection, allowing for stability in subsurface environments (e.g., soil) as well as air environments.Displays battery performance in surface and sub-surface environments such as soil over months-long periods with output voltages up to 1.2 volts, highlighting potential for usage in wireless sensors.Cross-sectional view of the fabrication process for Zinc-air batteries composed of biodegradable materials and sealed in a wax-based enclosure.

These methods only produce homogenous PINFs that have a uniform composition and structure throughout the thickness. Heterostructured PINFs with varying structures would be useful for certain applications including drug delivery, membrane separation, and photonics, but there is a lack of scalable and controllable methods to produce such PINFs.Solution:The inventors developed a scalable and controllable method to produce tunable heterostructued PINFs with a high-volume fraction of nanoparticles. The thickness and porosity of these PINFs can be modulated, creating films with varying physical and optical properties that can be customized for different applications. Additionally, the method does not use organic solvents, making it eco-friendly.Technology:A layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanoparticles is spin-coated onto a layer of larger polystyrene nanoparticles. These dispersions may also be mixed and blade-coated in one step for better manufacture scaling. The bilayer is heated above polystyrene’s glass temperature (100⁰C), and the polystyrene particles melt and wick into the SiO2 layer. The space occupied by the polystyrene nanoparticles is left void of SiO2 nanoparticles. The film’s refractive index can be tuned by changing the relative volume of inorganic nanoparticles, and therefore the relative pore size. Films of alternating refractive indices can be stacked to form a Bragg reflector.Advantages:Greater than 60% volume fraction of nanoparticlesAllows for production of nanoparticle films specific to different applicationsEco-friendly option that eliminates need for organic solventsThe figure shows SEM images before and after nanocomposite annealing.

While recent progress in mRNA technology has allowed the rapid development of SARS-COV2 vaccines, these protective responses often require high doses and boosting to generate long lived protective T cell responses.Solution:Dr. Hunter and his team have developed a method to promote T-cell immune responses to vaccines, by delivering mRNA that encodes cytokine (IL-12 or IL-27) concurrently with the antigen encoding mRNA. With this approach, they enable the future development of new vaccines by “mixing and matching” target antigens with different cytokines to enhance the memory T cell pool.Technology:The inventors previously discovered the importance of IL-27 in eliciting immune responses of CD8+ T cells post-mRNA LNP immunization. To validate this vaccine approach, the inventors first test IL-27 overexpression in vivo with a low dose of the antigen encoding mRNA. They then test the effects of the cytokine/antigen combination vaccine for restoring T cell expansion in IL-27 knock-out mice demonstrating the ability to produce functional cytokine in vivo. In wildtype mice administration of the cytokine/antigen combination vaccine improves the size of the CD8+ T cell memory pool, which is essential for long-term protection. Further, inclusion of cytokine mRNA improved the therapeutic efficacy of an anti-tumor antigen vaccine. Similar studies utilizing IL-12 mRNA showed that IL-12 could also be leveraged to improve memory CD8+ T cell formation and therapeutic efficacy of mRNA-LNPs to malignancy.Advantages:All the components of the LNP-mRNA vaccine can be modified, including the components that make up the LNPs and cytokine sequenceA small single dosage of the vaccine can induce a 10-fold increase in IL-12 or IL-27 expression in vivoCytokine mRNA (IL-12 or IL-27) improves the induction of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses to the vaccineCytokine mRNA (IL-12 or IL-27) augments memory CD8+ T cell poolCytokine mRNA (IL-12 or IL-27) enhances the efficacy of a therapeutic vaccine against murine melanomaStage of Development:Target IdentifiedPreclinical DiscoveryIntellectual Property:PCTFiledReference Media:Park, J et al.Infect Immun, 2019 Dec, 87(12): – e00455-19.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:22-10096-TpNCSWeb Published:5/15/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54201"

Currently, there are insufficient methods available to characterize bacteria from other samples, especially those that are capable of bacterial sorting. While modern methods such as metagenomics or metatranscriptomics can detect range and diversity of bacteria in the microbiome, the methods are limited by their ability to measure shifts in composition to functional changes. Thus, there is a need for a tool capable of not only obtaining bacterial signatures, but also of tracking changes in composition for longitudinal studies. Finding such methods will allow for better characterization of human gut microbiomes and have great implications for host health.Solution:This disclosure presents a microfluidic system using electrophoresis for multi-parameter analysis such as charge, shape, size, and deformability for single bacterial cells. This methodology provides advanced physical analysis while being compatible with current microfluidic sorting technology used in research. The technology has potential to also bridge classical physical characterization with current molecular analyses such as single-cell genomics. When coupled to downstream sorting, the physical characterization of the technology can be utilized to bypass repetitive isolation of biological species higher in abundance.Technology:The inventors leverage transverse AC electrophoresis in a microfluidic system for physical characterization, a novel process combining particle tracking velocimetry and AC electrophoresis. By applying electric waves transversely to bulk flow, particles oscillate allowing for characterization of size and charge through particle oscillation. By modulating the parameters of the electric field and timing of application, hydrodynamic shape and deformabilities can be further collected. Large dimensions in the microchannel of the microfluidic device allow for facile characterization without clogging of the device and averaging multiple wave cycles allows for increased precision in characterization.Advantages:Characterizes a single bacteria’s charge, size, shape, and deformability in a single analysisAvoids water hydrolysis and bubble production for facile characterization with short inter-electrode distancesCan acquire fecal microbiome signatures rapidly (in minutes to seconds) and inexpensively (uses commercial materials)Has potential to be extended for use in other biological particles such as mammalian cells and virionOverview of the transverse AC electrophoresis microfluidic system: (Left) schematic of the microchannel used in the device; and, (Right) the integration of on-line labeling.Stage of Development:Bench PrototypeIntellectual Property:Utility Patent Application 18/587,324 FiledReference Media:Choi, M.

This innovative method projects accurate insertion points for screws directly onto the surgical field and interactively guides the surgeon to drill corresponding screw holes with the correct orientation and depth. This approach circumvents the need for fluoroscopy by employing an augmented reality interface tailored to the individual's anatomy, thereby enhancing procedural accuracy and reducing recovery times.Technology:The NailedIt software application enables display of comprehensive pre-operative surgical details on both the desktop display and in the head-mounted display (HMD) worn by the surgeon. This includes the current surgical plan and precise instructions. The system also is compatible with a variety of HMD and mobile augmented reality (AR) devices. Beyond text-based instructions, surgeons can see markups of the physical surgical site superimposed over their normal field of view as well view interactive 3D graphical anotations that guide the surgeon through each step of the procedure. Critical information displayed in real-time includes the location of distal nail holes,  current position and orientation of drill guides and other tracked instruments,  desired drill axis postion and orientation and depth of the currently drilled hole. Furthermore, the guidance provided by this innovative augmented reality system can be shared among a team of surgeons, enhancing collaboration and precision. This platform technology allows for expansion into other orthopaedic care spaces where navigation can be beneficial such as minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis, spine, hip or pelvis.Advantages:Decreased radiation exposureDecreased operative timeIncreased accuracy using patient-specific anatomySurgeons can collaborate in the AR space during procedureCan work with different AR devicesDevice company agnostic (can be used with any IM Nail system)NailedIt Application comprising the desktop/server software, the HMD AR interface, and use of the smart insertion handle with accompanying surgical guide during a demoed procedure.Stage of Development:Bench Prototype (minimally viable product)Intellectual Property:Provisional FiledReference Media:NailedIt ProjectDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:22-9939-TpNCSWeb Published:4/10/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/53942"
University of Pennsylvania,A Stretch-Activated Adhesive Microcapsule For The Controlled Release of Drugs In Wound-Healing Dressings,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/53913,"An adhesive drug-loaded microcapsule which releases therapeutic cargo upon mechanical stretching.Problem:Medicated dressings can improve healing of open wounds and improve pain management in patients. However, drug-coated bandages lack stimuli-response release mechanisms, so therapeutics are not released in a controlled and sustained manner. Poor control of cargo release in current wound-healing membranes generates large fluctuations in dosing, whereas controlled release mechanisms create relatively constant drug concentrations at the wound site. Stable drug-release maintains therapeutic dose over the entire duration of wound-healing and promotes better antimicrobial and pain-killing effects.Solution:The technology is mechanically-activated microcapsules (MAMCs) which can be loaded with therapeutic cargo. The MAMCs are coated in an adhesive polymer so they can be bonded to fabrics, membranes, or bandages. Once MAMC-coated dressings are applied to a wound, stretching of the material due to bodily movement induces tensile strain which releases drug from capsules at the wound site. The mechano-responsive microcapsules can be loaded with any combination of antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medication and painkillers depending on the medical need.Technology:Uniform drug-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolide) acid microcapsules are made using a capillary microfluidic device. Strain-responsive polymeric capsules are coated with poly-dopamine which serves as an adhesive for coating MAMCs onto wound-healing fabrics and membranes. When mechanical strain is applied to MAMC-coated materials, therapeutic molecules are released form microcapsules due to Poisson-ratio squeezing, controlling the release of drugs.Advantages:Adhesive coating prevents detachment of drug-loaded microcapsules from wound dressingsSignificant drug release from adhesive microcapsules at 50% stretch strain(a) Microscopy images of gauze embedded with MAMCs.

Novel antimicrobial agents are needed to treat the 35,000 annual deaths from antibiotic resistant infections. While antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have antibiotic potential, they lack potency to fight infections. The ability to modify AMPs and improve their antibiotic properties would result in a new generation of antimicrobial agents.Solution:The modified AMPs have robust antibiotic properties against lethal, drug resistant bacteria. The AMPs also disrupt biofilm formation when combined with low doses of common antibiotics.Technology:The inventors used computational modeling to determine the ideal pairing of AMP and activating protein sequence. The sequence is added to the AMP to improve its enzymatic activity. The modified AMPs have increased effectiveness against antibiotic resistant bacteria. The AMPs permeabilize bacterial membranes with reduced red blood cell toxicity.

University of Pennsylvania,An Effective Method to Evaluate the Risk of Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) Using Endotrophin (ProC6) Biomarkers.,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/53596,"Measuring endotrophin (ProC6) in plasma predicts the risk of death, heart failure admission, and composite cardiovascular events in HFpEF patients.Problem:HFpEF, which accounts for over half of heart failure (HF) cases, is a condition in which the heart cannot supply enough oxygen and nutrients to the body despite normal ejection fraction levels. Widely used biomarkers, such as MAGGIC risk score and NT-proBNP, failed to predict the risk of the disease. Despite the availability of treatments and disease management approaches (e.g., blood pressure management and lifestyle modification), the 5-year mortality remains high at approximately 76% due to unpredicted cardiovascular events. Thus, there is a need for biomarkers that can effectively predict HFpEF.Solution:The inventor identified a blood biomarker, endortrophin (i.e., collagen ProC6 neoepitope or ProC6), which strongly predicts the risk of (1) Death, (2) heart failure admission, and (3) other cardiovascular events (e.g., resuscitated cardiac arrest) in HFpEF patients and greatly outperforms other biomarkers (e.g., MAGGIC risk score and NT-proBNP).Endotrophin (ProC6) is a collagen type VI–derived peptide that has not been studied in human heart failure (HF). To examine the association between circulating endotrophin and outcomes in HFpEF patients, the inventors measured the endotrophin level in plasma samples of 205 patients enrolled in the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial. Then, the inventors conducted a participant-level meta-analysis (n=810) comprising six independent studies to further validate the findings. They discovered that high plasma concentrations of endotrophin were strongly associated with death, heart failure admission, and other primary endpoints of the trial (e.g., cardiovascular death or resuscitated cardiac arrest).Advantages:A newly identified prognostic biomarker that can predict and stratify the risk of (1) Death, (2) heart failure admission, and (3) other cardiovascular events (e.g., resuscitated cardiac arrest) in HFpEF patients.Superior predictive power of death or HF admission compared with MAGGIC risk score alone or combined with NT-proBNP.Provide prognostic information that is largely independent of MAGGIC risk score and NT-proBNP.Adding endotrophin to existing models (e.g., MAGGIC risk score and NTproBNP) significantly improved their Harrel’s C index and reclassification.Potential application in predicting the risk of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models that include endotrophin (ProC6), NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro B-type Natriuretic Peptide), and MAGGIC (Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure) risk score as predictors of: (A) the primary endpoint (including cardiovascular mortality, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for the management of HF), (B) all-cause death, and (C) death or heart failure–related hospital admission (DHFA) in TOPCAT trials (n=205). The endotrophin levels in plasma were associated with the TOPCAT primary endpoint (standardized hazard ratio [HR]=2.10; 95% CI=1.62–2.71; P<0.001), all-cause death (standardized HR=1.74; 95% CI=1.36–2.24; P<0.001), and DHFA (standardized HR=2.11; 95% CI=1.67–2.67; P<0.001).

University of Pennsylvania,"A Precise, Analytical Model to Measure Visual Function and Monitor Retinal Disease",23-10412,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/53546,"A model to estimate the change in photoreceptor outer segment length that occurs upon light stimulation – a biomarker of cone function in the retina.Problem:Vision relies on the isomerization of photopigments within photoreceptors (cones and rods) by light. Traditionally, researchers and clinicians have relied on functional assessments of photoreceptor function such as electroretinography (ERG) to diagnose and treat retinal disease. While these techniques are sensitive to photoreceptor loss, their resolution is insufficient to discern functional changes in individual photoreceptors. Retinal imaging with adaptive optics (AO)-enhanced ophthalmoscopes is noninvasive and has the resolution necessary to observe human photoreceptors at a cellular scale and detect structural abnormalities; however, there is a need for methods that analyze this imaging data as a noninvasive alternative to quantifying visual function.Solution:A model-based analytical tool for AO data that estimates the change in photoreceptor outer segment length upon light stimulation rather than standardizing reflectance to a pre-stimulation interval. The photoreceptor change in length is associated with cellular function, so this estimation provides a non-invasive biomarker of cone function with increased precision, signal to noise ratio, customizability, and high spatial resolution.A method for extracting the functional responses of single cone photoreceptors to light stimulation from AO imaging data. Previous methods estimate single cone responses by quantifying variability in the amount of light reflected at each time point. The method described here provides a model-based approach of analyzing the same measurements to describe the effect of a change in cone optical path length (OPL) on the reflected light, accounting for the heterogeneity of the response across acquisitions. By fitting the model to the data from multiple acquisitions for each cone, that change in cone OPL over time is estimated directly.Advantages:This method demonstrates an improved signal-to-noise ratio compared to the existing variability-based method.Functional results obtained via this model may be compared against and/or calibrated with measurements of the same phenomena using other measurement modalities.The physically-based analysis approach may be more readily associated with the underlying biophysical mechanisms that mediate cone functionSingle-cone AO optoretinography is noninvasive and offers the possibility of functional measurements in the areas of the human retina with the highest cone density and smallest cone size.This model can be customized by changing key parameters, optimizing the basic formulation to different conditions, generalizing across various metrics, or varying the data fitting procedure, among others.Stage of Development:Proof of ConceptBench PrototypeReference Media:Warner, RL et al.Biomed Opt Express 2022 Dec 1; 13(12): 6561.Lassoued, A et al.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2021 Nov 18, 118(47): e2107444118.Cooper et al.Opt Express 2020 Dec 21; 28(26): 39326.Pandiyan, VP et al.Sci.

EVs play a critical role in intercellular communication and have enormous potential as biomarkers for a wide range of biomedical applications. Because EVs are heterogenous, there has been an effort to measure EVs at the single particle resolution. However, current assays for EV detection do not have the sensitivity to detect individual nanoscale EVs, lack the specificity to distinguish EV subpopulations, and have insufficient throughput to probe rare EV subpopulations.Solution:The Droplet-based Extracellular Vesicle Analysis (DEVA) platform is a high-throughput, ultrasensitive digital assay that can quantify rare EV subpopulations at the single particle resolution by capitalizing on the parallelization of droplet generation, processing, and analysis of EVs.Technology:The DEVA assay uses fluorescent paramagnetic microbeads conjugated to a capture antibody that binds to the surface protein of EV subpopulations from samples. Captured EVs are further processed by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), where they are labeled with a biotinylated antibody and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme to form enzyme-linked immunocomplexes. The EV-bead immunocomplexes are mixed with a fluorescence enzyme substrate, loaded into aqueous droplets using parallelized droplet generators, and flowed through a detector with 90 parallelized microfluidic channels where a machine vision camera records the encoded fluorescent signal (from enzyme-substrate reaction) and transfers the data to cloud computation for analysis.Advantages:Achieves 100-fold improvement in throughput (~20 million drops/min) compared to standard single EV characterization methodsCan be multiplexed to analyze >100 EV subpopulations simultaneouslyCapable of quantifying rare EV subpopulations from complex samples with high backgroundReduces the limit of detection (LOD) to 9EVs/uL, which represents a 100-fold improvement in LOD compared to the gold standard assay for EV detectionUses accessible and affordable optics (<$1,000) and fabrication methods(A) Target EVs can be captured from complex samples such as plasma using DEVA.

However, these integrated photonics processors require intricate construction, necessitating costly and sensitive lithography. Further, these devices require exponentially complex architectures as they are scaled up for modern, large dataset technologies. In addition, existing platforms are static and require error-prone lithographic manufacturing, limiting yield. To meet the information processing requirements necessary to advance large scale technologies like artificial intelligence, improved computing power by eliminating the information transfer and manufacturing constraints of traditional processors is required.Solution:A lithography-free method to generate an integrated photonics processor that allows for reconfigurable control of an imaginary index on a semiconductor platform. This allows light-speed information transfer without the energy loss or heat generation of electrical processors. Using spatially distributed optical gain and loss, the device mimics complex lithographic pathways, creating flexible optical “circuits” without the need for expensive and highly precise manufacturing. Because of this flexibility, these pathways can be optimized via on-chip training to shape the processor to the specific application. This reconfigurable integrated photonic processor outperforms current methods by providing the potential to process large, non-local datasets with the throughput necessary for modern artificial intelligence applications.Technology:Dynamically altering spatial patterning of optical gain across a central unpatterned slab of III-V semiconductor provides the basis for circuit construction. Optical coding of patterned light delivered by a spatial light modulator (SLM) defines the gain and loss distribution across the semiconductor wafer, spatially modulating an imaginary index that takes the place of a real index constructed by lithography.

Poor planning in the shuffle phase can significantly impede system throughput and latency. This phase poses a primary bottleneck in data analytics on emerging cloud platforms, and optimizing it is challenging due to workload dependencies and evolving data center architectures, compounded by the growing complexity of big data systems using disaggregated storage and intricate network interactions.Solution:The inventors have proposed a templated shuffle (TeShu) layer that can adapt to application data and data center infrastructure, enabling it to serve as an extensible unified service layer common to all data analytics, on top of which existing and future systems can be built.Technology:TeShu is a technology that optimizes data shuffling in distributed systems for improved performance and adaptability.

TeShu's adaptive capabilities consider workload, combiner logic, shuffle patterns, and network topology, enhancing shuffle efficiency. It instantiates execution plans at runtime, directing the shuffle data for higher layers, and can be used as a service by various big data platforms.

Current methods for cyclic polymerization make use of catalysts with lengthy synthetic techniques and costly purification requirements. Additionally, the metals used in these catalysts, such as Rhodium (Rh), Molybdenum (Mo), and Tungsten (W), are expensive, limiting their commercial potential and rely on imports from countries around the globe (China (top producer), Vietnam, Russia, Bolivia and Rwanda), which puts a large demand on a volatile supply chain.Solution:A class of catalysts that can be synthesized in two steps using base metals, rather than expensive platinum group and heavier metals. This type of catalyst is less expensive and easier to make compared to current technologies, and can be made in gram-quantities, allowing for facile scale-up.Technology:A catalyst consisting of an allene dianion ligand, [Me3SiCCCSiMe3]2-and a base metal, such as Ti (Titanium), V (Vanadium), or Fe (Iron).

By addressing the need for synthetic routes capable of large-batch production of catalysts, the catalyst addresses a longstanding need for the development of industrial cyclic conjugated polymer materials. Furthermore, these cyclic conjugated polymers can be further functionalized with existing technologies to make bottlebrush polymers, conductive polymers, and unsaturated polymers that resemble commercial polymers.Advantages:Use of base metals Ti, V, and Fe are less expensive than the traditional metals used for cyclic polymerization catalysts such as Rh, Mo, and W.Two-step ligand synthesis followed by single-step metalation provides an easy, inexpensive synthetic route for a cyclic polymerization catalyst compared to traditional catalysts.Gram-scale production of the catalyst indicates that scale-up for industrial use is feasible.Metal identity is shown to be variable, allowing for flexibility in synthetic route and scale-up compared to traditional cyclic polymerization catalysts.Previous technology to access cyclic conjugated polymers (top).

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing public health concern and, thus far, no significant technological advance has capitalized on this market.Solution:The inventors developed an algorithm to mine the human proteome for the first time as a source of antibiotics. The human proteome contains a plethora of peptides that conduct countless functions. Here, the inventors discovered that many of these peptides have antimicrobial activity outside of their primary function in the cell, and these newly discovered antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) do not readily select for bacterial resistance and display potent anti-infective activity in preclinical mouse models.Technology:The inventors used a computational approach to mine the human proteome for peptides with specific physicochemical properties.

This process is usually done manually by doctors, for whom recognizing the region of interest (ROI) is trivial, but highlighting the accurate boundaries of the part can be very labor-intensive. In contrast, AI models struggle with recognizing the location of an ROI in the image but can quickly delineate the organ of interest from the rest of the image once the ROI is identified. Users are often forced to choose between the opposing approaches without finding a comfortable middle ground.Solution:Researchers have now developed a method to combine the ability of humans to recognize the ROI and the accurate delineation abilities of AI to create an automated hybrid intelligence organ recognition and delineation model, mitigating both methods' weaknesses. This process has four steps. First, a computer trims the picture from the medical scan. Then, the computer makes a rough guess about the important part within the picture based on what a knowledgeable human would guess. After that, the computer draws boxes around that area. Finally, the computer makes the selected part look neat and tidy.Technology:The model encompasses four distinct phases in image analysis. Initially, the computer system conducts image cropping, denoted as BRR (Body Region Recognition) during the first phase. In the subsequent stage, the system employs a fuzzy recognition approach, named AAR-R (Automatic Anatomy Recognition - Object Recognition), which incorporates human knowledge, to annotate the area of interest. Following this, the system applies a convolutional deep learning network to establish 2D bounding boxes around the identified region, referred to as DL-R (Deep Learning-Based Object Recognition). Lastly, the fuzzy region generated by the preceding phase is precisely delineated with smooth boundaries by an AI system, referred to as DL-D (Deep Learning-Based Object Delineation). When tested on thoracic and head and neck medical images, this approach achieved accuracy at least as good as manual methods for organ segmentation and was more than 70% faster.Advantages:Scores with at least as good accuracy as of clinical manual delineation methods, which represent the reference standard70% faster when compared to the reference standardCompatible with large data set analysis in which analysis is time-sensitiveAvoids the need for AI models to be trained on high-level anatomic dataHigh adaptability allows it to find potential utility in all manner of imaging data, including CT, MRI, and PET scansA schematic representation of the different stages (modules) in the proposed hybrid intelligence (HI) system.

University of Pennsylvania,High-Throughput and Independent Temperature Regulation In Biological Samples,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54359,"A device that provides independent thermal regulation for biological samples in a 96-well microwell plate.Problem:Thermal control of cellular processes allows for remote control through tissue or opaque media, allowing for precise targeting of therapies in the body as well as broad control of metabolic processes in bioreactors. However, current research tools for modulating the temperature of biological samples are slow, expensive, and often limited to small numbers of concurrent samples. There exists a need for a high-throughput method to modulate the temperature of biological samples.Solution:The inventors developed a device capable of housing a 96-well microwell plate and independently adjusting the temperature of the sample in each well. Furthermore, the device is compatible with most assays designed for 96-well plates in addition to traditional cell culture incubators. The inventors have successfully used the device to regulate temperature in mammalian cell cultures.Technology:The device consists of an Arduino microprocessor paired with a custom printed circuit board. The circuit board allocates a pair of waterproofed thermistors to each well of the 96-well plate. One thermistor provides heating to the sample while the other measures the current temperature. A proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control algorithm adjusts the duty ratio of each heating thermistor to maintain the user-defined temperature.Advantages:Independent temperature for individual samples in 96-well platesSupports dynamic temperature regulation profilesCompatible with existing research tools designed for 96-well platesDesign and use of the ThermoPlate for simultaneous, independent temperature control of multiple wells in a 96 well plate.

Inventors at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine demonstrated that RNA-based speckle signature is evident in 24 different cancer types and can be used as a predictor of cancer patient survival in 6 cancer types. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) showed the particularly prominent correlation and is known to be associated with hyperactivation of HIF-2a in nearly all clinical cases. In ccRCC, inventors find differential drug sensitivities to drugs such as PD1 and HIF-2α inhibitors.Further, using immunofluorescent imaging of nuclear speckle protein, SON, inventors demonstrated that SON distribution in the nucleus strongly correlated with ccRCC patient survival. Hence, RNA or imaging methods may be used interchangeably for nuclear speckle assessment.Advantages:Selection marker for ccRCC patients for treatment with HIF2α  inhibitorsDetermination of drug sensitivity of ccRCC patientsCancer patient outcomes predictions 6 cancer types, particularly in ccRCCA: ccRCC patient overall survival in response to nivolumab (PD1 inhibitor) or everolimus (mTOR inhibitor) in patients with different RNA-based speckle signatures.B: Kaplan Meier plot of ccRCC split by SON immunofluorescence pattern in the nucleusC: Kaplan Meier plot of Grade 1 and 2 ccRCC split by SON immunofluorescence pattern in the nucleus.Stage of Development:Proof of ConceptIntellectual Property:Provisional FiledReference Media:Alexander, KA et al.Mol Cell, 2021 Apr 15, 81(8): 1666Alexander, KA et al.bioRxiv, 2023 Sept 16: preprintDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:22-9922-TpNCSWeb Published:11/28/2023Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/52839"
University of Pennsylvania,Pyrazole Derivatives for the Treatment of Lung Cancer Tumors,23-10336,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/52809,"A class of pyrazole derivatives that inhibit palmitoyl-transferases, resulting in increasing cancer cell responsiveness to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor and KRas mutant lung cancer growth inhibition as a single agent.Problem:Pancreatic and lung cancers are largely driven by either Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation KRAS mutations. However current therapies targeting either of these mutated proteins are either unavailable (KRas G12S/D/V/R) or rapidly develop resistance mutations (EGFR, KRas G12C). No targeted therapeutic options exist for mutant KRAS G12S/D/V/R tumors, making treatment of these cancers difficult and dependent on conventional chemotherapy and radiation.Solution:Pyrazole derivatives that increase sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors by creating a dependency on EGFR signaling for cancer cell survival, increasing responsiveness to EGFR inhibitor therapy. Additionally, the increase in EGFR signaling induces synthetic lethality in KRAS-mutation-bearing tumors. This treatment circumvents acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors and offers a therapeutic strategy for mutant KRAS tumors.Technology:The pyrazole derivatives target an EGFR palmitoylation enzyme, DHHC20, which modulates EGFR signaling. When DHHC20 is inhibited, EGFR signaling becomes crucial for cancer cell survival. Inhibiting DHHC20 also causes synthetic lethality in mutant KRAS tumors because oncogenic mutations in KRAS and EGFR are mutually exclusive, and the co-occurrence of these mutations is deleterious to the cancer cell.Advantages:A first-in-class drug that increases the response to current EGFR inhibitor drugs, increasing efficacy for these treatments in lung cancer patients.Offers a therapy independent of the type of KRAS mutation on the tumor, allowing for reliable treatment of these types of tumors via a single agent.Target pyrazole derivatives have been shown to inhibit KRAS mutant lung tumor growth in xenografts, significantly increasing overall survival with no impact on animal weight following oral dosing, demonstrating therapeutic potential.(A) Imaging of xenograft tumors grown from A549 (Kras G12S) human lung cancer cells stably transduced with inducible control shRNA or DHHC20 shRNA. shDHHC20.

University of Pennsylvania,Bio-Absorbable Envelope For Improved Breast Reconstruction Outcomes In Cancer Patients,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/53888,"Bio-absorbable mesh envelope for use in breast reconstruction to enhance long-term cosmetic outcomes and minimize operative time and cost.Problem:In the United  States, about 1 in 8 women will develop invasive breast cancer over their lifetime and this number is rising due to improved detection by screening and patient education. Numerous women elect to have some form of breast reconstruction after treatment or preventative mastectomy. However, it is currently very labor-intensive to achieve an aesthetically pleasing result. Plastic surgeons spend extensive intra-operative time to properly shape autologous tissue transfers into the complex shape of the human breast. Additionally, sutures often do not hold the tissue’s shape for extended periods, leading to revision operations.Solution:To overcome these issues, inventors including engineers, scientists and surgeons at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a bio-absorbable, mesh-based breast reconstruction envelope. The novel design provides increased tissue support and the ability to achieve the desired complex shape.Technology:The innovative design envelope contains a number of discontinuous cuts that form an elastic network that shapes and provides mechanical support to the implant, thereby mimicking the complex breast geometry that will facilitate tissue regeneration properly. The envelope  enables surgeons to use only a single ADM sheet to hold the implant in place. The kirigami ADM sheet can generate a natural teardrop breast contour, even when inserting round-shaped implants ranging from 400 to 620 cc in volume. The size of the mesh envelope can also be customized to each patient by using a template with re-sizing guidelines.Advantages:Improved support of transplanted tissues or implantEnhanced cosmetic outcomesShortened intra-operative times and reduced costPotential for patient-specific designsDemonstration of the Keller Funnel insertion of the round-shaped silicone gel implants of different volumes into the same optimized kirigami ADM sheet.

University of Pennsylvania,Suture Device for Rotator Cuff Surgery in Patients with Osteoporosis,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/52768,"An integrated device for anchor replacement and biologic cement injection during rotator cuff repair.The rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that surround the shoulder joint (humerus). When rotator cuffs tear due to injury, suture anchors are typically employed to reattach the torn rotator cuff tissue back on to the humerus. However, for patients with bone abnormalities—namely, osteoporosis— current devices often lack fixation strength, ultimately causing postoperative loosening out of the suture anchor. Moreover, the use of biologic cement to augment anchor strength is uncommon due to difficulties associated with current suture anchor designs and the risk of releasing excess bone cement, which can lead to inflammation.Solution:To improve the weak attachment of suture anchors in osteoporotic bones, the inventor designed a novel integrated device that implants an anchor and injects bone cement (calcium phosphate) during rotator cuff repair. Design of suture anchor and efficient injection of bone cement at same time improved the pull-out strength significantly relative to the existing anchors in saw bone model system.Advantages:Addresses the issue of anchor pullout and looseningImproves safety and reliability of calcium phosphate injection for rotator cuff repairUses a single device that integrates anchor driving and bone cement injectionStage of Development:ConceptIntellectual Property:US Patent Application in ProcessReference Media:Jia, L et al.UPOJ, 2021 June, 31: 182.(pdf)Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:22-10127-TpNCSWeb Published:11/10/2023Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/52768"

In addition, treatment of larger and deeper lesions is associated with permanent scarring or disfigurement.Solution:The inventors developed a topical targeted LSD1 inhibitor that effectively treats skin lesions without harming local tissue.Technology:LSD1 is a histone demethylase that regulates a wide range of physiological processes including stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Dysregulation of LSD1 can be oncogenic and is overexpressed in a variety of cancers. The inventors demonstrated that topical LSD1 inhibition suppressed cSCC in mice.

University of Pennsylvania,Direct and Effective Method To Reverse The Effects of Fragile X Syndrome,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/52729,"A method of treating Fragile X syndrome by correcting the abnormal DNA clusters causing the characteristic symptoms.Problem:Fragile X syndrome (FXS) affects approximately 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females and is characterized by symptoms such as:Inherited Intellectual DisabilityAnxietyAttention Deficit Disorder (ADD)Skin, Ovaries and Testes AbnormalitiesFXS is caused by an excess number of regulatory CGG trinucleotides found in the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, termed short tandem repeats (STRs).Compared to individuals with a normal number of STRs (30 to 40), those with over 200 STRs develop symptoms. The only current option for patients is symptom management with existing medications.Solution:Rather than addressing each symptom separately, this new method targets the root cause of FXS-associated symptoms by deleting the excess STRs, thus preventing abnormal DNA structures.Technology:The inventors linked the pathology of FXS to the formation of abnormal DNA clustering between excess STRs in the FMR1 gene and in genes of neighboring chromosomes, blocking their normal expression.The type of DNA abnormalities and FXS symptom severity depend on STR length, with more severe disease observed in patients with over 450 repeats. Excision of the excess STRs down to 190 repeats reverses this abnormal DNA clustering and restores expression in affected genes (see Figure 1).Shortening the STRs could be achieved using pharmacological or genetic-based methods.Advantages:Reduces the number of medications FXS patients must takeMore effective than treating symptomsMore specific than any option on the market currentlyCould be adapted to other diseases caused by STR abnormalities, such as Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Friedreich’s ataxiaSchematic model of abnormal DNA organization among short tandem repeats (STRs) in Fragile X Syndrome. When STRs (symbolized by CGG trinucleotides, red lines in the figure) are of normal length (30-40, first box, top row), the FMR1 gene (black arrow) does not cluster with distal genes on neighboring chromosomes (gray arrows). When STRs reach 55 to 190 repeats (premutation length, second box, top row), FMR1 expression increases and forms inclusion bodies in the nucleus (blue circle) but does not interact with distal genes. When the STRs reach 200 repeats (short mutation-length, third box, top row), FMR1 expression drastically decreases, DNA instability occurs and distal genes cluster together through interactions between H3K9me3 domains (pink shading), altering their expression. When STRs reach 450 repeats (long mutation-length, fourth box, top row), the FMR1 gene forms an RNA-DNA hybrid structure (green and blue lines) which silences distal genes. Cutting the STRs from 450 to 190 repeats (first box, bottom row) reverses the abnormal interactions between FMR1 and distal genes. By contrast, cutting FMR1 STRs from 450 repeats to normal-length 30-40 repeats (second box, bottom row) does not reverse the abnormal DNA clustering.Stage of Development:Target IdentifiedPreclinical DiscoveryIntellectual Property:US Utility Application US 2022-0323553 A1 FiledReference Media:Malachowski, T., et al.,Cell 186 2023 Dec. 21: Vol.186, Issue 26; 5840Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:20-9433-tpNCSWeb Published:11/6/2023Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/52729"
University of Pennsylvania,Low Toxicity Antimicrobial Peptides To Overcome Antibiotic Resistance,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/52723,"Combining naturally occurring peptides by hybridizing them with known active peptides to synthesize effective antimicrobial peptides with minimal cytotoxicity.Problem:Antibiotic resistance is a significant concern that poses a potential risk of increased harm from future infectious diseases. Consequently, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are regarded as an alternative to antibiotics as they are less prone to bacterial resistance. However, AMPs often exhibit toxicity, instability, and substantial costs. Therefore, careful design choices will have to be considered to address these challenges. One major hurdle that still needs to be surmounted is AMPs potential toxicity to human cells.Solution:To mitigate toxicity, a method has been developed that involves hybridization of peptides. This technique combines different segments of natural peptides to create hybridized AMPs (hAMPs). By leveraging the hybridization process, the antimicrobial properties of hAMPs are optimized while minimizing cytotoxicity.Technology:The design of hAMPs utilizes VmCT1, an AMP derived from scorpion venom, as well as other established amphiphilic AMP templates. Hybridized amphiphilic molecules are synthesized for therapeutic screening through a combination of hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties. Extensive testing evaluates these newly formed peptides' antimicrobial, antiplasmodial, and cytotoxic properties, enabling the identification of clinically relevant hAMPs.Advantages:hAMPs derivatives exhibit lower toxicity than the parent peptideshAMPs show strong resistance to proteolytic degradationTwo of the hAMPs showed stronger anti-infective properties in a mouse model than parent peptidesFlowchart showing the method of design for the hAMPs.

To enhance cellular interactions, the surfaces of liposomes are arrayed with proteins using nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-conjugated lipids. However, limited commercially available NTA-conjugated lipids exist. Further, the activity and stability of NTA-conjugated lipids decreases rapidly following exposure to air and within weeks to months following storage at -20°C.Solution:Janus dendrimers (JDs) are synthetic alternatives to natural lipids that effectively self-assemble, encapsulate high concentrations of organic compounds, and exhibit ideal mechanical properties allowing interactions with natural lipid bilayers. NTA-conjugated JDs exhibit increased stability and protein affinity when compared to NTA-conjugated lipids.Technology:Qi Xiao and the Percec group have developed JDs conjugated to both monovalent NTA and TrisNTA as biological membrane mimetics. Although TrisNTA provides greater protein affinity than monovalent NTA, TrisNTA is complex and expensive to synthesize. A modular, synthetic approach allowed for the development of a library of both JD-NTA and JD-TrisNTA compounds.

University of Pennsylvania,Double Digital Assay for Isolation and Analysis of Single Extracellular Vesicles for Early Detection of Disease Biomarkers Including Cancer,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/52562,"An ultrasensitive diagnostic tool that isolates single extracellular vesicles (EVs) and measures their contents to single molecule resolution.Problem:EVs contain biomolecules that can identify a variety of disease states and, thus, have emerged as a promising source for diagnostics. Within the EV diagnostic field, there are two major challenges: (1) the isolation and compartmentalization of single EVs to resolve their heterogeneity and (2) the precise measurement of the proteins contained within them, which tend to be of very low abundance. Previous attempts to isolate and analyze the contents of single EVs rely on bulk analysis of their molecular cargo and include techniques like modified flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging. However, these technologies have limitations of the inability to accurately quantify EV molecular cargo with ultra-high resolution.Solution:Here, a double digital assay overcomes the challenges of isolating and compartmentalizing single EVs as well as detecting their low-abundance proteinaceous contents. This technology flows a sample containing EVs over a microwell array and relies on the Poisson distribution to load single EVs into a single microwell. Then, an ultrasensitive digital enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dELISA) detects target proteins to single molecule resolution.Technology:This technology comprises two layers: a flow cell (top layer) and a honeycomb-inspired microwell array (bottom layer). Antibody-conjugated beads and spacer beads coat the bottom of the microwells. Sample containing EVs is flowed over the microwells, loading single EVs into single microwells. This technique relies on the Poisson distribution (l=0.1) to isolate single EVs whereby the statistical likelihood of two EVs being deposited into one well is very low. The EVs are then lysed, and their proteinaceous contents detected by dELISA, using tyramide signal amplification (TSA), which can detect analytes to single molecule resolution.Advantages:Does not require expensive equipment nor technically challenging methods of separationAllows for the detection of rare biomarkers that may be missed with bulk analysis techniquesAllows for detection of low abundance biomarkers that may be important for early detection of cancer and other diseasesSamples may be taken from patients’ blood, which is convenient and non-invasive compared to procedures such as tissue biopsySignificant (100-fold) improvement in the limit of detection over conventional ELISAFigure 1. (A) Schematic depicting the experimental overview of the double digital EV assay. Microwells are coated with antibody-conjugated beads separated by spacer beads. Sample containing EVs is flowed over the microwells whereby single EVs are deposited into single wells.

University of Pennsylvania,Versatile Algorithm For Safe And Accurate Deep Learning,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/52529,"Model-based robust deep learning algorithms allow for more accurate and robust predictions in varying environmental conditions.Problem:In applications that rely on safe and reliable predictions such as autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and robotics, it is essential that the prediction systems be made robust against nuisance variability such as changes in lighting or weather conditions. It is well known that various deep learning algorithms are fragile to seemingly innocuous changes to the environment such as background, lighting, blurring, or contrast. Currently there are no general-purpose algorithms that provide robustness against these variations in data.Solution:The novel model-based training paradigm comprises three training algorithms which provide robustness against many different forms of nuisance-based variation. The three training algorithms, which are broadly applicable to deep learning, produce training data that leads to more reliable predictive systems.Technology:A model of natural variation—a function which captures the variation in data—is first obtained either by learning the variation directly from data or by exploiting the physical laws governing the problem.  Depending on the setting, such models can capture nuisances in the data such as lighting, background color, haze, snow, or contrast.  Once a model has been obtained, it is used in conjunction with a robust optimization problem to train deep neural networks which are robust to the source of variation captured by the model.  The main insight is that the optimization problem seeks worst-case nuisances captured by the model, and then trains the neural networks to classify correctly on these worst-case data points.  In this work, three algorithmic variants are proposed which collectively facilitate a trade-off between robustness and efficiency.  This pipeline is, in principle, more flexible than standard classification, as it can integrate human priors regarding relevant nuisances by selecting or composing models of natural variation.Advantages:Provides safety to systems that rely on accurate prediction such as autonomous vehiclesReusable in any number of different machine-learning systems, allowing for a wide range of applications30 percentage point improvement over state-of-the-art image classifiers when tested on subsets of ImageNet-cCan be used in non-computer vision applications, providing more versatility than current image classifiersA gallery of learned models of natural variation.

The right side of the table shows examples of these generated images based on the type of natural variation (brightness, contrast, hue, etc.).  The three images in the brightness section, for example, show a range of generated images when the brightness parameter is tweaked.

University of Pennsylvania,Easily Fabricated Polymer Brushes For pH-Mediated Nanoparticle (NP) Control,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/52527,"A polymer brush coating on a substrate made through block copolymer coating and exfoliation for pH-mediated nanoparticle sorting, transport, and diffusion.Problem:NP-based technologies in fields such as biotherapeutics, separation, and purification require precise control of nanoparticle transport, absorption, and diffusion. Polymer brushes exhibit an effective stimuli-response surface for controlling the interaction with nanoparticles, with potential stimuli including the solution pH or external electric field. Existing methods of polymer brush preparation methods make use of complex chemical synthesis for brush fabrication. These techniques covalently bond polymer brushes using “grafting-from” or “grafting-to” methods on the substrate. These methods can be time consuming (e.g., growing a polymer brush from the surface), narrowly applicable, energy intensive, and expensive.Solution:A fabrication method that uses selective exfoliation of a block copolymer coating to expose brush material, avoiding work-intensive chemical grafting approaches. The brush swells and stretches in response to pH stimulus, allowing for selective adsorption of nanoparticles.Technology:A grafted polystyrene (gPS) layer is fabricated on an oxide substrate (e.g., SiO2) using an ω-hydroxy-terminated polystyrene (PS), resulting in a smooth, hydrophobic surface. Over this “primer” layer, a block copolymer coating, containing PS-block-poly (2-vinyl pyridine) (P2VP) layers, is thermally annealed on the gPS, forming a parallel lamellar bilayer with PS domains on top due to the high surface energy of P2VP. To invert the structure and obtain an outer P2VP domain, methanol is used in conjunction with sonication to selectively penetrate and dissolve the P2VP domain, removing the outermost PS-block-P2VP coating and exposing the P2VP outer domain. The P2VP domain, anchored to the gPS via the glassy PS domain, can stretch and swell in response to pH, allowing pH-mediated gold nanoparticle adsorption by controlling the permeability depending on the size of the nanoparticles.Advantages:Simple, robust exfoliation fabrication method that avoids the complex chemical grafting processes used for traditional polymer brushesTunable adsorption of nanoparticles with pH-dependent size selectivity, allowing for nanoparticle sorting, rather than just transport and diffusion applicationsBrushes can release nanoparticles back into solution, allowing for reusability(a) Schematic illustration of P2VP brush on a Si wafer (blue is PS and green is P2VP).

University of Pennsylvania,VASH1 Depletion for Heart Failure Therapy,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/52510,"Non-replicating viral delivery of shVASH1 to treat heart failure.Problem:Heart failure (HF) is condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood throughout the body to meet its need. Approximately 6 million American adults live with the condition, and close to 400,000 people die from it annually. Mainstay treatment for HF are lifestyle changes and medications that include ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, diuretics, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Despite several treatment options, the 5-year mortality rate remains high at approximately 75%.Solution:One hallmark of HF is increased stiffness of cardiomyocytes (CM), which is due to the detyrosination of cardiac microtubules. Vasohibin-1 (VASH1) is an enzyme that detyrosinates cardiac microtubules. The inventors discovered that VASH1 depletion was sufficient to reduce microtubule detyrosination and restore CM function.Technology:The inventors demonstrated that VASH1 protein could be depleted using short-hair RNA molecules in human CMs. Moreover, they showed that depletion of VASH1 resulted in significant reduction in detyrosinated tubulin expression. VASH1 knockdown was associated with increased contraction speed and relaxation in CMs isolated from patients with failing hearts. Finally, the inventors demonstrated that VASH1 knockdown reduced CM stiffness.Advantages:VASH1 depletion has minor effects on non-failing CMs.Potential for lower off-target effects (compared to the detyrosinating enzyme inhibitor parthenolide).Graphical representation of the relationship between microtubule detyrosination and cardiomyocyte function (TTL: Tubulin Tyrosine Ligase – enzyme that tyrosinates microtubules)Stage of Development:In vitro proof of concept in CMs isolated from patients with HFIntellectual Property:USPendingReference Media:Chen, CY et al.;Circ Res 2020 July 3; 127(2): e14Desired Partnerships:Co-developmentCase ID:20-9311-TpNCSWeb Published:10/2/2023Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/52510"

Accomplishing this requires phase locking, a challenging method combining multiple laser outputs. Previous approaches to address this issue can be applied only to a one-dimensional laser array or involve complicated designs, making it challenging to package densely or downsize. However, the development of scalable, single-mode high-powered lasers is crucial for developing light detection and ranging (LiDAR) applications used in technologies such as self-driving cars.Solution:The inventors take advantage of the physical concept of supersymmetry (SUSY), a theory derived from quantum mechanics. While the physical nature of other non-SUSY systems results in multiple competing laser modes (making single-mode laser arrays challenging), applying supersymmetry to laser arrays overcomes this limitation and allows the lasers' power to focus into a single mode, high-powered system.Technology:A SUSY-inspired microlaser array amplifies a single laser mode, providing a coherent high-powered signal. The design is scalable to any number of dimensions. It also does not require optical mode leakage communication between optical elements – a considerable simplification to existing single-mode technologies. This technology applies supersymmetry partners to a microlaser array. It has been experimentally demonstrated as a two-dimensional array and it can theoretically be applied to three-dimensional arrays as well.Advantages:First instance of supersymmetry (SUSY) techniques for 2D laser arrays (all previous arrays were limited to 1D)Twenty-five times (25x) increase in power output compared to single laser>100x power density compared to that of a single-mode laser arrayScalable design down to the order of micronsA multidimensional SUSY microlaser array, comprising a 5x5 main array with two SUSY partners and three auxiliary partner rings.

Currently, printed electronics manufactured on polymer substrates or paper with polymer coatings such as polyimide, are non-biodegradable.Solution:The inventors have developed biodegradable NCIP substrates with exceptional properties, including a smooth and non-porous surface.

University of Pennsylvania,Coherent Generation Of High-Dimensional Structured Light Using A Hyperdimensional Spin-Orbit Microlaser,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/52439,"The current invention describes next-generation high-capacity noise-resilient communication and computing technology. The invention describes a method to coherently generate high-dimensional structured light, including spin-orbit states, in an integrated and scalable way.Problem:On-chip information technologies are mostly limited to two-level systems due to the lack of sufficient reconfigurability to satisfy the stringent requirement for degrees of freedom, i.e., for a system with more than two energy levels, a very large number of independent parameters or degrees of freedom must be precisely controlled to generate the desired high-dimensional structured light. Generally, the expansion of dimensionalities relies on the complicated interferometric setup, which is cumbersome, requires manual tuning, and is not scalable. Recent developed vector lasers and microcavities could increase the dimensionality in a more compact way. However, it still remains a challenge to actively tune the diversified, high-dimensional superposition states of light on demand. Thus coherent generation of high-dimensional structured light, including spin-orbit states, does not seem to be practical for large-scale production.Solution:The current invention demonstrates a semiconductor micro laser exploiting spin-orbit coupling of light, wherein the polarization of the light becomes dependent on the on-chip direction of propagation, increasing the number of degrees of freedom by generating structured light states with unique polarization and phase properties. Two microcavities, coupled through a non-Hermitian synthetic gauge field, are designed to emit structured light states with six degrees of freedom using the spin-orbit coupling of light, allowing for a much larger amount of information to be encoded and processed.Technology:A hyperdimensional, spin-orbit microlaser for chip-scale flexible generation and manipulation of arbitrary four-level states, which uses integrated photonic circuits on the III/V semiconductor platform to emit spin-orbit states and uses an external laser to control the on-chip coupling, thereby coherently generating all the spin-orbit superposition states in the 4-dimensional Hilbert space. Tunable asymmetric couplings enabled by a synthetic imaginary gauge field provide flexible control of up to six degrees of freedom (DOFs), thus enabling the full coverage of a 4D Hilbert space. The vectorial state of the emitted laser beam in free space is mapped on a Bloch hypersphere defining an SU(4) symmetry, which demonstrates the dynamical generation and reconfiguration of high-dimensional superposition states with high fidelity.Advantages:Potential to further promote the precision limit in metrology, imaging, and information science.The carefully selected four spin-orbit-coupled states possess the same propagation properties and completely overlap in both space and time, thereby maintaining long-distance coherence, which is ideal for free-space quantum communication, including satellite-to-earth communication, tower to tower communication, and intracity communication.Space-division multiplexing can be used to transmit information with the use of the spin-orbit microlaser, increasing the channel capacity and the security of the communication channel.(a) The hyperdimensional microlaser, emitting in a 4D Hilbert space, consists of two same-sized microrings fabricated on a III-V semiconductor platform with 200 nm thick InGaAsP multiple quantum wells.

University of Pennsylvania,Small Molecule Activators of Valosin-Containing Protein (VCP) as Therapeutics for Neurodegenerative Diseases with Ubiquitinated Protein Aggregates,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/52431,"Small molecule therapeutics that aid in clearing abnormal protein deposits observed in neurodegenerative diseases.Problem:Dementia, characterized by the impairment of at least two brain functions, such as memory loss and judgment, currently has no cure. Two common neurodegenerative diseases that cause dementia are Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). In the United States, FTD affects an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 people, and AD, more than 6 million people. These diseases are characterized by the abnormal accumulation of protein aggregates, specifically tau and TDP-43 aggregates. Tau and TDP-43 proteins undergo abnormal folding and clump together into aggregates, which disrupt normal cellular function. Valosin-containing protein (VCP) is responsible for solubilizing and breaking down the tau and TDP-43 aggregates, preventing their accumulation, but pathogenic variants of VCP impair the breakdown of protein aggregates. Notably, other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Paget’s disease of bone, Parkinson’s Disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are also associated with pathogenic variants of VCP.Solution:The inventors identified four small molecules that allow pathogenic VCP to effectively unfold and degrade the insoluble aggregated forms of tau and TDP-43.Technology:VCP plays a role in protein quality control, and many ubiquitinated proteins (proteins tagged by ubiquitin for degradation) require pre-processing by VCP to be degraded by the proteasome. From a panel of approximately one hundred structurally distinct small molecules, the inventors discovered four compounds that increase VCP’s ATPase activity, allowing VCP to remove protein aggregates more efficiently.Advantages:VCP activity decreased tau filament aggregation by 30.1%.Small molecules increased VCP ATPase activity by more than 2 standard deviations from the mean and showed better clearing of protein aggregates.A schematic highlighting mechanisms that lead to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s Disease and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration. Soluble tau proteins aggregate to form fibrillar structures leading to disease. At the top right, wild-type VCP solubilizes and breaks down the problematic fibrillar tau.

Without proper treatment, the elevated pressure leads to heart failure and eventually death—median survival without treatment is around 2-3 years. Management and treatment of PAH may help slow down disease progression, but the mortality rate in patients with intermediate- to high-risk (approximately 88% of patient population) remains high.Solution:Molecular profiling and clinical studies have identified the loss of bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPR2) as a major contributor to PAH pathogenesis and progression. Increasing BMPR2 protein has been shown to effectively treat PAH in mouse models.Technology:Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are open reading frames found in the 5’ untranslated region of an mRNA, and they can control protein expression by modulating the rate of translation. Targeting certain regions of uORFs using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) has been shown to increase protein expression.

University of Pennsylvania,Transplantation of defined gut microbial consortia in the treatment of urease associated diseases,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/52310,"Problem:Urease is an enzyme found in human gut bacteria that hydrolyzes urea into ammonia. High levels of bacterial urease are associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Moreover, the increased ammonia resulting from urease activity can worsen symptoms for patients dealing with hyperammonemia – a condition associated with severe consequences such as brain edema, neurological impairment, liver dysfunction, and even death. Despite available treatments, managing IBD and hyperammonemia remains challenging as many patients develop treatment resistance.Solution:Bacterial urease levels found in the gut microbiota can be altered by engineering the gut microbiome. Here, the inventors identified a microbial consortium that has minimal urease activity.Technology :An altered Schaedler flora (ASF) with low urease activity was transplanted into conventional mice pretreated with antibiotics resulting in decreased urease activity and ammonia levels. Reduction of urease activity and ammonia was associated with reduced mortality and cognitive impairment in mice.

Decrease in number of these cells results in the clouding of the cornea that leads to vision loss. The standard of care for Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD) is corneal transplantation. However, in addition to the procedure being invasive and costly, there is an immense shortage of cornea donors (approximately 1 cornea available for 70 needed).Solution:Induce proliferation of corneal endothelial cells to reverse loss of cells using mRNA therapeutics delivered directly into the eye.Technology:Cells of the corneal endothelium do not proliferate to replenish their number, which causes a decline in cell density with age.

University of Pennsylvania,Shape Memory Polymer-Based Adhesive Gripper With High Conformability and High Load Capacity,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/51725,"Dry adhesion-based shape memory polymer (SMP) gripper with high-load capacity and a high adhesion switching ratio.Problem:Robotic arms that aim to grip and manipulate objects require grippers that can conform to flat and 3D objects while sustaining large loads. Friction-based robotic grippers can pick up 3D objects but merely flat objects and small objects. Furthermore, other adhesion-based grippers can only pick flat objects but not 3D objects. Even though there exist additional adhesion gripper designs that can grip 3D objects, their load capacity and/or adhesion switchability are not high enough.Solution:A dry adhesion-based gripper with a high adhesive load capacity that exploits an unstructured shape memory polymer (SMP) membrane with tunable stiffness, enabling rapid gripping and releasing of 3D objects. SMPs are known to be polymeric smart materials that have the ability to return from a deformed state to their original shape when triggered by an external stimulus. The stiffness of the shape memory polymer is managed by temperature control, wherein heating enables it to conform to an object’s shape while cooling stiffens the material and enables high load capacity.Technology:The inventors demonstrate a shape memory polymer (SMP)-based adhesive gripper with variable stiffness to pick and place 3D objects. Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are materials that can remember their original shape, stay in temporarily deformed shapes, and return to the original shape by an external stimulus, which makes them particularly useful in applications where flexibility and adaptability are important. The gripper is fabricated with an unstructured flat thermally responsive SMP membrane composed of two-part epoxy (EPON826 resin and Jeffamine D230 (poly (propylene glycol) bis (2-aminopropyl) ether curing agent. The SMP is connected to a flexible heater and a thermocouple attached to a heater used for measurement and control of the temperature.When the SMP is in a soft state, it is flexible and can conform to the shape of the object being picked up. This allows the gripper to make good contact with the object, which is important for achieving a strong adhesive bond. The soft state of the SMP also allows the gripper to conform to objects with irregular shapes or surfaces that might be difficult to pick up with a rigid gripper. Due to the variable stiffness of SMPs, once the SMP-based adhesive gripper has contacted the object, it can switch to a stiff state, which increases the adhesive load capacity of the gripper. This allows the gripper to hold the object securely, even if it is of a high load or has an irregular shape.Advantages:The SMP membrane is comprised of a material with low modulus in the soft state, as well as a membrane geometry with low axial and negligible bending stiffness, which makes it highly effective at adapting and conforming to nonplanar and deformable objectsUnstructured flat variable stiffness SMP membrane requires no microfabrication and can be manufactured via a simple casting processUnstructured flat variable stiffness SMP membrane enables the gripper to achieve a high load capacity and a high adhesion switching ratio, in comparison to gripper based on elastomer membranesSMP membrane exhibits no adhesion at rest, which prevents any unintended adhesionOnce the SMP membrane encounters an object and stiffens, it can passively maintain a high adhesion state without requiring continuous actuation. Soft robotic gripper offers better conformability and reduces the risk of object damage.Adhesion-based grippers can provide gripping forces that act both tangential and normal to a surfaceThe figure depicts the principle of operation of the SMP adhesive gripper. When not heated, the SMP membrane is stiff and cannot easily make conformal contact with other surfaces. During use, the SMP membrane is heated to 70oC to soften the SMP, then the membrane is contacted with the object. The contact forms by displacing the chamber supporting the SMP membrane to bring the membrane in contact with the object. While maintaining contact, the SMP membrane is cooled to 30oC.

University of Pennsylvania,Xenon Biosensors Improve Early Breast Cancer Detection,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/51718,"A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based enzyme-detection system comprising xenon (129Xe) biosensors complexed with an enzyme-specific peptide substrate.Problem:In 2023, about 298,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, with an estimated 43,700 deaths. Early cancer detection in the localized stage increases the five-year relative survival rate by up to 99%. Despite this, conventional methods are not highly effective in detecting cancer cells at an exceedingly early stage.Solution:129Xe biosensors offer an attractive alternative to conventional MRI methods due to their higher sensitivity and improved magnetic signal. Conjugating with respective substrates129Xe MRI contrast reagents allow more accurate detection of the activity of different enzymes in biological samples, including and not limited to early biomarkers of breast cancers such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Early detection is among the most promising approaches to reducing the growing cancer burden.Technology:The biosensor utilizes a hyperpolarized element129Xe, in complex with a cryptophane-A coupled peptide. The peptide is a substrate-specific to the target enzyme. As the enzyme interacts with the biosensor, it cleaves its substrate, causing electrostatic environment changes in the element.129Xe NMR spectroscopy can distinguish between the intact and cleaved biosensors with high sensitivity, enabling analysis of the chemical shift to indicate the activity of enzymes, including metalloproteinases for early breast cancer diagnosis.Advantages:Enables high-resolution, high-sensitivity detection of different early biomarkers of breast cancerWide chemical-shift window (> 200 ppm in water)Large signal (10-70% alignment of Xe nuclear spins compared to thermal polarization of 0.00027% at 37C and 3T)Simultaneous detection of different MMPs can help distinguish cancer cells from healthy cells more accuratelyAllows multiplexing using different cryptophanes to help identify aggressive tumor phenotypesStructure of an MMP-7- responsive129Xe biosensor.

University of Pennsylvania,"Non-Toxic, Potent Antimicrobial Peptides Derived From Wasp Venom For Use Against Antimicrobial Resistant (AMR) Pathogens",,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/51678,"Synthetic antimicrobial peptides derived from wasp venom to treat antibiotic-resistant infections.Problem:Antibiotics have transformed modern medicine as they are just one of the most effective drugs in history. However, the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) currently threatens to undermine these achievements, posing a major threat to public health. Millions of patients worldwide, including tens of thousands in the US, die each year from untreatable infections due to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance while the arsenal of effective drugs shrinks. As a result, the market for these drugs is set to grow 3-7% until 2030. Venoms represent an underexplored potential source of new antibiotics; however, they are limited by their toxicity.Solution:Here, rationally designed, synthetic variants of two natural or wild-type (WT) antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) found inEumenes micadowasp venom are non-toxic against human cell lines, active in anin vivomouse model, have enhanced antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, and a reduced propensity toward antibiotic resistance.Technology:Naturally occurring peptides found inEumenes micadowasp venom have antimicrobial properties. Through structure-function-guided design including alanine and lysine screening, the inventors developed synthetic variants of two WT AMPs from theEumenes micadowasp venom. Synthetic peptides with improved physicochemical properties such as net charge, helicity and amphiphilicity, were then subjected toin vitrotoxicity and antibiotic efficacy and resistance studies compared to the WT peptides and conventional antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and polymyxin B. Those synthetic peptides that were not selected for antibacterial resistance and had improved antimicrobial activity were also non-toxic and had potent bactericidal activity in a preclinical mouse model, which confirm their improved performancein vivo.Advantages:Reducedin vitroaggregation and increased amphiphilicity compared to the WT peptides, both of which are beneficial for manufacturing purposesNo development of antibiotic resistance inEscherichia coliover the course of a 20-day treatment compared to ciprofloxacin, whose minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) increased 1,000-fold over the same time courseNon-toxic at concentrations 4- to 8-fold above their therapeutic dose in primary human keratinocytes and no side effects or toxicityin vivo(indicated by no momentous change in the body weight of the treated mice compared to untreated mice)A 38- to 4,600-fold reduction inPseudomonas aeruginosaATCC strain PAO1 bacterial titer in mouse model of infection(A) A schematic describing the structure-function study design leading to second generation, synthetic peptides.

University of Pennsylvania,Synthetic Antibiotic Derived From Plasma Protein Human Apolipoprotein B Targets Key Pathogens in Hospital-Acquired Infections,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/51363,"Peptides derived from the human apolipoprotein B that are antimicrobial, anti-inﬂammatory, highly cytotoxic, and do not select for bacterial resistance.Problem:In 2019, more than 2.8 million people in the U.S. suﬀered from antibiotic-resistant infections, leading to over 35,000 deaths. Such infections are of great concern, especially for ESKAPE pathogens, which have growing resistance to commonly used antibiotics. It has been estimated that 10 million people would die each year from these untreatable diseases by the year 2050 at the present rate. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop alternatives to conventional antibiotics to treat drug-resistant infections.Solution:Four encrypted peptides that have been derived from human apolipoprotein B exhibit antimicrobial, anti-inﬂammatory, and highly cytotoxic properties. When combined, the peptides potentiated the activity of conventional antibiotics against bacteria and do not select for bacterial resistance. In addition, a retro-inverso variant of the lead encrypted peptide that is protease-resistant was produced and showed anti-infective efficacy in a mouse model.Technology:The inventors identified a class of encrypted peptides derived from the plasma protein human apolipoprotein B by using an algorithm developed by their group. Three ApoB-derived peptides were demonstrated to exhibit potent antimicrobial activity against drug-resistantKlebsiella pneumoniae,Acinetobacter baumannii,andStaphylococcibothin vitroand in an animal model. In addition, a protease-resistant variant was synthesized by reversing its peptide sequence, to avoid proteolytic degradation and ensure efficacy against common hospital-acquired infections.Advantages:The peptides were found to exert signiﬁcant antibacterial eﬀects (minimal inhibitory concentration ranging from 2.5−20 µmol L-1) against 5 key pathogenic genera implicated in hospital-acquired infections including Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas.(ri)-r(P)ApoBsProhas increased peptide stability as its antimicrobial activity remained constant after 16 h of preincubation in serum, while its parent peptide r(P)ApoBsProcompletely lost its activity upon incubation.(ri)-r(P)ApoBsProincreases the translational potential of its parent peptide without altering its antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities.The strategy of synthesizing a retro-inverso variant makes the molecules more suitable for future preclinical and clinical studies.When combining ApoB-derived encrypted peptides with conventional antibiotics, synergistic eﬀects were detected and the peptides potentiated the activity of conventional antibiotics against bacteria and do not select for bacterial resistance.Figure caption: (A) Antimicrobial activity of (ri)-r(P)ApoBsPro(µmol L-1) against seven bacterial strains.

The diagnosis can be devastating, and EP can be life-threatening. Up to 33% of pregnant women present with vague abdominal pain or bleeding symptoms in the first trimester and require a pelvic exam, blood tests, and ultrasounds to determine pregnancy status. Even after undergoing such tests, clinicians are unable to determine the status of early pregnancy for up to 40% of women.  Therefore, we need an improved method for detecting miscarriage and EP that is non-invasive and conclusive.Solution:The inventors developed a non-invasive diagnostic test to determine an early pregnancy's viability and location.  The test uses a panel of biomarkers to detect early pregnancy viability, location, or both. Biomarkers have cutoff thresholds to minimize false positives and false negatives. A multi-tiered algorithm maximizes sensitivity and specificity for each metric (viability and location). The results are combined to give a final pregnancy diagnosis.Advantages:Less invasive than the combination of pelvic exams, blood tests, and ultrasounds.Less time-consuming for healthcare professionals and patients.Assesses both miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy in one test.Maximizes accuracy, specificity and sensitivity for each condition.Stage of Development:Proof of ConceptIntellectual Property:PCT PendingReference Media:Bollig et al.J Assist Reprod Genet, 2023 Apr; 40(4): 837.Desired PartnershipsLicenseCo-developmentCase ID:19-8863-tpNCSWeb Published:6/7/2023Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/51309"
University of Pennsylvania,"Design Of Artificial Proteins As Ultrafast, Genetically Encoded Electrophysiological Reporters",,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/51306,"Problem:Recording neuronal activityin vivousing optical methods can help to distinguish between normal and diseased brains. An ideal electrophysiological sensor would have a customizable structure and mechanism, providing excellent spatial contrast while minimizing background noise. However, current genetically encoded protein-based voltage indicators (GEVIs) face two significant limitations. The first is slow temporal resolution due to structural reorganization during voltage sensing. The second is engineering constraints imposed on natural proteins, as protein engineering can lead to dramatic changes that compromise proper folding and the function of protein machines.Solution:To overcome the limitations of current GEVIs, researchers have proposed a new approach for creating next-generation sensors through rational design using non-biologically derived proteins from first principles. This approach is not limited by the constraints of modifying natural proteins, enabling the optimization of molecular content and biophysical mechanisms to achieve outstanding temporal resolution, sensitivity, and adaptability.Technology:The inventors used maquette technology to design GEVIs. Maquettes are rigid 4-helix bundle proteins that act as custom scaffolds for biological co-factors like fluorophores or redox sensors.  During voltage sensing, the fluorophore within maquette GEVIs provides an ultrafast fluorescence signal change independent of structural reorientation. The physical-chemical properties of GEVIs can be easily tuned by re-engineering the maquette without the risk of protein unfolding, as the starting maquette is stable and robust. Furthermore, this technology can be applied to other physiological reporters by changing the combination of cofactors anchored to the maquette.Advantages:High tolerance to sequence modification, redesign, and tuning of maquette functional propertiesA biosensing platform for different electrophysiological signalsUltrafast response with outstanding temporal resolution and sensitivityExpressable in mammalian cells(A) Transmembrane 4-helix bundle maquette with polar (cyan) and nonpolar regions (gray) using cysteine (yellow) to anchor a field-sensing biliverdin fluorophore (red).

An outstanding challenge remains to deliver the LNP and its mRNA cargo in a site-specific manner. Non-targeted delivery can compromise transfection and genome editing efficiency and result in off-target toxicity.Solution:Mitchell et al., developed a library of RGD-based LNPs whereby the RGD motif serves as a targeting ligand to direct the LNP to cells with cell-surface integrins, opening the potential for cancer cell targeting. The inventors have identified a lead candidate that demonstrates an improved safety profile and transfection efficiency compared to a non-targeted LNP.Technology:The technology comprises a library of novel RGD-based lipids and a method of synthesizing RGD-based LNPs.

Making commercially viable NK cell therapies requires large-scale production of NK cells which need to be cryopreserved for storage and transportation to the clinic. However, NK cells do not cryopreserve well; there is a significant loss of cells after cryopreservation, and those that survive are less functional. Poor recovery of NK cells after cryopreservation is a significant barrier to successful commercial development of NK cell therapies.Solution:Pre-treatment of NK cells with the cytokines, interleukin (IL)-15 & 18, under the correct conditions before cryopreservation enables a cryopreserved product of equipotency post thaw without recovery/restimulation in cytokine media.Technology:As cytokines play an essential role in the activation, development, and maturation of NK cells, it was hypothesized that pre-treating NK cells with different cytokines before cryopreservation might help improve NK cell recovery and function. The inventors discovered that NK cells with the pre-treatment of recombinant IL-15 & IL-18 prior to cryopreservation reduced autolysis of the NK cells and pre-treated NK cells maintained their cytotoxicity function post-thaw. In addition to patent rights covering methods of cytokine pre-treatment of NK cells prior to cryopreservation, the technology includes know-how related to cytokine suppliers, concentrations, order of addition and duration of pretreatment.Advantages:•    Enables an equipotent cryopreserved NK product.•    Enables the production, storage, and transportation of therapeutic doses of NK cells to the bedside.•    Leverages commercially-available sources of GMP-grade IL-15 & IL-18.B.Figure caption: (A) A bar graph showing NK cell loss after 24 hours thawing Cryopreserved NK cells.

A variety of methods have been developed to isolate mRNA from target cells to understand gene function; however, these methods lack the ability to effectively detect and compare nucleic acid molecules longitudinally, or among different cells or subcellular compartments. Further, the ability to effectively capture all RNA, not just the mRNA transcripts responsible for protein translation, remains elusive. There is a need for tunable compounds that can be multiplexed to detect the nucleic acid fingerprint of single cells in live and fixed tissue samples in diverse biological contexts.Solution:A “caged” molecule that is activated with near-UV or visible light with single-cell and high spatiotemporal resolution – “caged” molecules are those whose function is blocked until activated by specific stimuli, allowing for tunable activation. The molecule can capture and label RNA of interest in live and fixed tissue for longitudinal transcriptomic detection over time.Technology:Light is often employed as an external stimulus to control biological processes. “Caged” biomolecules that are blocked until activated by specific stimuli are useful for this application. These molecules activate with near-UV or visible light, which introduce few side reactions and allow for convenient modulation with high spatiotemporal resolution. The “caged” molecules described here, transcriptomein vivoanalysis (TIVA) and transcriptomein situanalysis (TISA)-tags, penetrate cells to isolate and label select RNAs through antisense oligonucleotide and ruthenium-based photolinker domains in a targeted manner.Advantages:“Caged” tags that can be activated with near-UV or visible light, introducing few aberrant reactions, and allowing for high-resolution modulation.Stimuli applied and removed noninvasively and directed at a precise time to a specific location with variable intensity, offering fine-tuning.The light stimulus does not interfere with most natural biological processes.The tags can be designed for multiplexed detection of various RNAs of interest or longitudinal detection of RNAs over time.The molecular tags offer single-cell resolution and can be used in fixed or live tissue, broadening their use and application.The molecular tags can capture and label microRNAs, lincRNAs, intron-containing RNAs, hnRNAS, in addition to poly-A+ mRNA and polyA-mRNA.Schematic of the TIVA tag – a multifunctional, caged RNA-capture molecule.

Intracellular delivery is the major challenge. Intracellular delivery requires ionizable lipids for mRNA delivery. In addition to this, these constituents of LNPs can affect the potency of the treatment.Solution:This invention demonstrates that cholesterol analogues such as Hydroxycholesterol incorporated into LNPs enhance mRNA delivery into T cells. In addition, an example of incorporating dexamethasone into the LNP formulation is shown to reduce inflammatory responses.Technology:Cholesterol analogues such as Hydroxycholesterol and Dexamethasone which has a structure similar to cholesterol, when incorporated into LNPs enhance the mRNA delivery into cells. The addition of hydroxyl groups to the cholesterol molecule can alter the cholesterol recycling mechanism exhibited by the endosome; and Dexamethasone having anti-inflammatory properties, reduces inflammation in cells which leads to higher expression of the payload mRNA, leading to greater potency of the treatment. A library of 24 LNPs was formulated using 6 X-hydroxycholesterol modifications (7𝛼, 7𝛽, 19, 20, 24, 25). Each of the 6 hydroxycholesterols were substituted in various ratios relative to unmodified cholesterol (12.5%, 25%, 50%, and 100% substitutions).Advantages:Hydroxycholesterol substitutions, particularly in the 7𝛼 position, at substitution ratios of 25% and 50%, demonstrate a statistically significant increase in delivery of mRNA to T cellsThe incorporation of hydroxycholesterols has an impact on the shape of LNPs when observed with TEM, suggesting that morphological changes may contribute to improved mRNA deliverySize, PDI, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency did not differ significantly between the particle formulations and S2, indicating that the incorporation of hydroxycholesterols allowed for LNP formationReduced inflammation and potentially fewer side effects with Dexamethasone than conventional LNPs1.5X expression of payload mRNA with Dexamethasone than conventional LNPsEngineering lipid nanoparticles (LNP) with hydroxycholesterol substitution: motivation, design, and synthesis.

In general, adhesives are either strong but irreversible or weak but reversible. There is a need for stronger and reversible adhesives. One potential solution is a formulation of poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and boric acid (BA), which is capable of high strength and reversible, but so far is limited by long drying time and susceptibility to water solvation.Solution:The current invention is a PVA/BA adhesive formulation that can quickly bond to surfaces with water after it has been prepared dry. This formulation is water-resistant at low volumes, and this resistance can be improved further by the addition of phenylboronic acid (PBA). Adhesion is reversed by rehydration without the addition of PBA.Technology:The present technology is a hydrogel formulation with dynamic covalent bonds using poly (vinyl alcohol) and boric acid. Both components are commercially available. The hydrogel is dried before use and activated with water. Hydration results in a softened surface that makes close contact with the surface.

Drug-resistant bacteria are also dangerous in secondary infections. These drug-resistant infections pose a large threat during global pandemics such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, there is a need for new and effective antibiotics. Toxins contained in venom have antibiotic potential, however these venoms are inherently toxic to humans.Solution:Modified wasp venom peptide has potent antibacterial activity while avoiding the toxicity of normal wasp venom. The modified peptide also reduces inflammation while activating an effective immune response to bacterial infection.Technology:The inventors searched a database of antimicrobial peptides to find common peptide sequences for activating the immune system. The peptide sequence attaches to wasp venom peptide. This peptide damages the outer membrane of bacteria, recruits immune cells that fight bacterial infections, and reduces inflammation. Since this peptide is still toxic to certain human cell types, the inventors further refined the added peptide sequence by swapping amino acids. The final modified peptide maintains the antibacterial properties of the initial peptide while eradicating its toxicity.Advantages:Permeabilizes outer membrane of bacteriaIncreases leukocyte recruitment to bacterial infectionDecreases inflammatory markers in response to bacterial infectionTreatment of mouse bacterial infections comparable to current standard-of-care antibiotics5-fold reduction in human cell toxicity with final refined peptideThe wasp venom protein, mast-L (green), modified with the addition of an engineered protein sequence (red), resulting in the mast-MO antibiotic protein.

Current approaches to create structures with desired curved surface often relies on soft and stretchable materials or by introduced cuts, which weaken the mechanical properties.

This surface is able to conform to complex shapes of arbitrary curvatures while maintaining lightweight and high mechanical strength.Technology:In traditional approaches, multiple cuts are necessary in order to transform a 2D sheet into a curved surface. However, each cut weakens the overall strength of the structure. This approach calculates pathways to cut and unfold a 3D curved surface from multiple 2D sheets while avoiding overlapping cuts on adjacent layers. This results in a strong, lightweight optimized structure with no self-overlapping.Advantages:Multi-layered structure designed with this approach withstood 40% larger load forces when compared to a randomized cutting schemeCan be used to conform to complicated surfaces without any folds or wrinklesAll existing algorithms on unfolding polyhedral mesh can be easily integrated into this approachThe figure shows various approaches to conforming 2D sheets towards 3D curved surfaces. A) Wrapping a flat sheet results in wrinkles. B) Kirigami patterns can prevent wrinkles but small hinges and uncovered regions limit the strength. C) Computational wrapping algorithm provides full coverage but overlapping cuts weaken the strength of the structure. D) This new approach which avoids cuts overlapping at the same position upon stacking, thus increasing strength.

Spherical caps have been widely used in the design of rapidly responsive soft robots, but the performance of the robots is restricted by the intrinsic properties of the caps, such as limited and often slow actuation speeds, requirement of complex control systems, and absence of sensing capabilities.Solution:A class of metacaps with rich nonlinear mechanical behaviors, which enable a variety of soft robotic systems with unprecedented functionalities, including a passive gripper with sensing capabilities that enable grasping of objects in 3.75 ms upon contact, a pneumatic actuated gripper with tunable actuation speeds to grasp objects of different mass and rigidity or softness (e.g. a strawberry vs. a plastic sphere), a swimming robot with amplified swimming speeds, and an untethered, electronics free-swimming robot with tunable actuation speeds.Technology:The inventors designed a metacap consisting of an array of ribs on a simple cap such that the bending stiffness of the cap can be fine-tuned locally. The finite element analyses revealed that metacaps showed a more pronounced snap-through behavior, i.e. the ability to turn inside-out due to a pneumatic, hydraulic, electric or magnetic trigger, as compared to other caps, and could achieve another equilibrium state after the occurrence of a snap, so called bistability, in contrast to simple spherical caps.Advantages:Greater energy storage and release than other caps as a result of the snap-through behaviorBistability: Metacap has two stable positions- undeformed and evertedMetacap enabled grippers are capable of grasping objects both passively and rapidly, and gently manipulating soft and delicate objects vs. rigid and strong onesMetacaps can be used to amplify the mechanical responses of other actuators for applications that require a high transient output power(A) Simple spherical caps with uniform thickness and clamped borders are typically monostable and are extremely sensitive to imperfections when the thickness to radius ratio is small, leading to limited energy release upon snapping. (B) Even though increasing the thickness to radius ratio can make the caps more robust, the large thickness would compromise snapping behavior. (C) The inventors designed a metacap by introducing an array of ribs to a simple cap aligned in the circumferential and radial directions, which gives rise to rich nonlinear mechanical properties and enables a variety of soft robotic systems with unprecedented functionalities.Stage of Development:Proof of ConceptIntellectual Property:U.S. Provisional Application FiledReference Media:Yang et. al, 2022, Ultra-fast, programmable, and electronics-free soft robots enabled by snapping metacaps,arXivDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:23-10190-tpNCSWeb Published:5/12/2023Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/51019"

This range is not enough to carry large weights greater than 50kgs.Solution:The current invention reports ultrastrong hydrogel patches made from poly(hydroxyethylmethacrylate) (PHEMA) that exhibit one order of magnitude higher adhesive strength of up to 892 N/m2in the dry state and yet can be rendered reversible by moisturizing the patch with water to release it effortlessly. The hydrogel system can change its elastic modulus from 200kPa (in the wet state) to a few GPa (in the dry state), which helps in “locking” the patch to the target.Technology:This invention was inspired by the epiphragm of snails, that is by the drying of the mucus that helps lock shells to targets. This PHEMA hydrogel system can change its elastic modulus from 200kPa (in the wet state) to GPa (in the dry state). When the wet gel patch is loaded onto the target, the softened gel conforms to the target and make a good contact. Upon drying, its modulus increases significantly while remaining to be conformally contacted with the target such that it gets “locked” to the rough surface, leading to a high pull-off strength of 223N and 1058N with 0.25 cm2and 2 cm2, respectively. When rewet, the patch is softened again, the adhesion stress is released and the patch is peeled off easily.Advantages:The hydrogel system can change its elastic modulus from 200kPa (in the wet state) to a few GPa (in the dry state), which helps in “locking” the patch to the target conformallyProduces a high pull-off strength of 223N and 1058N with patch area of 0.25 cm2and 2 cm2, respectivelyWhen rewet, the patch is softened, the adhesion stress is released and the patch is peeled off easily, hence is reversibleUltrastrong patches that exhibit one order of magnitude higher adhesive strength of up to 892 N/m2, comparable or superior than that of the superglue, which is a liquid based adhesiveCan carry large weights of greater than 50kgsThe patch can be reusableA)  Epiphragm of snail demonstrating interlocking with rough surfaces; B)  Chemical structure of PHEMA; C) Advantages of PHEMA adhesivesStage of Development:ConceptProof of ConceptBench PrototypeIntellectual Property:U.S. Patent Application FiledReference Media:H.

Unfortunately, modern sensors use hard materials like silicon and metal which break after strains of just 3% and require adhesives for medical applications. These materials also require electrolytic gels to reduce impedance, leading to long-term breakdown and skin irritation. In addition, hard materials are difficult to miniaturize for next-generation implantable technologies, such as deep brain stimulators, which can treat neurological disorders like Parkinson’s Disease.Solution:The research team combined the biocompatibility and flexibility of hydrogels with the high conductivity found in two-dimensional MXenes and other conductors to create a naturally flexible and adhesive electrode. This device easily contours and adheres to the human form while maintaining high conductivity and low impedance.Technology:First, a base hydrogel comprising polyvinyl alcohol, boronic acid and chitosan is created. It is then mixed in a conductive filler made of carbon nanotubes, reduced graphene oxide, PEDOT:PSS, or two-dimensional MXenes with up to 5 wt%.  The conductive hydrogel mix can achieve DC conductivities ranging over three orders of magnitude depending simply on the loading percentage and conductive filler type. Preliminary tests on skin also show lower impedance than commercial 3M 2360 adhesive electrodes.Advantages:DC conductivity up to 500 mS/cm at 5 wt% MXene loading, more than two orders of magnitude larger than the conductivity of water.Fine-tunable conductivity between 10 and 1000 mS/cm achievable with varying composition of reduced graphene oxide, PEDOT:PSS, MXene, carbon nanotube, salts, and antioxidants.Stage of Development:Proof of ConceptIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Driscoll et al.Curr Opin Biotechnol, 2021 Dec, 72 : 76Driscoll et al.Sci.

University of Pennsylvania,Cloud-Based Machine Learning Platform for Real-Time Clinical Image Analysis,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/51023,"A cloud-based machine learning platform accessible by clinicians for real-time image analysis supporting multiple machine learning algorithms.Problem:Recent developments in deep-learning algorithms have led to a rapid rise in the use of machine learning for diagnostic image analysis. This application of machine learning and artificial intelligence has the potential to save radiologists time, reduce costs, and improve diagnostic accuracy.  Ideally, the AI solution should be available on a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) before a radiologist reads the study, to mitigate potential report addendums. However, most PACS systems cannot execute computationally-intensive AI algorithms and specialized hardware for on-site image processing can be cost-prohibitive.Solution:The inventors developed a medical image processing pipeline for real-time clinical use. Because the pipeline hosts machine learning algorithms on a cloud server, clinical PACS systems can access these algorithms for real-time image processing of newly-acquired patient data. This tool improves diagnostic accuracy and saves radiologists’ time without needing to alter existing workflows. Furthermore, the platform flexibly supports multiple machine learning algorithms, giving additional diagnostic options for clinicians.Technology:The invention has two primary components. The first component is a medical image analysis platform hosted on a cloud-based server that scrapes medical text and protected health information (PHI) from uploaded images. The platform stores PHI on a PHI-compliant server and sends the de-identified images to a separate cloud server to test different machine learning algorithms and generate clinical predictions. The invention's second component is custom software that smoothly integrates the machine learning predictions with relevant data fields in the radiologist’s patient report. This smooth integration provides the clinician directly with additional diagnostic information.Advantages:Platform can run in parallel with current radiology workflows without any changes to existing PACS systemsClinicians receive near real-time predictions of diagnostic images which are integrated into patient reportsPlatform supports multiple machine learning algorithms and tools for image analysisNo need for cost-prohibitive specialized machine learning hardwareSchematic of the cloud-based medical image analysis platform.Stage of Development:Minimum Viable ProductPilot Project UnderwayIntellectual Property:Provisional Patent FiledReference Media:Radiology Business Journal’s 3rdAnnual Innovation AwardDesired Partnerships:LicenseCase ID:22-9780-tpNCSWeb Published:5/12/2023Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/51023"

For example, image processing algorithms are important for self-driving cars, which need to be trained on many different types of images. In addition, in certain models some tasks conflict with one another resulting in less accuracy due to the competition among the dissonant tasks.Solution:Model Zoo is a boosting-based algorithm built on many smaller algorithms. As a result of this method, higher accuracy is obtained as compared to the accuracy obtained when multiple data sets are fitted to one algorithm. Furthermore, this method requires less data for training and allows for training on tasks whose accuracy may compete with other tasks, without compromising accuracy.Technology:The inventors utilize multiple models together in a way that increases the power of the whole system without compromising the accuracy of each independent model. The resulting algorithm combines many small models trained on specific tasks. It selectively uses relevant tasks while filtering out tasks where there is a negative or no statistical benefit to their inclusion.Advantages:Thoroughly tested on image classification benchmarksImproved accuracy over state of the art algorithmsOutperforms five tested algorithmsDecreased training cost for large datasetsFigure shows the training of similar tasks together, for example, training Model 1 for P1 using learning from P2, P5, and P6.

Moreover, these technologies allow control over the amplitude or phase of light, but not both.Solution:The current invention offers a reflective display that reduces power consumption and increases resolution while making the device easier to operate outdoors. Since each optical resonator is individually addressable, both phase and amplitude can be controlled.Technology:The invention consists of a series of optical cavities, each with a bottom layer of silicon mirror and a top film of Platinum (Pt) that is partially reflective. The two layers are separated by a thin gap typically filled with water. The top layer can be tuned using a voltage that causes the layer to expand and subsequently alter its spectral reflectance. Incident light is reflected by the bottom mirror and partially by the top layer, which is further split by the bottom mirror, forming an optical resonator. The thickness of the top layer, as controlled by the voltage, determines the wavelength of light reflected by the optical resonator.Advantages:The device requires a power source of less than 1V (estimated 0.2V), so it would use less power and extend battery life over current display technologiesIncreased resolution with pixel size 1-10 microns, well below the resolution limit of human vision, compared to 10-100 microns pixel size of current display technologyEach pixel can operate within voltage range (~1V) and switch at speed upwards of 100msecThe device is manufactured using atomic layer deposition, which decreases the size of each pixel.

Such machines are promising for industrial manufacturing, exploratory, and medical applications. For instance, engineers have created soft robotic gloves that assist the human grip, octopus-shaped swimmers that navigate tight spaces underwater, and even tiny crawling robots that can deliver drugs inside the human body. Current designs for soft robots incorporate sensors and actuators made from hard electronic materials, limiting their flexibility and possibilities for miniaturization.Solution:This technology is a soft robot designed with zero hard electronics-based actuators or sensors. The robot is outfitted with  multiple soft modular control units that enable decision-making in diverse environments. This enables superior flexibility and potential for miniaturization, as no traditional electronics are needed.Technology:Soft robots unlock their full potential when their components are as flexible as possible. Guided by this principle, the authors developed a clever soft robot design incorporating kirigami – the traditional Japanese art of folding and cutting paper – to control the robot’s moving direction. Their design uses an inflatable silicone actuator to drive kirigami expansion, which powers locomotion through angled feet. Materials responsive to heat, light, or chemicals like liquid crystal elastomers or hydrogels activate control modules within the kirigami to sense and pilot the robot, all with zero electronics.Advantages:Zero hard electronic materialsSensitive to heat, light, or chemical changesBending angle up to 30 degreesOperates at temperatures up to 150°CDecision-making capabilities by constructing logic gates using sensing modulesDesign of the electronics-free soft autonomous robot.

University of Pennsylvania,Ionizable Lipid Nanoparticles For In Vivo mRNA Delivery To The Placenta During Pregnancy,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/51146,"Lipid nanoparticles for selective mRNA delivery to the placenta to treat pre-eclampsia, FGR, and other pregnancy-related disorders.Problem:3-8% of pregnant women experience pre-eclampsia, or insufficient blood flow to the placenta. In severe cases, this can cause fetal growth restriction (FGR), in which the developing fetus cannot receive adequate blood flow.  The only curative option for pre-eclampsia and FGR is to deliver the fetus regardless of gestational age. Because of this, pre-eclampsia and FGR are the leading causes of premature and stillbirths.Several groups have developed gene therapies to try to address pre-eclampsia and FGR. However, these viral-based approaches have the potential for permanent off-target effects in other organs and must be delivered directly into the placenta via an invasive uterine injection.Solution:The inventors identified a lipid nanoparticle composition to deliver mRNA-based therapeutics to the placenta effectively. mRNA-based therapies are safer than viral alternatives as they last for a shorter time inside the body. The mRNA lipid nanoparticles can be loaded with mRNAs to treat pre-eclampsia, FGR, or other pregnancy-related disorders. They can be delivered through a regular IV without requiring invasive actions.Technology:The inventors designed and screened a library of 15 lipid nanoparticle compositions for their ability to deliver mRNA to placental cells. They then tested the lead compositions for their ability to target the uterus and placenta in mice. The lead LNP (A4) showed enhanced delivery to the placenta compared to an industry-standard LNP. Importantly, the LNPs delivered mRNA to the placenta, but not the fetuses, suggesting this therapy is safe for placental targeting.The inventors then delivered VEGF mRNA, a vascular growth factor known to stimulate blood flow, via LNPs. The A4 LNP increased fetal blood vessel dilation, indicating on-target VEGF delivery.Advantages:LNPs are delivered by IV, which is less invasive than the intrauterine injections used to deliver viral therapiesmRNA-based therapies have fewer long-term risks than viral-based therapiesThe A4 LNP delivers more mRNA (62%) to the placenta than the industry standard LNP (34%)The A4 LNP delivers mRNA to the placenta but not the fetuses, suggesting fetal safetyThe A4 LNP delivers mRNA to more of the relevant cells (3.1%) than the industry standard LNP (1.7%)The A4 LNP shows a lower potential for liver toxicity than the industry standard LNP. (The industry standard shows 8.7-fold higher expression of a marker of liver toxicity than A4)LNP delivery shows no signs of causing placental inflammationThe A4 LNP specifically increases fetal blood vessel dilation, while the industry standard LNP increases maternal blood vessel dilation.

The method is particularly suited for situations where high resolution imaging using MRI, CT, or PET is not clinically feasible. This method produces significantly better performance in terms of superior image quality, greater quantitative-measurement accuracy, and low bias compared to other methods using convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks (GAN).

One of the biggest challenge in developing a successful RNA therapies is its targeted delivery. Typically, LNPs require targeting ligands to be coated onto their surface to enable targeted delivery after the lipid is made. This added step often complicates the fabrication process.Solution:Rather than functionalizing LNPs with targeting ligands post-fabrication, this technology incorporates targeting capabilities directly into the lipid component to create ligand-thethered LNPs. This creates an affinity to the notoriously hard-to-target activated fibroblasts in the liver responsible for the buildup of collagen.Technology:The method incorporates small targeting moieties into the ionizable lipid which enable the generation of ligand-tethered LNPs. The lead AA-lipidoid AA-T3A-C12 mediates greater RNA delivery and transfection of activated fibroblasts than its analog without anisamide and the FDA-approved MC3 ionizable lipid. In a preclinical model of liver fibrosis, AA-T3A-C12 enables ~65% silencing of heat shock protein 47, a therapeutic target primarily expressed by activated fibroblasts, which is 2-fold more potent than MC3, leading to significantly reduced collagen deposition and liver fibrosis.Advantages:Enables targeted LNP creation without the need for post-fabrication processesCan be used to deliver genetic medicines such as mRNA and siRNA therapiesIncreased selectivity and ability to target liver fibroblasts(a) Formulation of AA-T3A-C12/siHSP47 LNP via microfluidic mixing.

This can be problematic when patients stop breathing or are slow to wake from sedation.Solution:The inventors developed a library of compounds that antagonize the effects of propofol.

Children with MPS suffer from a suite of variable and severe symptoms including respiratory/cardiac deficits, and commonly synovial joint skeletal abnormalities. There are no known specific biomarkers used to track MPS patients at risk for joint complications and with the potential to be responsive to earlier intervention.Solution:The inventors used a canine model of MPS I, and obtained serum and synovial fluid samples to identify 10 significant and highly predictive biomarkers.Technology:To identify candidate proteins that are altered early in MPS I, the inventors took joint fluid and blood from canines aged 1 years old. Hundreds of proteins were assayed simultaneously using tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

University of Pennsylvania,Machine learning device for quickly identifying tissue malignancy during live surgery,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/48541,"Machine learning device for quickly identifying tissue malignancy during live surgery.Problem:When a patient presents with potentially malignant pulmonary tissue via pre-operative imaging, surgery and early removal of the cancerous tissue is their best avenue for treatment. However, when proceeding with the operation, the surgeon must remove a diagnostic resection of the lesion and wait for the pathology department to confirm the presence of cancer, a process that adds up to 35 minutes to the procedure. Recent developments in endomicroscopy provide cellular resolution imaging that allows for the classification of tissues without the need for lengthy diagnostic tests, but the interpretation of such visual data requires extensive training for operators.Solution:The inventors developed a machine learning methos that assesses the potential malignancy of tumor cells in real-time in the operating room. The device only takes a few seconds to perform classification and evaluates the 3D structure of the tumor. Furthermore, it also indicates any potential sampling errors to further lower the risk of user error.Technology:Near-infrared needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (NIR-nCLE) is an imaging method providing cellular level resolution of potential tumors. The inventors used NIR-nCLE combined with an NIR contrast imaging agent to build a high-fidelity training set with over 1500 videos and trained a convolutional neural network to identify malignant tissues.Advantages:Predicts malignancy of tissue with >93.5% accuracyPerforms prediction on single-cell nCLE imaging in real timeInforms operator if tissue sampling is adequateDevice can be tailored for cloud-based remote lesion assessmentStage of Development:Bench PrototypeIntellectual Property:Provisional FiledReference Media:Newton et al.;J Thorac Dis., 2016, 8:S697-S704.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:22-10041-tpNCSWeb Published:10/3/2022Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/48541"
University of Pennsylvania,Manipulation of the microenvironment to increase the number of functional cells in kidney organoids,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/48091,"Problem:Kidney organoids are masses of kidney cells grown in a lab for medical and research purposes to mimic kidney functions. With further development, doctors could use kidney organoids and engineered tissues in transplant settings to replace the need for human donors. A major roadblock in this technology is achieving enough differentiated nephrons (functional cells) to allow the organoid to act as a functioning kidney. Normally in kidney development, multiple rounds of nephron differentiation result in hundreds of nephrons. However, organoids currently undergo only one round of differentiation, limiting their current usefulness for research and medicine.Solution:The inventors noted that, in normal kidney development, the growth and branching of the developing ureter tubes apply pressure to the organ's cells in cyclic rounds, and this pressure is required to differentiate them into nephrons. Therefore, the inventors developed a method to mimic these rounds of cellular tension to increase the number of differentiated nephrons in the organoid.Technology:The inventors identified the crucial role of cellular tension in nephron development in vivo. By adding inhibitors that block the cell's ability to sense tension, the inventors mimic these cyclical tension changes to generate kidney organoids with increased numbers of differentiating nephrons. Using these inhibitors, the inventors see a 2-10 times increase in differentiating nephron cells in kidney organoids.Advantages:ROCK inhibition yields kidney organoids that have 2-10 times higher levels of LHX1 (a nephron marker) and two times higher levels of Six2 (a marker of cells transitioning into nephrons) than organoids grown without manipulation of cellular tension.Non-muscle myosin inhibition yields kidney organoids with two times higher levels of LHX1 than organoids grown without manipulation of cellular tension.Both ROCK and non-muscle myosin inhibitors are commonly used and accessible reagents allowing easy adoption into culturing protocols.(Images of kidney organoids grown in various conditions. Cyan indicates LHX1, a marker of early-stage nephrons, and magenta indicates SIX2, a marker of cells transitioning into nephrons. Levels of LHX1 and SIX2 are quantified in the plots to the right. Combinatorial treatment of organoid growth factor (CHIR) and ROCK inhibition (Y-27632) yields 2-10 fold higher LHX1 and two-fold higher SIX2, suggesting increased nephron yield.

Unfortunately, existing technologies are hampered by their sensitivity, often requiring specific substrates and operating environments. Two-dimensional materials like transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have highly desirable optical and electronic properties for such applications, but offer uneven sample thickness, small lateral dimensions, and weak light absorption.Solution:The researchers developed a method to create semiconductor-TMD superlattices. These superlattices offer controllable thickness, device-scale lateral size, and strong light absorption. In addition, they maintain the quantum effects found in TMD monolayers such as exciton-polariton splitting. This introduces exciting avenues for optical device engineering.Technology:TMDs offer an excellent platform for optical devices due to their direct bandgap, strong quantum confinement, and nonradiative exciton-hole energy loss. The authors were inspired by these benefits to devise a method to harness TMDs’ upsides while mitigating the downsides of sample preparation and geometry. They accomplished this by stacking TMDs and thin semiconductors together using a wet chemical transfer process. This stabilizes the TMDs and enables quantum device designs on the order of square centimeters.Advantages:Method creates samples on the order of 1 cm2 for real-world device applicationsSuperlattices exhibit over 80% light absorption at TMD excitonic frequencyPreserves quantum effects of the monolayer TMDs, including exciton-polariton Rabi splitting up to 170 meVCavity mode quality factor as large as 300Operates at room temperatureStructure of a superlattice combining 2D TMD sheets with nanometer-scale semiconductor slabs.

One unit operation that remains underdeveloped in droplet microfluidics is the exchange of fluid through droplets in a continuous flow, high-throughput modality. Current technologies in this space include either a pico-injection, which adds a buffer to droplets that are then split into two, or the transfer of one droplet content into another. These approaches do not necessarily remove fluid from the droplets and are limited to approximately 100-fold dilutions at a throughput of 100Hz (100 droplets per second).Solution:A droplet unit operation with innovative fabrication, design, and quantification that increases throughput 10-fold to 1KHz, and simultaneously exchanges fluid from droplets in flow with high efficiency.Technology:The pico-washer's specific design geometry and operational parameters lend themselves to a stable and efficient fluid exchange. The moving droplet makes contact with a high-pressure wash and a low-pressure waste stream in the presence of an electric field, which facilitates the fluid transfer.Advantages:1KHz throughput, a 10-fold increase compared to current technologiesThe cross-flow design exchanges (as opposed to adds) material  through droplets in continuous flowThe ability to scale parallelized arrays of pico-washers, each with KHz throughput, could collectively realize MHz throughputsCompatible with existing droplet microfluidic technology to efficiently achieve  multi-step high-throughput droplet biological and chemical assaysSchematic of the various fluidic channels in the droplet generator and pico-washer (highlighted in red): a high-pressure (PH) wash stream, low-pressure (PL) waste stream, continuous oil (PC), and dispersed aqueous (PD) stream.

This highly successful procedure uses an inert near-infrared dye to discern tumors from healthy cells. However, every potential tumor must be checked by an oncologist. This step adds upwards of 30 minutes and costs thousands of dollars per potential tumor.Solution:The authors developed OptiDX, a smart camera powered by AI to evaluate tumor fluorescence in real time. This tool provides immediate and accurate tumor identification without the frozen section staining process normally required.Technology:Fluorescence-guided methods are powerful tools to identify tumors as small as 2mm in length. The diversity of shapes, sizes, and intensities among differing health populations makes direct fluorescence evaluation difficult. Thus, the authors employed deep learning and computer vision toolkits to predict cancer probability from fluorescence, demographic, and co-morbidity data.Advantages:Identifies tumors immediately, saving over 30 minutes and thousands of dollars per tumor per operation.Requires energies under 0.1 eV, significantly lower than the operating room lights.Reliable and consistent algorithm eliminates observer bias.Area under receiver-operating curve is 0.897, close to a perfect score of 1.0, indicating few false positives and false negatives.Intuitive and easy to useStage of Development:ConceptIntellectual Property:Patent Application In ProcessReference Media:Singhal, SunilJAMA Surg., 2016 Feb, 151 (2) : 184Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:21-9623-tpNCSWeb Published:5/12/2023Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/51036"

For this reason, therapies that are delivered to the fetus before birth hold promise to treat diseases prior to or in the early stages of pathology and reduce disease burden, morbidity, and mortality. Viral vectors can deliver nucleic acids to the fetus for prenatal protein and enzyme replacement; however, they have limitations regarding immunogenicity, genomic integration, and repeat dosing. Non-viral nucleic acid delivery methods avoid these risks yet face challenges with rapid nucleic acid degradation and hindered transport into cells.Solution:A lipid nanoparticle nucleic acid delivery system was developed that remains stable upon delivery in utero and potently delivers nucleic acid material intracellularly, providing robust protection and delivery of cargo to fetal tissues in contact with amniotic fluid.Technology:Ionizable lipid nanoparticles are made by mixing ionizable lipid B-4, cholesterol, DOPE, and PEG2000 with an aqueous phase containing messenger RNA (mRNA). Both phases are mixed at controlled flow rates in a microfluidic device to generate the mRNA-loaded nanoparticles. The mRNA is tailored to encode for the protein/enzyme of interest required in the fetal tissue.  After screening for stability and potency in amniotic fluid, selected nanoparticles are delivered in utero through controlled injection into the amniotic sac.Advantages:Prevents off-target mutations by not integrating with genomic DNAStable in amniotic fluid (from. mouse, sheep, pig, and human)Enhanced cellular uptake for potent intracellular delivery of therapeutic cargoAchieves nucleic acid delivery in fetal lungs, intestines, liver, and other tissues in direct contact with amniotic fluidOverview of LNP library design, formulation, and ex utero screening in amniotic fluids to predict intra-amniotic delivery. A library of 16 LNP formulations was generated using orthogonal design of experiments (DOE) to explore four molar ratios of each of four excipients. Next, each LNP was synthesized by combining an ethanol phase of lipid excipients – including ionizable lipid, DOPE phospholipid, cholesterol, and lipid-PEG – with an aqueous phase containing luciferase mRNA.

Their simple non-toxic composition along with their non-rigid structure allows the material to easily conform to the human body. Hydrogels, however, could have poor stretchability, weak adhesion (especially when wet), and limited self-healing mechanisms. This prevents their use in spaces like the cranial cavity, where electronic signals could be administered to treat seizures.Technology:First, polyvinyl alcohol is dissolved in a buffer solution. Then, boronic acid and optional chitosan is added, resulting in a thick hydrogel. Additives like dyes or conductive MXene sheets can be added for extra functionality such as increased electric conductivity. The dynamic boronic ester bonds enable bond exchanges which promote high strength and fast healing at defect sites.

University of Pennsylvania,"Simple Polymer Mesogen to Create Stable Nanoporous Crystals for Filtration, Catalysis, and Ion Transport",,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/51038,"A polymer mesogen which self-assembles into a stable cubic nanoporous liquid crystal, for use in filtration, catalysis, and ion transport.Problem:Cubic nanoporous liquid crystals (CNLCs) are ordered materials with nanoscale holes created using polymers called mesogens. CNLCs hold extraordinary promise in nanoscale filtration, with obvious applications in filtering salt or organic solvents from water. CNLCs also have catalytic applications, such as hosting Bronsted acid sites in petroleum hydrocracking. Further, CNLCs offer highly selective, temperature-independent lithium ion conductivity in liquid electrolyte batteries. Unfortunately, CNLCs require complicated mesogens and are often unstable. This severely limits their commercial and industrial applicability. Achieving robust molecular selectivity in harsh operating environments holds the key to unlocking the next generation of these wide-ranging technologies.Solution:The authors created a simple single-head/single-tail polymer mesogen that can assemble into stable CNLCs. This mesogen is easy to manufacture, cross-links itself upon UV light exposure, and creates CNLCs that are stable when exposed to heat, water, acids, and bases. This requires no co-monomers or cross-linkers, unlike prior single-head/single-tail monomer systems.Technology:Previous CNLC mesogen designs incorporated a single-head/single-tail structure which was straightforward to produce, but required complicated chemical stabilizers and crosslinkers to form a CNLC. This technology leverages a polymerizable methacrylamide group near the single ionic headgroup and a polymerizable diene group in the single hydrophobic tail. This mesogen can self-crosslink with a simple photoinitator and UV light and remains stable to elevated temperatures and submersion in water, acids, and bases for extended periods.Advantages:Mesogen assembles stable CNLC with nanoscale gaps of size 1.5 nmSimple single-head, single-tail design takes just 3 hours to crosslink – significantly shorter than other CNLC methods which process overnightPressure-driven filtration of vitamin B12 attains 98% solute rejection, indicating strong potential in organic solvent filtrationCaptures 90% of negatively charged molecules with size 0.7 nm but 0% of negatively charged molecules with size 1.9 nm, exhibiting robust size selectivity for ion transportationStable up to temperatures of at least 210°C and upon exposure to 1N NaOH or 1N HCl for 96 hoursThe mesogen designed by the authors includes a polymerizable methacrylamide group near an ionic headgroup and a polymerizable diene group in a hydrophobic tail.

University of Pennsylvania,Controlled Levitation of Nanostructured Thin Films for Sun-Powered Near-Space Flight,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/51039,"Levitation of polymer nanocomposite film upon illumination in upper atmospheric conditions.Problem:Airborne objects cannot sustain flight within the mesosphere, the upper layer of the Earth’s atmosphere. This layer, which resides 50-80km above the Earth’s surface, lacks the air density needed for airplane lift yet is too dense for satellite orbit. While unoccupied by airborne objects, the mesosphere is a critical resource for surveillance and climate research. Therefore, the ability to sustain flight in the mesosphere is needed for atmospheric data collection and airspace monitoring.Solution:The microscale disks can levitate with illumination. This levitation is sustained under mesospheric pressures and light intensities. The direction of incident light does not affect levitation, allowing for these disks’ real-world applications within the Earth’s atmosphere. These disks may withstand micro-payloads such as weather sensors that collect atmospheric data.Technology:Photophoresis uses light to displace gas or liquid particles. This particle movement can result in propulsive forces that lift objects. This photophoretic lifting force is often driven by temperature gradients between the top and bottom of an object. However, this force can also originate from varied surface topologies of an object’s top and bottom surfaces. The inventors leverage this phenomenon by creating mylar disks of submicron thickness. The bottoms of these disks are coated in carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Upon illumination, these CNT networks trap air molecules, which collide with multiple surfaces before escaping with higher velocity. This difference in molecule velocity creates a lifting force that levitates the ultrathin disks.Advantages:Disk levitates under 0.5 W/cm2 incident light intensity, comparable to natural sunlightLevitation achieved under ~10 Pa pressure, comparable to mesospheric pressuresDisk levitation can be controlled and “trapped” by casting rings of higher light intensityDisks may withstand up to 10 mg payloadOverview of disk and levitating mechanism (A) Schematic of disk surface topology and propulsive force mechanism. While air molecules have single collisions with the disk’s smooth top surface, the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) coating the bottom surface trap incoming air molecules.

High pressure in the eye can lead to optic nerve damage, which can progress to permanent vision loss. For this reason, reduction of intraocular pressure is the main therapeutic mechanism available. Unfortunately, glaucoma can continue to progress even in patients with normalized intraocular pressure. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of new therapeutic approaches with distinct mechanistic targets that prevent vision loss in glaucoma patients.Solution:Targeting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1-R) prevents the cellular death responsible for vision loss in glaucoma. Even in cases where intraocular pressure remains elevated, the therapeutic is able to improve the survival of cells required for vision.Technology:Pro-inflammatory astrocytes in glaucoma contributes to the death of retinal ganglion cells, which make up the optic nerve and are required for vision. Reduction of intraocular pressure does not prevent activation of these astrocytes. Investigators identified that targeting GLP1-R in a mouse model of glaucoma reduces ocular inflammation and prevents the damaging effects of these astrocytes, thereby rescuing retinal ganglion cells.Advantages:Reduces expression of pro-inflammatory factors in resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages (IL-1a, TNF-a, C1q)Improves retinal ganglion cell survival in environment of elevated intraocular pressure (~25% after 42 days in mouse model of glaucoma)Stage of Development:In vivo proof of conceptIntellectual Property:US PatentpendingReference Media:Sterling, J et al.Cell Rep, 2020 Nov 3, 33(5): 108271Sterling, J et al.Br J Ophthalmol, 2023 Feb; 107(2): 215Desired PartnershipsLicenseCo-developmentCase ID:20-9435-tpNCSWeb Published:5/12/2023Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/51048"

Vertebral fractures attributed to poor bone quality (e.g., osteoporosis) are a major medical concern that may require surgical treatment and often result in physical disability. Unfortunately, use of medical imaging leads to detection of only one third of vertebral deformities/fractures as vertebral measurements are generally obtained by radiologists and orthopaedic surgeons by manual annotation of vertebrae. Patients undergoing spine surgeries or those at risk for osteoporosis could benefit from state-of-the-art spine health analysis.Technology Overview:The invention is an automated, neural network used for analysis of the vertebral bodies on spine MR, CT, PET, or X-ray imaging.

The global medical electrode market is currently valued at over $1B and continues to grow in response to new applications for these devices. Solutions-based processing methods are limited by a lack of conductive and biocompatible inks, making it difficult to produce electrodes with the same performance quality as metallic electrodes.

If left unchecked DSP progresses, resulting in gait instability, falls, and can even lead to amputation. Current treatments are limited, consisting of either pain medication or biofeedback devices to alleviate sensory loss. No individual therapeutic addresses both pain and sensory issues simultaneously. To further complicate matters, all current methods suffer from lack of patient compliance (as low as 36%).Solution:In response, the inventors developed a nerve stimulation device that treats both pain and loss of feeling. In addition, as an implantable device there are no compliance issues.Technology Overview:The inventors designed a minimally invasive implantable system to activate nerves in the leg in response to pressure on of the foot. The device is composed of two implantable components: a pressure sensor implanted under the skin on the bottom of the foot, and a battery-powered base unit implanted in the thigh connected to the leg nerves. When the foot sensors detect pressure, they wirelessly transmit signals to the base unit to provide nerve stimulation as therapy.Advantages:Treats both the pain and loss of feeling associated with DPS simultaneously, unlike current treatments which target each concern separatelyImplant circumvents patient noncompliance, resulting in more comprehensive treatmentGreatly reduces the risk of diabetic foot ulcers and diabetes-associated amputationProposed device for DSP.

University of Pennsylvania,Tumor Suppression by Retinoic Acid Pathway Inhibition,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54474,"Targeting retinoic acid (RA) synthesizing enzymes or RA receptors with small molecules boosts the immune system towards a tumor rejection responseProblem:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer globally. In the US alone, 33 000 patients are diagnosed yearly, 27 000 of which will die. Once metastasized, HCC shows a grim 5-year survival rate of 2%. Though immunotherapy has shown promise against several cancer types, it has thus far shown poor efficacy against HCC. There remains an unmet clinical need for better therapies against HCC.Solution:Researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine found that the RA pathway is crucial in modulating the immune response against tumors. Dr. Haldar and his team have found that inhibiting this pathway, either alone or combined with immunotherapy, promotes a tumor-rejecting immune response.Advantages:Efficient against aggressive cancers such as HCCTargets a specific isoform (RALDH1) to minimize side-effects from broader range inhibitors (e.g. that inhibit RALDH1, 2 and 3)Synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy to reduce ICB-resistant tumor size by over 50%Overview of retinoic acid (RA) pathway in solid tumor biology and compound #86 mechanism of action. Many solid tumors produce high levels of RA that inhibit the formation of tumor-suppressive dendritic cells (DCs) through activation of the RA and retinoid X (RX) receptors. It instead promotes the differentiation of tumor-permissive macrophages, thus allowing tumor persistence and growth. When RA synthesis (by targeting RALDH1 with C-86) and/or signaling (by inhibiting RAR/RXR) is inhibited, monocytes differentiate into DCs that activate T cells, which in turn kill tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Shifting the tumor microenvironment balance through inhibition of RA production is therefore desirable from a therapeutic perspective. Moreover, this approach can be combined to checkpoint inhibitors to enhance immune checkpoint blockage therapy.Stage of Development:Target IdentifiedPreclinical DiscoveryIntellectual Property:PCT FiledReference Media:Devalaraja, S. et al.;Cell 2020 Mar 19 180(6): 1098.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:21-9539-TpNCSWeb Published:6/21/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54474"
University of Pennsylvania,Site-blocking oligos (SBO) upregulate utrophin for treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/51043,"Synthetic oligonucleotides blocking natural degradation of utrophin to treat muscular dystrophy.Problem:Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a severe form of muscular dystrophy affecting males. A genetic mutation causes decreased production of dystrophin, a critical protein connecting cells to surrounding tissue. This leads to improper muscle development and muscle loss. Patients suffer from motor and respiratory impairment, and many people afflicted with DMD do not survive beyond their 20s. One strategy to treat DMD is to increase utrophin, a protein with similar structure and function to dystrophin. However, current strategies to artificially upregulate utrophin have not progressed clinically, because they fail to prevent the natural degradation of utrophin mRNA following transcription.Solution:The solution is a set of synthetic site-blocking oligonucleotides (SBO) which inhibits natural degradation of utrophin mRNA. These SBOs block downregulation of utrophin, increasing its expression in muscle cells which alleviates DMD symptoms. The invention works by binding to a site in utrophin mRNA which is usually targeted for degradation. Utrophin-upregulating SBOs may be used in combination with other upregulation strategies to further increase cellular expression of therapeutic utrophin.To increase production of therapeutic utrophin in muscle cells, a set of five SBOs ranging from 24-29 base pairs were synthesized. All SBOs target the same utrophin mRNA 3’-UTR region. The SBOs increase utrophin expression by hybridizing to the Let-7c microRNA binding site. This prevents Let-7c microRNA from binding to utrophin mRNA and facilitating degradation through the RNA-induced silencing complex. Utrophin-upregulating SBOs are created using a nucleic acid mimic known as a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO) to decrease undesirable toxicity and increase tissue accumulation.Advantages:-  Higher binding affinity and tissue concentration compared to other oligo alternatives-  Endogenous utrophin signal increases by 1.5-fold for 48 hours in vitro-  Two-fold higher utrophin protein expression in skeletal muscles in DMD mouse modelSchematic representation of the PMO-based SBO strategy to alleviate repression of utrophin gene.

Developing treatments for vision disorders face the unique challenge of requiring functional testing paradigms that reflect real-world situations while accurately evaluating visual function. Physical mobility test systems currently used to evaluate visual performance involve time consuming set-up procedures, cumbersome physical objects, and subjective evaluation parameters.Solution:Virtual reality provides a platform to overcome the challenges with physical mobility tests and set ups.

These devices are used in telecommunications, biosensing, and quantum computing. For known nonlinear materials, there are few options for affordable, large-scale production of nonlinear photonic devices because many are either too weak, or not compatible with CMOS processing, the primary fabrication process used in modern-day electronics.  As a result, there is a need for new nonlinear materials that can be used in scalable CMOS processes.Solution:This technology uses aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) films as a nonlinear material to make efficient CMOS-compatible photonic devices. Because most contemporary microchips are fabricated using CMOS processes, devices designed with CMOS-compatible AlScN films can be made in the same environment, lowering production costs.Technology Overview:AlScN exhibits stronger second-order optical nonlinearity than currently used materials, such as AlN. It can also be grown directly on CMOS devices due to its low sputtering temperature. The CMOS-compatibility of AlScN makes it a viable candidate to interface with silicon photonic devices as a strongly nonlinear material. In a proposed photonic device design, silicon nitride is used to define a waveguide and ring resonator structure on top of an AlScN film. When interfaced with electrical devices, the optical resonance shifts, enabling electro-optic modulation.Advantages:Highly scalable and easy to interface with silicon photonic devices due to its CMOS-compatibilityCan be used to make efficient electro-modulators as it exhibits a second-order optical nonlinearity 12 times higher than other CMOS-compatible nonlinear materials such as AlN and 2 times higher than other strongly nonlinear materials such as lithium niobate (LN)Initial design of an electro-optic modulator that uses AlScN as its nonlinear material.

In glaucoma, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) - a type of nerve cell found in the retina that processes visual information from the eye to the brain - are killed and cannot be naturally replaced. Therefore, transplantation of RGCs into the eye to replace dead RGCs promises to rescue vision loss in glaucoma patients and patients with RGC loss due to traumatic brain injury. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can be differentiated into functional RGCs, yet differentiation methods remain limited due to their complexity, irreproducibility, low yield, and use of genomic manipulation.Solution:A simplified, two-step human iPSC differentiation method optimized for the effective and reproducible generation of functionally mature RGCs. The methodology is highly efficient, enabling a highly scalable process for RGC generation. Moreover, it solely employs chemical agents for differentiation and avoids safety concerns involving genetic manipulation.Advantages:Use of chemically-defined medium avoids off-target risks involving genetic modificationHigh yield of RGCs (>95% of cells)Simultaneous production of retinal progenitor cells which can be used for transplantation to rescue photoreceptor lossDoes not require cell sorting for enrichment of RGC population in cultureSimplified technique in 2D monolayer avoids complexity and variability involving 3D organoid useiPSC-derived RGCs are mature and electrophysiologically functional (i.e. can generate action potentials)iPSC-derived RGCs when transplanted into mouse eyes integrate and extend axons through optic nerve headStage of Development:Proof of ConceptIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Chavali et al.Nat Sci Rep, 2020, 10:11828Desired Partnerships:License or collaborationCase ID:22-9778-tpNCSWeb Published:10/4/2021Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/45010"

Brenner, Muzykantov and Meyerson developed a molecular label consisting of an IgG antibody bound to dibenzocyclooctyne (D20 tag). When attached to nanoparticles, the D20 tag almost exclusively localized to marginated leukocytes to alleviate disease symptoms in a small animal model of acute inflammatory injury.

However, the success of EVD/VPS requires the accurate catheter placement. Currently, freehand techniques using anatomical landmarks suffer from a variable success rate, reported as low as 39.9% and often require multiple catheter passes. Additionally, existing devices (such as the Ghajar Guide) are cumbersome, non-adjustable, require a large incision and have a tendency to allow the catheter migrate following placement.Solution:The inventors developed a stereotactic guide, Device for Intraventricular Entry (DIVE), to assist in the placement of ventricular catheters.  DIVE provides an orthogonal trajectory for catheter placement while functioning as a low-profile skin retractor during an EVD or VPS procedure.Technology Overview:The device consists of a hollow conical base, with small footplates coming off each edge to secure the device underneath the skin.

University of Pennsylvania,Mannan-Degrading Enzymes (MDEs) Disrupting Bacterial-Fungal Biofilms for Prevention of Dental Cavities,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/43348,"Enzymes that degrade mannose to prevent the formation of bacterial-fungal biofilms, which cause dental cavitiesProblem:Dental cavities are among the most common oral diseases among children and adults in the United States, with treatments for this condition exceeding $81 billion annually. Dental cavities occur when the bacteria Streptococcus mutans feeds off residual sugar on teeth and produces tooth-decaying lactic acid. Additionally, S. mutans can cause even more severe tooth decay when it associates with the fungus Candida albicans. A surface-bound carbohydrate, mannose mediates synergistic growth of bacteria/fungus colonies by helping the two species bind to each other. Disruption of mannose-mediated bacterial-fungal biofilms interaction on teeth would prevent severe dental cavities caused by these two pathogenic microorganisms.Solution:The technology is mannan-degrading enzymes (MDEs) which break down mannose on Candida albicans cell walls to prevent bacterial binding. Specific degradation of mannans on fungal cell walls stops Streptococcus mutans from adhering to the fungal cells—consequently, less co-species biofilm forms on teeth. Limiting biofilm formation decreases the exposure of teeth to microbe-generated acids and inhibits the formation of dental cavities.Technology Overview:Three mannan-degrading enzymes are used to target fungal cell walls. The enzymes: α-mannosidase, β-mannosidase, or β-mannanase breakdown mannose on Candida albicans surfaces. These enzymes target beta-mannose sugars on mannan chains. Ultimately, this reduces the viscosity of biofilms and removes binding sites used by Streptococcus mutans on enamel.Advantages:15-fold decrease in S. mutans-C. albicans interaction force after 5-minute treatment2.5-fold decrease in biofilm dry weightUp to 90% biofilm removal by mild fluid shear stress after treatmentIncreases pH on mineral surfaces (less acidity) and decrease in enamel demineralizationEfficacy of MDEs against S. mutans-C. albicans biofilms.

University of Pennsylvania,Novel Pyrimidine Derivatives to Treat Alzheimer’s Disease,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/43214,"Brain penetrating compounds as promising therapeutics for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.Problem:An estimated 6.2 million Americans live with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), and this number is projected to reach over 13 million by 2050 with societal costs expected to rise to $1.1 trillion. A key feature of AD-affected brain tissue is the presence of insoluble tangles within neurons, leading to their dysfunction and subsequent death. These tangles are comprised of tau protein, which is normally responsible for stabilizing microtubules that are critical to normal neuronal function. However, in AD and related neurodegenerative diseases tau dissociates from microtubules, which compromises microtubule function and facilitates tangle formation.Solution:Compounds that cross the blood-brain barrier and stabilize microtubules can normalize microtubule function in AD and related diseases. Such compounds from the triazolopyrimidine chemical family have been demonstrated to be effective in vitro and in mouse models of AD.Technology Overview:A prototype triazolopyrimidine has been shown to be efficacious in normalizing microtubule function, reducing neuronal cell death and attenuating tau tangle formation in a mouse model of AD. Moreover, this prototype compound was also found to reduce the generation of amyloid plaques, another hallmark pathology of AD. Numerous novel compounds from the triazolopyrimidine family bearing various carbon 6 (C6) and carbon 7 (C7) modifications have been designed, synthetized and tested in multiple cellular assays to assess microtubule stabilization.  The most promising  of these compounds show improved potency and pharmaceutical properties relative to the initial prototype, including excellent brain exposure, greater solubility and enhanced metabolic stability.Advantages:Novel compounds with likely IP protectionMore potent in vitro than previously identified compoundsAbility to cross the blood-brain barrierBased on refined SAR and computation modeling, numerous additional novel compounds are being synthesized with likely enhanced activityLeft panel: Appearance of normal axons within the optic nerve (ON) of control wild-type mice treated with vehicle (WT Vehicle).

University of Pennsylvania,Durable and Targeted Nanoparticle Treatment for Osteoarthritis,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/43087,"An osteoarthritis treatment comprised of TGFa nanoparticles that penetrate cartilage and persist in the joint.Problem:Osteoarthritis (OA), a degenerative joint disease, is the most common form of arthritis, with over 32 million adults affected in the US alone. Despite its prevalence and debilitating nature, no cure or disease-modifying treatment exists. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway controls many key cellular functions, and mice lacking EGFR develop OA. Transforming growth factor alpha (TGFa) stimulates the EGFR pathway and reduces OA in mice. However, its short circulation lifespan drastically reduces efficacy.Solution:An engineered nanoparticle delivery system increases penetration of TGFa into the cartilage, prolongs retention of TGFa in the knee joint, and blocks OA progression in an animal model.Technology Overview:TGFa molecules are affixed to nanoparticles by specific chemistry. To reduce surface charge and increase cartilage penetration, the resulting TGFa-nanoparticles (TGFa-NP) were further engineered with a copolymer. The resulting TGFa-NP bound specifically to bovine cartilage cells and penetrated bovine cartilage tissue in vitro. Injecting engineered TGFa-NPs into the mouse knee joint prevented cartilage degeneration and promoted cartilage integrity over the course of months in a model of injury-induced OA.Advantages:Specific binding to cartilage-producing cells via TGFa-Cartilage penetration 4.76-fold better than free TGFaJoint retention 3 times longer in OA mouse joints when compared to free TGFaReduced physiological symptoms of OA in a mouse model, whereas free TGFa provides no reliefSurgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) was used to induce OA in mice.

When a patient loses a tooth the treatment options are to either not replace it, use a denture in place of the missing tooth, or insert a dental implant. While dental implants are the most invasive, costly and time-consuming option, they tend to provide the most long-term benefit to the patient.Currently, an estimated 5 million implants are placed each year in the U.S. Dental implants look and feel like natural teeth, while also being secure, unlike dentures. However, peri-implant mucositis occurs in around 40% of implants and about 15% of all cases over ~19 years post implant placement fail. Currently, there is no effective preventive measure to reduce the incidence of peri-implant diseases.Solution:Dental implants smart enough to that auto-deliver photobiomodulation therapy (PBM) to prevent plaque build-up and gum inflammation. The PBM is delivered via LEDs integrated into the dental implant and powered by the patient’s own natural oral motion.Technology Overview:The smart dental implant utilizes piezoelectric nanoparticles embedded in the dental crown to generate electricity which powers microLEDs in the abutment to create an oral photobiomodulation system that will maintain tissue health while preventing bone loss. The electricity generated by the nanoparticles within the crown is derived from the patient’s own mouth movements such as chewing, brushing and rinsing.Advantages:Sustained inhibition of bacterial growth/adhesionMaintain homeostasis of oral microbiome due to non-microbicidal infection controlConvert oral motion into electrical energy to deliver photobiomodulation therapy to the surrounding gum tissue(A) Healthy condition maintained by proposed advanced dental implant (Smart Dental Implant System), (B) unhealthy scenario with normal implant, (C) the first-generation of Smart Dental Implant systemStage of Development:Bench PrototypeIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingEuropean PatentPendingCanandian PatentPendingJapanese PatentPendingChinese PatentPendingReference Media:Park,M et al.Adv.

University of Pennsylvania,Efficient and easy-to-use decision support tool for coronary artery disease tests,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/42673,"Tool that evaluates the utility of various tests for coronary artery disease, saving time by allowing non-cardiologists to order an appropriate test.Problem:There are many clinical situations where a patient needs to be evaluated for coronary artery disease (emergency room, pre-transplant surgery, etc.). Non-cardiologists often lack the expertise needed to select the correct test. A cardiologist usually orders the test, but the process can be inefficient due to delays caused by waiting for the cardiologist to see the patient, schedule the test, and then to review the results when they become available.Solution:This web-based application allows non-cardiologists to decide which cardiac tests should be ordered. If the appropriate test is ordered in advance, the results can be available when the patients are first seen by the cardiologist, or in some cases, eliminate the need for the patient to be seen. This would expedite a number of workflows, such as patient disposition in the ER or listing for transplant.  Improved testing may also improve the diagnosis of a patient with chest pain in an emergency room.Technology Overview:The user answers a survey of 15 clinical questions that are adapted for different clinical contexts. Each question has an “info” button that provides more information. Based on the answers, utility scores are assigned to each of 10 possible tests. 10 points, color-coded green, means there are no drawbacks to using that test. 1-9 points, color-coded yellow, means that the test may be reasonable, but with concerns. 0 points, color-coded red, indicates that the test should not be used.  Rationales for the assigned scores that help inform the provider’s decision are available with one click. Clicking on the test name provides information about the test. Results can be pended or saved, and can be recalled later with the patient’s MRN.Advantages:92% agreement with decisions made by attending cardiologists in a retrospective studyAllows non-cardiologists to make informed decisionsExpedites decision regarding listing for transplantImproves workflow efficiency with faster scheduling of testsThe figure shows a sample screen of the decision support tool.

The system allows for multiple applications including (i) stratification of process of multiple gene editing for research projects, gene therapy, or cell therapy, (ii) combinatorial genetic screening in various cell types, (iii) fine-tuning expression of a gene of interest by controlling expression of multiple regulatory areas, and (iv) discovering gene interactions across diverse disease types.Advantages:Multiplex capacity – deletion of up to 20 genes simultaneouslyHigh-throughput gene screening capabilityHigh-efficiency100bp to 1000bp deletions with 80-90% efficiencyGene expression regulation by controllingIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Gier, R et al;Nat Commun, 2020 Jul 13, 11(1): 3455Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:20-9242-tpNCSWeb Published:11/5/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/42251"
University of Pennsylvania,Low-cost rapid diagnostic for COVID-19,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/42247,"A COVID-19 diagnostic approach, utilizing a SARS-CoV-2 binding biosensor, that allows for real-time virus detection, without the need for sample processing, ultimately leading to population-level surveillance, outbreak tracking, reduced healthcare costs, improved treatment outcomes, and saved lives.Problem:SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, continues to kill people at a staggering pace, threatening both public safety and the global economy. According to theWorld Health Organization, as of November 2020, there were more than 50 million reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in over 1.2 million deaths. Due to the rapid rate of transmission and risk of secondary bacterial infections, there is an urgent need to develop approaches to quickly detect and diagnose viral infection in order to inform subsequent treatment and to enable population-level surveillance and outbreak tracing. Currently, available diagnostics are limited by their high cost of production and slow detection time, thus hindering their widespread use in the population.Solution:The de la Fuente lab has created a low-cost, pocket-sized biosensor that is capable of diagnosing COVID-19. The sensor, which costs 7¢ to produce, is a printed circuit-board electrode that can diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infected samples in real time. The device can be implemented on a large-scale or connected to a smartphone to enable personalized, viral detection.Technology Overview:The biosensor’s electrode is functionalized by anchoring human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the host target of SARS-CoV-2, to the surface. A small saliva sample (2-10 μL) is transferred to the device. The selective binding between ACE2 and the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is measured through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and detected using a potentiostat. Variations in the resulting signal are used to obtain qualitative and quantitative results for the diagnosis of COVID-19.  This versatile technology has the potential to be modified and applied in the diagnosis of other viral infections.The novel diagnostic device can detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus within 4 minutes, a vast improvement on the current state-of-the-art which has a detection time of 30 minutes. Ongoing studies have demonstrated its powerful diagnostic capabilities, achieving 97% accuracy (96% sensitivity, 100% specificity) in detecting SARS-CoV-2, when compared to RT-qPCR results.

The standardized uptake value (SUV) is a quantitative measurement widely utilized for a semi-quantitative PET assessment in clinical practice. Patient-related factors including body weight and habitus, and technical factors including image acquisition methods and image reconstruction methods may adversely affect the accuracy of PET-derived measurements. Attempting to account for all adverse factors remains a challenge to the goal of accurate and reproducible measurements from PET images.Solution:A computer algorithm to standardize PET images and reduce errors in PET quantification. This algorithm does not use patient-related or scanner-related factors which allows it to be applied across scanners and image acquisition protocols and even for already existing data sets.Technology Overview:The standardization operation is applicable to both PET and SUV images. A calibration step is first applied to a series of training images from which key parameters characterizing a standardization mapping are determined. This operation is performed only once. Subsequently, for any given image to be standardized, a standardization transformation is applied by estimating the corresponding parametric values for the given image and utilizing the learned parametric values.

University of Pennsylvania,Nonvolatile memory devices fabricated at a complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible temperature,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/42214,"High-performance nonvolatile memory devices integrated with ferroelectric Aluminum Scandium Nitride (AlScN) films that can be directly deposited on the silicon at low temperature (≤ 350 °C)Problem:Strong demand for high-density non-volatile memory (NVM) devices with low power consumption is being driven by new applications of non-von Neumann computing architectures, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence. Ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET)-based nonvolatile memories are the most compelling emerging NVM devices due to their high access speed, high endurance, and low energy consumption. However, applications of FeFETs suffer from the lack of reliable industrial-scale production of ferroelectric films and incompatibility with complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) processing temperatures.Solution:The researchers developed AlScN FeFET memory devices that integrate Aluminum Scandium Nitride (AlScN) films. The integration and fabrication process can be done at a CMOS-compatible temperature (≤350 °C). The resulting memory devices offer high performance with a large memory window ranging from 20 to 40 V, a high on/off ratio of over 106, and a maximum on-current of 3 mA with channel dimensions W/L = 12 μm/3 μm.Technology Overview:AlScN alloys have large coercive fields and high remnant polarizations, which allows them to be scaled into thinner ferroelectric layers with smaller FeFET gate dimensions while maintaining large memory windows and large bit density. The low deposition temperature (≤ 350 °C) of AlScN also allows for FeFET integration directly into a CMOS. The AlScN thin films are used as ferroelectric gate dielectrics in FeFET-based memories, so that film deposition can be done at a CMOS-compatible temperature.Advantages:Deposition of AlScN films can be done at a CMOS-compatible temperature (≤ 350 °C)The on/off ratio of the fabricated AlScN FeFETs is ~106, 100+ times higher than currently available FeFETs.The normalized memory window over the thickness of the ferroelectric film is 40 V/100 nm, which is the highest among all the reported FeFETs at room temperature.The anticipated memory window on a 13-nm AlScN is 2X that of the HfZrO with the same thickness, which lowers the voltage required to polarize the gate dielectricsSchematic of the experimental AlScN FeFET in On- and Off-States; the blue part represents the AlScN film.Stage of Development:Bench PrototypeIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Liu, X et al.;Nano Lett 2021 May 12  21(9): 3753Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:20-9330-tpNCSWeb Published:11/2/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/42214"
University of Pennsylvania,Novel Inhibitors of Ferroptosis,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/51046,"Novel derivatives of oleic acid effectively inhibiting ferroptosis that could be used for treatment of Friedreich Ataxia, neurodegenerative diseases, and neuropsychiatric diseases.Problem:Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic form of cell death characterized by the iron-dependent accumulation of toxic lipid-reactive oxygen species. Ferroptosis has been suggested to be the main driver of neurological cell death in diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease, and Huntington's disease as well as in neuropsychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and depression.In addition, previous studies from Dr. Wilson’s lab showed that Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), an inherited neurodegenerative disorder, may involve ferroptosis in its pathogenesis (Cotticelli et al., 2019). Thus, the development of novel ferroptosis inhibitors is currently considered a promising avenue for treatment of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases.Solution:Based on reports that oleic acid acts as a ferroptosis inhibitor, the inventors evaluated whether it, other fatty acids, and fatty acid derivatives could rescue viability in cellular models of FRDA. Thirteen new analogs were synthesized, with a focus on improving metabolic stability and improving physico-chemical properties. Several compounds were significantly more potent than oleic acid in rescuing cell viability in cells treated with ferroptosis inducers or FRDA sensitizers.

The membrane is highly permeable and rejects divalent salts efficiently due to its unique water-channel architecture.Problem:Nanofiltration is an important emerging technology for low-pressure, and therefore low-cost, industrial wastewater remediation. It allows for the removal of pesticide residues, harmful organic small molecules, and macromolecules. Nanofiltration is also valued for water purification and softening through the removal of divalent ions that harden water, while at the same time, retaining minerals that Reverse Osmosis (RO) would otherwise remove.However, nanofiltration is not commonly used at industrial scales due to performance compromises originating in the broad pore size distribution that is inherent to current commercial membranes. Moreover, current nanofiltration membranes are expensive and need to be replaced periodically to prevent biofouling and chlorine degradation during cleaning.Solution:Bicontinuous, single-nanometer water channel architecture enables efficient membrane filtration due to its very low internal hydraulic resistance. This membrane architecture is highly selective and permeable, and it rejects divalent ions and small molecules efficiently. The membranes are resistant to fouling and last longer in chemical cleaning agents.Technology Overview:This highly selective nanofiltration membrane is made by crosslinking a lyotropic liquid crystal based on a cationic surfactant. The quaternary ammonium in the polar head of the surfactant provides fouling resistance. Self-arrangement in columnar profiles allows single-nanometer water-bi-continuous transport. This leads to efficient nanofiltration with higher permeability and better solute selectivity.Advantages:Improved purification capability via small molecule and salt rejectionSuperior hydraulic performance over 10 Lm2h-1bar-1Fouling resistant and longer lasting membranesNanofiltration rejection efficiencies: (top) Dominant rejection of divalent ions in various salt solutions with a consistent ionic strength.

While current multi-fiber materials are able to adapt their shape to the structure of interest, they have limited mechanical strength, and therefore, fail easily under strain. Furthermore, these materials have weak self-adhesive properties, preventing them from holding their shape once in place.Solution:This invention describes a new approach for designing multi-fiber materials that provides several advantages over currently available materials. Individual fibers in the materials are designed to have specific chemistries that allow new chemical bonds to form under mechanical strain. As a result, these new bonds increase the tensile strength of the material and allow it to adhere to itself.Technology Overview:In this technology, multi-fiber materials are synthesized to have at least two fiber populations with compatible chemistries, such as aldehyde and hydrazide groups (See Figure). Upon mechanical strain, the chemical groups on each fiber population will come into contact and undergo a chemical reaction to form new bonds. Even after the mechanical strain is removed, these new bonds maintain the fiber alignment and help increase tensile strength. This also provides the multi-fiber material with exceptional self-adhesive properties, allowing it to hold its shape without the need for additional glues or bonding steps.Advantages:Provides 14-fold higher adhesive strength compared to traditional multi-fiber materialsThe fiber backbone, chemical groups, and processing methods can all be fully customized for the application of interestSelf-adhesion is possible under a variety of strains including stretching, twisting, stacking and rollingThe tensile strength of the material improves under strain, and fiber alignment is maintained after the strain is removedSchematic for the self-adhesive multi-fiber materials. In this multi-fiber system, fibers are synthesized to have complementary chemistries such as aldehyde (green) and hydrazide (red) groups. (A) When these fibers experience mechanical strain (such as stretching), these groups come into contact and form new chemical bonds with each other. Even when the mechanical strain is removed, these new bonds remain in place. (B) Complex interactions and self-adhesion can also be achieved by twisting, stacking, and rolling the multi-fiber system.  (Figure source:Davidson et al.

Disinfecting the MRI scanner bore is of particular importance due to the substantial time the patient spends in the bore, the close contact between the patient and the bore, and continuous patient turnover. The scanner bore presents a significant challenge to disinfect due to the strong magnet field and the space constraints imposed by the bore size and geometry. Also, for maximum effectiveness at controlling pathogen spread, disinfection of the bore must occur between each patient without disrupting the MRI schedule.Current method of disinfecting the bore involves the use of harsh chemicals manually applied by the MRI technician, which is inconsistent, time-consuming, and challenging to perform between patients due to scheduling constraints and MRI technician’s patient responsibilities. Additionally, the harsh chemical residues and fumes produced by the current method can corrode sensitive electronic systems as well as affect some patients.Solution:To address the limitations of the current manual method of MRI bore disinfection, a device was developed that can rapidly and effectively disinfect this area using UV-C light.The device is specifically designed to use non-ferrous materials and shielding of the electronic components to eliminate magnetic field interference. The system produces an intensity of UV-C which disinfects the entire MRI bore within minutes, enables rapid setup and removal, eliminates the use of harsh chemicals, minimizes the MRI technician involvement, and provides the capability to rapidly and effectively disinfect the MRI bore between patients.Advantages:Magnetic field safeRapid and effective disinfectionEasy set up and operationSmall sizeLow costApplication:Disinfection of bore for MRI and other types of scanners (CT, PET, PET-MR, SPECT)Stage of Development:Built prototypeConfirmed effectivenessIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingPCTPendingDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:20-9379-tpNCSWeb Published:10/14/2021Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/45130"
University of Pennsylvania,Targeted Drug Delivery Using Red-Blood Cells for Transport,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/40454,"Platform technology for targeted drug delivery using red blood cells for transport.Problem:Drug delivery can often result in up to 99% of the drug being delivered to off-target organs. This can lead to side-effects and toxicities. Current methods that bind drugs to red-blood cells for transport can require modifying the structure of the red blood cell.Solution:A platform technology for targeted drug delivery to target organs while reducing off target drug effects. This platform technology can be used with a variety of small molecule drugs required for treating organ sites without modifying the structure of the red blood cell.Technology Overview:Liposomes have been engineered to display antibodies that target red-blood cells and specific organ-sites, allowing for dual targeting. The liposomes can be loaded with a variety of small molecule drugs. Binding the liposome loaded with the drug molecule to red blood cells allows for leveraging red blood cells as drug shuttles and carriers.Advantages:2x greater drug delivery to the targeted organ as compared to passive red blood cell bindingControl of nanocarrier binding to red blood cell to reduce variabilityUtilization with a broad range of nanocarriersIncreased plasma half-life of nanocarriersStage of Development:In vivo proof of conceptIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Ferguson, LT et al.ACS Nano 2022 March 22 16(3):4666.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:20-9162-tpNCSWeb Published:6/23/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/40454"
University of Pennsylvania,Protein Drugs Encapsulated in Plant Cells as Low-Cost Prevention and Treatment of Lung Injury in COVID-19 Patients,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/40119,"Use of functional recombinant ACE2 and Angiotensin-(1-7) proteins to improve the clinical course of patients with symptomatic COVID-19 infection.Problem:COVID-19 is associated with high rates of respiratory failure, cardiac injury and death. Patients suffering from COVID-19 generally present with reduced expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and depletion of ACE2’s protein product, the anti-inflammatory peptide Angiotensin-(1-7). This down-regulation of ACE2 expression is induced by viral invasion of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19 disease. Decreased ACE2 expression has been linked to acute respiratory distress, severe lung injury, multi-organ failure and death, especially in older patients.Solution:As a potential treatment for the severe complications of COVID-19 disease, oral supplementation of ACE2 and Angiotensin-(1-7) are being tested in a clinical trial to determine whether this intervention elicits protective effects on cardiac and respiratory function in COVID-19 patents. Restoring ACE2 with this therapeutic may mitigate virus-mediated lung and cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients.Technology Overview:Dr. Daniell and colleagues have developed a platform for producing recombinant ACE2 and Angiotensin-(1-7) in lettuce plants that is shelf-stable. Preclinical studies in pulmonary hypertension animal models showed that orally delivered ACE2 made in plant cells accumulated ten times higher in the lungs than in the blood and treated pulmonary hypertension at doses without any toxic effects. This application of plant-derived ACE2 therapy to patients with COVID-19 infection is enabled, in part, by prior toxicology studies done at Stanford Research Institute funded by NIH SMARTT program.  The fact that freeze-dried plant cells can be stored at ambient temperature for one year and can be taken at home by COVID-19 patients are other attractive features of this novel approach.Advantages:Low-cost delivery compared to traditional protein therapies and/or gene therapiesPotential for reducing the use of high-cost, high-demand medical supplies such as ventilatorsTreatment for lung injury caused by COVID-19 diseaseOral ACE2 and Ang(1-7) Supplementation In Symptomatic COronaVIrus Disease (The OAASIS COVID trial): Background information on application of invention to COVID-19 patients.Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the binding site for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the lungs.Downregulation of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 leads to excess Ang II (pro-inflammatory) and reduced Ang (1-7) (anti-inflammatory)Intervention: Supplement ACE2 and Ang(1-7) with an orally-delivered plant-based formulation to debulk  SARS-CoV2 and restore a more favorable balance of AngII and Ang(1-7)Stage of Development:Therapeutics: Phase I/II clinical trialIntellectual Property:US10,314,893US10,806,775US11,241,487EP3,058,074CA2,957,211Reference Media:Daniell, H. et al.;Biomaterials, 2020 Mar, 233: 119750Kwon, K & Daniell, HPlant Biotechnol J, 2015 Oct, 13(8): 1017Shenoy, V. et al.;Hypertension, 2014 Dec, 64(6): 1248Shil, PK et al.;Mol Ther, 2014 Dec, 22(12): 2069Baillie, KUPenn Today 5.5.20Penn Dental Med Website.

University of Pennsylvania,Therapeutic Antibodies Against Pathological Tau Proteins for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD),,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39972,"Two novel monoclonal antibodies were discovered that target pathological conformations of the tau protein. The antibodies were shown in vitro and in vivo to inhibit the spread of pathological tau protein aggregates, which is one of the defining characteristics of AD.Problem:More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease  which is the 6th leading cause of death (Alzheimer’s Association. 2020 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures. Alzheimer’s Dement 2020). Current treatments do not adequately slow the progression of the diseases. By 2022, the market for AD therapeutics is expected to reach nearly USD $9 billion, a significant percentage  of which is anticipated to be novel antibodies directed against tau, and beta amyloid proteins (Potential Pipeline Disruptors, Kalorama Information, 2017).Intracellular tau protein aggregates are a pathological hallmark of AD. In the disease state, misfolded tau spreads from cell to cell thereby introducing seed aggregates in neighboring cells which perpetuate the pathology of the disease.Solution:The novel monoclonal antibodies are designed to bind to the misfolded tau released from neurons and prevent it from entering nearby cells, thus slowing down disease progression.Technology Overview:Two monoclonal antibodies were developed against the pathological form of tau. These antibodies have been fully sequenced and shown to be active in vitro, and in vivo in a murine model of Alzheimer’s disease. The antibodies were generated by immunization of mice using AD-tau paired helical filaments (PHFs).These novel conformation-selective tau antibodies selectively bind to pathological tau compared to recombinant tau monomer, block the uptake of tau fibrils into cells, and prevent the cell-to-cell transmission of tau pathology in primary neurons and in a mouse model of AD.Advantages:Selective binding to pathological tau conformersPrevention of cell-to-cell transmission of aggregated tauPotential ability to slow down Alzheimer’s disease progressionAntibody DMR7 inhibits seeded aggregation of tau protein in mouse primary neurons.

University of Pennsylvania,Functional Nerve Guidance Conduit for the Rapid Treatment of Peripheral Nerve Injuries,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39786,"A collagen-based nerve guidance conduit containing functional Schwann cell precursor-like cells derived from stem cells for the rapid treatment of peripheral nerve injuries.Technology Overview:A peripheral nerve injury (PNI) occurs in approximately 3% of all trauma patients. While treatment options for PNIs have improved with advances in microsurgical techniques and development of nerve guidance conduits, less than 50% of PNIs show full functional recovery. The current gold standard of treatment for PNI is the use of nerve autografts, which is further limited by the availability of nerve sources, donor/recipient mismatch, and severe donor‐site morbidity associated with secondary surgical procedure.Schwann cells are peripheral nervous system glial cells that make myelin around axons. Schwann cells play a critical role in repairing damage to the peripheral nervous system related to axonal regrowth during nerve repair and regeneration.The Le group has developed a method of generating functionalized nerve guidance conduits for use in repairing PNIs. This method utilizes mesenchymal stem cells from gingiva tissue (GMSC) of a neural crest-origin and converts them into neural crest stem-like (NCSC) or Schwann cell precursor (SCP)-like cells encapsulated and cultured in 3D-collagen hydrogel.Whereas nerve guidance conduits in combination with various types of supportive cells have previously been tested for repairing PNIs, their success has varied due to a lack of uniformity in their cellular makeup and matrix embedding. GMSC-laden collagen hydrogels offer an improved approach for direct conversion of GMSCs into NCSC/SCP-like cells with the capability to trans-migrate and integrate into the aligned wall matrix of natural nerve, forming a functionalized nerve guidance conduit with unique capability for PNI regeneration and functional recovery as demonstrated in the crush-injured rat sciatic nerve model.Advantages:Fewer donor/recipient mismatch issues expectedEnhanced capability to differentiate into Schwann-like cellsShorter time interval for differentiation into Schwann-like cellsMesenchymal stem cells from gingiva are more proliferative than those from bone marrowApplications:Treatment of peripheral nerve injuriesStage of Development:Proof of concept demonstrated in ratsIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Zhang, Q et al.Mol Neurobiol.2018 Aug; 55(8): 6965.Mao, Q. et al.Tissue Eng Part A., 2019 Jun, 25(11-12): 887.Zhang, Q. et al.Sci Rep. 2018 Apr, 8(1): 6634.Zhang, Q. et al.Stem Cells Transl Med. 2017 Feb, 6(2): 458.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:19-9008-tpNCSWeb Published:5/5/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39786"
University of Pennsylvania,Lipid nanoparticle-based mRNA delivery for CAR T-cell engineering,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39766,"A library of ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) was screened for ability to deliver mRNA to T-cells, leading to an optimized LNP formulation for delivery of mRNA to T-cells. This thereby enhances the ability to generate transient chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T-cells for cancer immunotherapy.Problem:Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are T-cells that have been genetically engineered to express a synthetic T-cell receptor that gives them the ability to initiate immune responses against specific proteins.By engineering T-cells to target proteins expressed specifically by cancer cells, CAR T-cells are a highly effective cancer immunotherapy. The current manufacturing process of generating CAR T-cells utilizes viruses to permanently express the CAR on the T-cell surface. This permanent CAR expression is associated with adverse side effects such as cytokine storm and neurotoxicity long after the CAR T-cells have performed their therapeutic function.Solution:This technology overcomes the challenges associated with virally engineered CAR T-cell therapy is by utilizing LNPs to transfect T-cells with CAR-encoding mRNA. Because mRNA is translated without genomic integration, this results in transient CAR expression.Technology Overview:This technology is a novel ionizable lipid (C14-4) and a method of synthesizing (C14-4)-based LNPs. A library of novel ionizable lipids was generated and screened for their ability to transduce T-cells with mRNA when combined into LNPs. The novel ionizable lipid with the highest T-cell transfection efficiency was C14-4 and this was subsequently shown to be more effective than lipofectamine electroporation at generating CAR T-cells via delivery of CAR mRNA. CAR T-cells generated with (C14-4)-based LNPs are effective at killing cancer in vitro.Advantages:C14-4 LNP-based delivery of CAR mRNA to T-cells results in transient CAR expression, thereby decreasing the likelihood of adverse side effects caused by permeant CAR expression resulting from viral T-cell engineering.Enhanced mRNA delivery to T-cells relative to electroporation with lipofectamine.Less toxic to T-cells than electroporation with lipofectamine.(A) Schematic of the components used to generate LNPs via microfluidic mixing and the expected structure of the resulting LNPs.

University of Pennsylvania,Rapid Method to Design and Screen Novel Lipid Nanoparticles for mRNA Delivery In Vivo,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39765,"A platform technology to rapidly identify novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations to carry mRNA-based therapeutics to target organs/cells in vivo.Problem:Messenger RNA (mRNA) has emerged as a promising new class of nucleic acid therapy, with the potential to induce protein production to treat and prevent a range of diseases. While significant progress has been made in the design of in vitro-transcribed mRNA, the widespread use of mRNA as a therapeutic requires safe and effective delivery of the mRNA to tissues in vivo.Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are an emerging method to deliver mRNA to cells in vivo. However, targeting LNPs to deliver their mRNA cargo to a specific tissue of interest following intravenous injection has hampered their utility.Solution:This is a platform technology to screen for novel LNP formulations that optimize mRNA delivery to a desired cell type or organ in vivo.Technology Overview:The technology consists of a library of engineered LNPs that encapsulate functional, custom-designed barcoded mRNA (b-mRNA). These b-mRNA are similar in structure and function to regular mRNA and contain barcodes that enable their delivery to be quantified via deep sequencing.Using a mini-library of b-mRNA LNPs, a pool of different b-mRNA LNP formulations can be simultaneously administered intravenously into mice as a single pool. The relative delivery efficacy of different b-mRNA LNPs to any target organ can then be determined via deep sequencing to determine the relative abundance of all b-mRNA LNPs in the organ of interest.Advantages:Accelerates the in vivo screening and design of LNPs for mRNA therapeutic applications such as CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, mRNA vaccination, and other mRNA-based regenerative medicine and protein replacement therapies.This platform can be used to identify LNP formulations that target antigen presenting cells for mRNA-based vaccine development.Novel LNPs + luciferase encoding b-mRNA are formulated via microfluidic mixing such that each novel b-mRNA is encapsulated by a novel LNP formulation. Different LNP formulations are then pooled together and administered intravenously to mice.

Over the past few years, immunotherapies that target common genetic mutations has dramatically changed the landscape of melanoma treatment but some patients with advanced metastatic melanoma still have a significant risk of mortality. New therapeutic approaches are needed.Dr. Ridky proposes a CAR-T cell based technology to selective killing of melanocytes. These CARs do not target uveal melanocytes. Killing of melanoma cells and melanocytes, with little to no killing of human fibroblasts using these engineered CAR T-cells was shown in vitro as well as in vivo in NSG mice. But melanocytes are dispensable.Advantages:Would circumvent relapse seen with check point inhibitors and other forms of treatment for melanoma.Offers selective killing of melanoma cells and melanocytes with little toxicity on other cells types.Applications:CAR T-cell based treatment is an option to treat invasive melanoma as it causes regression of the tumor by selectively killing melanoma cells and melanocytes.Can provide an alternative treatment for patients with advanced metastatic melanoma and for patients on whom immunotherapy/check point inhibitors does not work.Stage of Development:Killing of melanoma cells and melanocytes in vitro and in in vivo in NSG mice.Intellectual Property:US PatentPendingDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:17-8000-tpNCSWeb Published:5/5/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39785"

The role of sex steroid hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone, has been studied in reproductive organ cancers such as prostate and breast cancer, but not in other non-androgen (AR)-driven cancers. Recent studies have shown that testosterone promotes cancer cell proliferation.Solution:Inhibiting testosterone-induced tumor growth as a new therapeutic approach for non-AR-driven cancer.Technology Overview:Dr. Ridky and colleagues demonstrated that testosterone promotes cancer cell proliferation through a non-AR-dependent mechanism.  Four existing FDA-approved androgen receptor inhibitors, flutamide, bicalutamide, enzalutamide, and apalutamide, are inhibiting the proliferation of different cancer cell lines, from non-reproductive non-AR expressing tissues. Hence these therapeutics may have a way broader therapeutic effect than earlier contemplated.Advantages:Enhance effectiveness of current cancer therapy treatment using already approved drugsTop Figure: Both bicalutamide (CDX) and enzalutamide (ENZ) completely block testosterone-induced proliferation of melanoma cell lines.

University of Pennsylvania,Up-regulators of utrophin expression for the treatment of muscular dystrophy,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39678,"Small molecules targeting utrophin mRNA untranslated regions overcome post-transcriptional repressionProblem:Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked neuromuscular disorder that affects approximately 1 in 3500 males worldwide. DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene that lead to severe reduction or loss of dystrophin protein. Without appropriate dystrophin expression, patients experience progressive muscle degeneration and weakness that leads to early death around the third decade of life. While corticosteroids can be used to slow disease progression, there is no definitive cure for DMD.Solution:In the absence of dystrophin, the autosomal homolog utrophin has been shown to partially replace dystrophin function. Utrophin is highly expressed during fetal development, but is actively down-regulated in adult muscle through numerous post-transcriptional repression mechanisms. Rather than supplement utrophin expression using gene therapy, this technology prevents repression of endogenous utrophin transcripts in adult muscle to enhance expression.Technology Overview:Scientists in the Khurana lab used high-throughput screening to identify small molecule compounds that increase utrophin expression by acting at the 5’ and/or 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of the utrophin transcript. Lead compounds were prioritized using an algorithm developed by the Inventors that incorporates specificity and dose-response characteristics. The top 5 hits from a SelleckChem Bioactive Compound library (detailed in Table 2 Loro, Emanuele et al.) are all approved by the FDA for clinical testing. In vivo validation of the top hit, trichostatin A (TSA) showed increased utrophin expression and muscle function after three months in a mouse model of DMD (see figure). A second screen comprising 96,000 small molecules revealed five additional novel compounds that may be developed as DMD therapeutics.Advantages:Eight of the top 10 SelleckChem compounds increase utrophin expression over 1.5-foldSeven of the top 10 SelleckChem hits have been used in clinical trials which provide safety and tolerability information in humansApproach enables expression of full-length protein, in contrast to gene replacement strategies that are limited by vector sizeUse of small molecules avoids potential toxic immune response against viral vectors or transgenesIn vivo preclinical validation of TSA treatment in the mdx mouse model of DMD.

The Müllerian Inhibiting Substance Type 2 Receptor (MISIIR),a member of the TGF-β receptor family, overexpressed in the majority of ovarian tumors and other gynecologic tumors, makes it an appealing target for cell immunotherapy.Dr. Powell and colleagues have developed MISIIR-specific CAR T cells with distinct single-chain antibody variable fragments of MISIIR, coupled to CD27 and CD3z intracellular signaling domains. The select GM7-27Z CAR variant exhibits antigen-specific reactivity, cytokine secretion and tumor cell lysis in vitro against a broad range of human tumor cell lines including ovarian and endometrial cancer expressing variable levels of endogenous MISIIR. GM7-27Z does not exhibit cytotoxicity when co-cultured with a broad panel of normal primary human cells, suggesting a safe profile of targeting. Additionally, in vivo GM7 CAR T cells showed potent antitumor effect in immunocompromised mice bearing large established subcutaneous C30.MISIIR tumors, completely clearing 60% of the tumors and significantly prolonging mice survival. Overall, the GM7-27Z variant supports the potential of MISIIR as a novel target for the efficacious and safe treatment of ovarian cancer and other gynecologic malignancies using CAR T cell therapy.Advantages:Enhances capability of CAR T therapy use for the treatment of solid tumors, particularly those related to ovarian cancerImproved safety, specificity, and targeting of CAR T cells to tumor cells given very low expression levels of MISIIR in healthy tissue tissue but overexpression in gynecologic cancersApplications:CAR T therapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer and other gynecologic malignancies(A)Schematic representation of MISIIR CAR constructs based on 4 different scFv and containing CD27 and CD3z I trace lunar domains.

University of Pennsylvania,Improving Drug Delivery Using Red Blood Cell Hitchhiking,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38534,"Problem:A major challenge in drug delivery is ensuring that the drug reaches the target organ at a concentration sufficient to treat the disease. This is particularly problematic for acute illnesses of the vasculature, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction. In these diseases, patients are often too sick to tolerate off-target drug side effects, and systemically delivered drugs rarely accumulate to a significant extent in the organs affected by pathology.Solution:Drs. Jacob Brenner and Vladimir Muzykantov have developed a drug delivery system that can address these challenges. The drug delivery system, “Red Blood Cell (RBC)-Hitchhiking Nanoparticles” (RHNs), utilizes soft nanoparticles, such as liposomes and nanogels, loaded with drugs and the natural properties of RBCs to target the lung endothelium. The nanoparticles are adsorbed onto the surface of the RBC and delivered intravascularly. Once the nanoparticle-RBCs encounter their first capillary bed, the RBCs are physically squeezed, causing the release of the drug-loaded nanoparticles into the capillary endothelium. Since delivery is dependent on the squeezing of RBCs, the nanoparticles do not release their drug cargo until they enter the pulmonary capillaries. This approach minimizes delivery of the drug to sites other than the target organ and ensures that sufficient drug concentration reaches the target site.Advantages:Minimize off-target drug effectsMaximize delivery of drug to target organCan be delivered intravenously to target the lungs or via intra-arterial catheters to deliver to any target organ, including the brain and heartApplications:Targeted drug delivery for treatment of diseases of the capillary endothelium: ARDS, ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarctionImage courtesy ofBrenner JS et al.

Primary barriers to efficient DNA sequencing include high signal to noise ratios allowing for discrimination between DNA bases and detection of short nucleotide sequences through nanoporous membranes.Solution:This technology portfolio allows for the detection of short DNA sequences using ultra-thin membranes with small diameter nanopores, resulting in higher ionic conductance and increased bias current.

Ultra-thin SiN membranes are generated using local thinning via ion etching on a defined region onto which nanopores are generating using electron beans. Ultra-thin SiN membranes allow for the detection of short nucleic acid molecules. Glass-only supported SiN membranes reduce silicon-supported nanopore device capacitance, and are generated by selectively etching small pores in a aSi/SiN/Glass/SiN/aSi substrate.Additionally, fabrication methods for generating 1-2nm diameter nanopores in membranes and generating insulated nanoscale electrode gaps have been developed. The small nanopore diameter is comparable with the width of single stranded DNA. A silicone chip is first coated with silicon dioxide with silicon nitride subsequently deposited. The chips are then etched, and the resulting window is locally thinned and nanopores are drilled. The insulated nanoscale electrode gaps are fabricated using beam lithography to create coarse gaps. A dielectric material is then added to provide insulation to focus the current density between electrodes.Lastly, methods for generating and using graphene nanopore membranes to measure DNA translocation have been developed. The use of graphene-based nanopore devices improves the overall signal-to-noise ratio. A Chemical Vapor Deposition technique is used to fabricate a multi-layer graphene membrane. Transmission electron beam ablation lithography and UV/ozone treatments are then applied to create nanopores within the membrane.Advantages:Optimized detection of short nucleic acid molecules and single stranded DNAIncreased bias current and higher ionic conductanceFocused current density between nanoelectrodes due to electrode insulationImproved signal to noise values during DNA sequencingReduced device capacitance from other Si-supported designs from ~50pF to ~0.1 pF, the capacity for sequencing free-running DNADetails of solid-state nanopore fabrication.

University of Pennsylvania,Fully human anti-mesothelin CAR with low immunogenicity for in vivo persistence of anti-tumor engineered T cells,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38359,"The fully human CAR targets mesothelin, a surface protein overexpressed in several cancer types. P4, a human antibody fragment that binds human mesothelin with high specificity, is fused to T cell signaling domains such as 28z. The T cells engineered to express this CAR are shown to shrink tumors in a mouse model bearing human ovarian tumors overexpressing mesothelin.Problem:Though engineered anti-mesothelin chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells show encouraging pre-clinical results against certain cancer types, their clinical efficiency is stunted by their poor long-term persistence in infused human patients.Indeed, anti-mesothelin CARs are generally designed using mouse antibody fragments, which can trigger a detrimental immune response against the CAR T cells and destroy them (Maus et al, 2014), thus limiting their cancer destroying potential to a narrow time-frame.Solution:Instead of using a mouse antibody fragment for engineering CARs, Dr. Powell and his team have produced a fully human anti-mesothelin CAR that shows high cancer killing potential, yet very low immunogenicity.Advantages:In vivo persistence of infused CAR T cells after infusion.Low immunogenicity compared to mouse-derived antibody fragments.Not inhibited by soluble mesothelin secreted by cancer cells.Application:Therapy efficient against mesothelin-expressing tumor cells.Human ovarian tumor regression in an immunodeficient mouse model.

University of Pennsylvania,X-Ray Irradiation-Activated Hydrogel for Effective On-Demand Treatment of Glioblastoma and Other Tumors,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/37646,"Primary tumor reoccurrence often occurs following surgical resection in glioblastoma multiforme patients. Current hydrogel approaches deliver therapeutics using light or pH, but these approaches are limited by the tumor microenvironment. Researchers have developed an injectable hydrogel with unique materials that can be activated by X-ray irradiation for sustained, on-demand therapeutic delivery. These hydrogels can be loaded with CT contrast agents and therapeutic drugs without affecting their functionality, morphology, or injectability.Problem:Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive types of brain cancers. Patients diagnosed with GBM have a median survival of 14 months and two-year survival rate of 27%. These patients undergo extensive treatment, including surgical tumor resection followed by chemotherapy infusion and radiation, yet 70% of patients experience reoccurrence of the primary tumor. Injectable hydrogel biomaterials allow for the sustained delivery of anti-cancer therapeutics within the tumor cavity. Activation of hydrogels with light or changes in pH allow for the on-demand release of therapeutics. However, these activation approaches are limited by the inability of light to penetrate deeper into tissue and unanticipated fluctuations in pH of the tumor microenvironment.Solution:Dr. Bouche and colleagues at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania have developed an injectable hydrogel that can be activated by X-ray irradiation for on-demand release of anti-cancer therapeutics. X-ray irradiation is highly focused and not limited by tissue depth. Further, patients undergoing treatment for GBM are already prescribed radiation, eliminating the need for an additional treatment for drug delivery activation. Sustained release by radiation-sensitive hydrogels with dual loaded contrast agents and anti-cancer drug therapies could enhance post-surgical resection radiation targeting and prevent primary tumor reoccurrence.Advantages:On-demand drug delivery deeper in tissue compared to current activated hydrogelsConvenient drug delivery activation method for cancer patientsTunable properties for spatiotemporal control of drug deliveryApplications:Cancer therapeuticsDrug deliveryMedical imagingTreatment of brain tumors with X-ray irradiation-activated hydrogelsStage of Development:Prototyped & tested in small animal modelPre-clinical discoveryIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:19-8911-tpNCSWeb Published:1/7/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/37646"

Event-based vision is an emerging technology wherein computer algorithms process imagery obtained from a camera and provide time-stamped images where pixel intensity corresponds to dynamic changes in the images and how recent the change has been. Such images can be used as an input to a convolutional neural network to detect and predict events.Existing methods require the use training datasets to train convolutional neural networks that can subsequently predict motion. This process is computationally intense and requires the method to discard image frames for real-time applications, thereby reducing the temporal resolution of the event detection.Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed an algorithm that can use a self-supervised convolutional neutral network to detect motion and predict an indication of an event from images obtained using one or multiple cameras. The method uses a multilayer convolutional neural network to detect motion and flow of the pixels at different spatial resolutions. The images obtained from multiple cameras can be used in the algorithm to more accurately associate discretized time stamps to each change, and ultimately improve the temporal resolution of event detection and prediction.Advantages:Enables use of self-supervised learning for motion detection in imagesUnsupervised learning using a self-supervised neural network requires minimal or no manual labeling of a training datasetHigh dynamic range in event-based vision enables more sensitive detection of motion and events.Applications:Navigation for self-driving automobiles and dronesEvent based camerasSelf-supervised learning to detect motion and events using event-based camerasMotion and event prediction from imagesExample of a timestamp image.

University of Pennsylvania,Anti-Pulfrich monovision ophthalmic corrections that reduce depth misperception,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39060,"Technology Overview:Presbyopia is the age-related loss of your eyes’ ability to focus on objects that are up close. A normal part of the aging process, the effects of presbyopia typically begin in humans sometime around 45 years of age.Researchers have estimated that there are close to 2 billion worldwide that have presbyopia.Monovision is a common prescription lens correction for presbyopia. With monovision, each eye is corrected to focus light from a different distance, causing one image to be blurrier than the other. The brain suppresses the blurrier image and preferentially processes the sharper one, thereby expanding the depth of field. This differential blur that occurs between the lenses results in a motion illusion that makes people misperceive the distance and directional movement of three-dimensional objects. This depth misperception has been coined as the reverse Pulfrich effect.By tinting the lens that causes the blurry image, the depth misperceptions will be eliminated. This non-invasive technique has been shown by measuring how blur differences affect neural processing times with sub-millisecond precision.Currently, the biggest challenge with monovision corrections comes from the decrease in stereovision and depth misperceptions. The ability to eliminate depth misperceptions enables a new branch of “premium monovision corrections” that will have a positive impact in the prescription of this type of corrections.Advantages:Eliminates depth misperceptions currently experienced by users of monovision corrected lensesApplications:Premium monovision ophthalmic correction lensesScreening device to assess the reverse Pulfrich effect caused by interocular blur differencesClassic and Reverse Pulfrich EffectsStage of Development:Corrected monovision misperceptions have been validated with 3 human observers in visual perception and visual opticsPrototype apparatus and software have been developedIntellectual Property:PCTPendingUS PatentPendingEuropean PatentPendingReference Media:Burge J, et al.:Curr Biol 2019 Aug 5, 29(15): 2586Case ID:19-8887-tpNCSWeb Published:3/4/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39060"

New therapeutics that offer significant improvements for those already exposed to, or at risk for, ischemic injury are needed.Drs. Epstein, Gruber, and Abdullah have shown several histone deacetylase (HDAC) and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors, epigenetic regulators, reduce the risk of and help heal ischemic injuries in animal models.

The microstructured elastomeric substrates are constructed as a pair of mirror-symmetric, tapered microrods with opposing tips separated by a small distance on the surface of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).Technology Overview:Recent advances in materials that are surface plasmon resonators and responsive to external stimuli have advanced the development of high-end optical devices, such as- active optical components;- high resolution displays; and- multiplexed holograms.​In particular, materials that change their properties based on how much they are stretched or compressed are effective at integrating optical and mechanical functionalities.Current state-of-the-art surface plasmon resonators are not sensitive enough to detect small mechanical deformations needed for the most common applications.  This technology solves the problem by locally increasing the deformations at the resonator, which effectively makes the resonator more sensitive to small deformations.The resonator consists of a lattice of rods embedded in an elastomer positioned between the tips of two tapered rods. As the two rods are pressed together or brought apart, they deform the lattice. Since the metal components are incompressible relative to the elastomer, the elastomer experiences almost all the applied deformation, significantly increasing its strain.This amplification can be tuned to a desired value by altering the geometry of the metal-elastomer lattice. The result is a highly sensitive optical sensor or actuator that can detect or be manipulated by externally applied deformations.Advantages:10x greater stain sensitivity than other state-of-the-art stretchable surface plasmon lattice techniques.Tunable strain amplificationMaterial flexibilityApplications:Strain gaugesOptical lensesHologramsDisplaysTop Figure: A schematic of the fabrication process of the lattice using electron beam lithography (EBL) and elastomer (PDMS) casting.

University of Pennsylvania,Self-healing cellular metals,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/36950,"A unique structural material composed of cellular metals that can heal; a property useful for recovery of material and strength along the path(s) of stress in the structural member.Problem:There is an increasing demand for greater reliability and longevity in load-bearing structures. Often failure of these structures could endanger lives and are increasingly too costly to repair. Additionally, additive manufacturing has enabled parts with complex shapes, but repairing these parts is very difficult using conventional technologies. There has always been a need and a vision of the future which includes structures with the ability to heal. Research efforts in healing materials have been largely based on polymeric and ceramic based composites with very little discussion of metallic-based healing materials.Solution:This material is a new class of metallic structural members that:1. can be healed at room temperature in response to catastrophic failure;2. strengthen areas that experience loads near their yield to prevent future failure; or3. modulate the stiffness of structural member.These capabilities can be built into a new or currently used structural member or developed as a repair process where they member is removed, healed, and reinstalled.The healing and reinforcing properties are enabled by a cellular metal infiltrated with an electrolyte. Upon applying a voltage to the metal, additional metal is electroplated to heal or strengthen the desired area. The target area and healing capability can be controlled using a tunable insulating coating on the conductive metal. The cellular nature of the structural member is required and facilitates metal transport from other areas of the material to the area that needs reinforcement, thus, enabling a faster mass-transport process at room temperature.Technology Overview:This healing cellular metal is a new structural material that can continuously self-repair cracks and redistribute cellular materials within itself at room temperature.

University of Pennsylvania,Multi-Channel Photodynamic Therapy Light Dosimetry System,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/36602,"PDT dosimetry instrument and system capable of measuring light fluency rate, reactive oxygen species, and photosensitizer concentration simultaneously at multiple sites and allowing to adjust the PDT dose in real-time during treatment.Technology Overview:Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment modality that is often used during surgeries to eradicate remaining cancer cells. PDT utilizes a drug - photosensitizer (PS) which becomes activated when exposed to a specific wavelength of light and produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that destroys adjacent cancer cells. PDT has been approved by FDA for treatment of several types of cancers and is being tested in a number of clinical trials for treatment of brain, skin, prostate, cervix, and peritoneal cavity malignancies.Dosing PDT is a critical aspect of the treatment - inadequate treatment dose may lead to residual cancer cells, while excessive doses may result in severe damage to the tissue leading to burns, swelling, pain, and scarring. Effective PDT dose depends on multiple factors such as local PS dose, tissue optical properties, oxygenation level, photobleaching, absorption and scattering of light, hemoglobin levels, damage to the tissue by surgery which are all dynamic. In addition, there is significant inter- and intra-patient variability in the PS pharmacokinetics, tissue optical properties, and local tissue oxygenation. Thus, there is a critical need for reliable dose metrics which would allow to deliver optimum PDT dose to treated tissues.Dr. Timothy Zhu of Penn Medicine has developed PDT device and system which measures light fluence rate, PS concentration, and tumor blood flow. This approach allows for the calculation of local ROS concentration for accurate prediction of PDT outcome and dose adjustment. The inventor demonstrated the utility of the device in clinical settings using photofrin-mediated PDT assessing ROS levels simultaneously at multiple sites in real time.Advantages:Improved PDT treatment outcome through real-time adjustment of PDT doseSimultaneous reading from multiple channels (up to 16)Entire spectrum light measurementsAssessment of local light fluency, PS concentration and created ROSApplications:Measurement and adjustment of PDT dose at up to 16 sitesStage of Development:Clinical human data on photofrin-mediated PDT in pleural cavityTissue simulating phantoms and animal dataIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Ong, YH et al.Phys Med Biol. 2017 Dec 29;63(1): 015031.Qiu, H et al.Photochem Photobiol. 2017 Jul;93(4): 1115.Sheng, T et al.Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng. 2019 Feb;10860.Sheng, T et al.Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng. 2019 Feb;10861.Ony, YH et al.Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng. 2018 Feb;10476.Case ID:19-8830-tpNCSWeb Published:10/11/2019Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/36602"
University of Pennsylvania,VerroTouch: Tactile augmentation for robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39291,"Providing tactile and audio feedback during robotic surgery produces an immersive experience for surgeons that can lead to safer and more efficient procedures.Technology Overview:Robotic systems allow surgeons to carry out minimally invasive procedures using remote hand controls to guide surgical instruments. While video feeds provide visual access to the surgical site, the surgeon lacks the important tactile cues that are available during conventional surgery.The sense of touch, or haptic sensation, is invaluable in a surgeon’s interaction with tools and patient tissue. However, transferring this information to the operator of a robotic system is a challenging technical problem; thus, commercially available surgical robot controllers rarely provide any haptic feedback. In the few cases where haptic feedback does exist, the technology is generally imprecise, noisy, and slow.Existing robotic surgery systems can be made more immersive through the incorporation of VerroTouch technology. Any rigid-arm robotic system can be equipped with this technology to provide tactile and audio sensations that let the surgeon perceive the strength and type of surgical tool contact.VerroTouch provides adjustable, crisp, lag-free feedback without the need for specialized goggles or additional handles. When asked to complete a series of dry-lab tasks using a robotic surgery system outfitted with this technology, 95% of surgeons preferred the addition of vibrational feedback, saying it made them more aware of instrument contacts. Surgeons also respond positively to auditory feedback, which has the potential to enhance procedural and ambient awareness for the entire operating room staff.Overall this technology promises to accelerate surgeon learning and could lead to safer procedures for patients.Advantages:Immersive, crisp, and natural feedback that does not interfere with robot operationAudio and tactile feedback exist even when visual cues are obstructedEnhances the awareness of surgeons and increases training efficiencyApplications:Enhances procedural awareness in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgeryTraining tool for robotic surgeonsStage of Development:Bench PrototypeIntellectual Property:US9,333,039KR20127023470Reference Media:Ted Talk on the Technology of TouchBark, K. et al.;Surg Endosc, 2013 Feb, 27(12): 656Koehn & Kuchenbecker;Surg Endosc, 2015 Oct, 29(10): 2970Desired Partnerships:LicenseCase ID:W5395-tpNCSWeb Published:3/17/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39291"

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia were the 7th and 10th most diagnosed cancers in the US, respectively. New therapeutics for relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies are needed as currently, there is no clinical standard of care for relapse of every type of hematologic malignancy.The Robertson group has developed a small molecule therapeutic for hematologic malignancies that inhibit a key cancer cell signaling pathway, causing cell death. This small molecule therapeutic has increased inhibitory action on cancer cells and decreased toxicity to healthy cells as compared to existing treatments.

University of Pennsylvania,Therapeutic for Type 2 Diabetes and Other Obesity-Related Metabolic Disorders,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/35906,"Obesity is associated with buildup of fat within the cells of the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle. Intracellular fat accumulation leads to impairment in the ability of these cells to absorb glucose from the blood in response to insulin, called insulin resistance. However, the linkage between intracellular fat accumulation and insulin resistance is poorly understood. This invention has defined the upstream connection between fat accumulation in muscle cells and insulin resistance defining  a new candidate target strategy for the treatment of obesity-related metabolic disorders.Technology Overview:Obesity is driving a dramatic increase in insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes), fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular disease. Obese individuals have intracellular lipid (fat) accumulation within the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle; organs which normally are responsible for absorbing glucose from the blood in response to insulin. Intracellular lipid accumulation in these tissues impairs the response to insulin, leading to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The elusive connection between intracellular lipid accumulation and insulin resistance has been poorly understood, and thus, there are currently no therapeutics that target both the tissue toxicity downstream of lipid buildup and insulin resistance. This invention has identified a potential therapy.Dr. Kelly and his colleagues developed a small molecule therapeutic that inhibits intracellular lipid accumulation in the liver and skeletal muscle while also reducing insulin resistance. This effect occurs by inhibiting the transcription factor MondoA.Inhibition of MondoA has the potential reduce both the end-organ lipid toxicity and insulin resistance driven by obesity and type 2 diabetes.

University of Pennsylvania,Stapled Peptide Therapeutic for the Treatment of Herpes Ocular Keratitis,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/35877,"A topically administered stapled peptide prevents Herpes Simplex Virus-1 DNA replication for improved treatment of Herpes Ocular Keratitis.Technology Overview:Nearly two thirds of the world population is infected with Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). Following initial infection, recurrent activation along the ophthalmic branch of the cranial trigeminal nerve can lead to Herpes Ocular Keratitis (HK), the leading cause of corneal blindness in the US and in the world.The gold standard for treatment of HK is acyclovir (ACV), a drug that targets viral thymidine kinase (TK). While this drug remains effective against oral and genital herpes, there is an emergence of ACV-resistant HK infections caused by mutations in the HSV-1 TK gene, and a need for therapies against alternative HSV-1 targets.Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a stapled α-helical peptide for the treatment of HK. This stabilized peptide mimics the C-terminal α-helix of HSV-1 DNA polymerase to block interaction between the polymerase and the HSV-1 processivity factor (PF).

University of Pennsylvania,The g3mclass Software for Multiclass Disease Diagnosis and Reporting.,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/35400,"Diagnostic software to stratify patients on biomarkers and therapeutic targets.Problem:Targeted therapy has revolutionized the treatment of cancer. The efficacy of such therapy is highly dependent on target levels that may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged in the tumor compared to healthy tissue. In clinical practice, the target’s status may be tested through methods such as immunohistochemistry (IHC), which relies on a trained professional to group samples using an arbitrary cutoff. Such a semi-quantitative approach may lead to over-/under- estimation of the target expression and ineffective health interventions. Molecular assays can measure multiple biomarkers but lag in multiclass diagnostic capabilities.Solution:The inventor developed an original software that uses tissue biomarkers and rigorous statistical analysis to classify patients by target expression with speed and precision.Advantages:Multiclass automated classification as opposed to conventional binary classificationHigh diagnostic performance in single-plex and multi-plex formatsInput from various platforms used for biomarker analysisThe methodology can be easily applied to other biomarkers (proteins and metabolites)The software has diverse applications including neurology, immunology, and metabolic diseasesThe applications could be extended to animal healthThe g3mclass-assisted autoclassification on ERBB2 mRNA.

University of Pennsylvania,Automated Micro-Particle Robotic Swarm for the Chemical and Mechanical Removal of Biofilms,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/35281,"Wirelessly activated iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) forming micro-robots that chemically and mechanically remove biofilms with high precision and efficacy by magnetic control.Technology Overview:Biofilms are extremely difficult to eliminate. They are made up of bacterial cells encapsulated in a protective, sticky matrix that helps them to firmly attach to a variety of surfaces, which ultimately lead to infections, biofouling, and biocorrosion. Biofilms are often resistant to traditional antibacterial treatments so removing them is an important challenge.Most current strategies for treating biofilms rely on antimicrobials (e.g. antibiotics), which have been shown to be ineffective due to antibiotics’ inability to penetrate or break down the structure of biofilm. Therefore, new methods for biofilm treatment and removal are required.Dr. Koo, along with his collaborators, have developed a novel approach to eliminate biofilm which utilizes Catalytic Antimicrobial Robots (CARs) built with IONPs. CARs were designed to tackle all facets of biofilm resistance by simultaneously degrading the protective matrix, killing the embedded bacteria, and physically removing the biodegraded products.Activated IONPs are targeted to and through biofilms with submicrometer precision using a magnetic field, wherein they aggregate to form CARs. Upon contact with the biofilm, CARs produce bio-actives which kill bacteria and degrade the protective matrix; while in parallel, CARs mechanically remove the biodegraded biofilm material. The use of the CARs alone, or in combination with known methods, offers increased potential for full biofilm removal and reduction of contamination.Advantages:Can remove biofilms from hard to access small areasWireless technologyPrecise and automated complete removal of biofilmRetrievable after usageTunable technology; can be fashioned into various shapes and forms depending on the needApplications:Medical device companies, cleaning device companies, health systems, and food manufacturers who need effective tools for controlling biofilm infections will use our automated micro-particle robotic swarm for the degradation and removal of biofilmsStage of Development:Reduction to practiceIntellectual Property:ZA2021/04331IN479834US, EP, MX, CN, KR, CA, JP, BR, IL, AU PatentsPendingReference Media:Hwang G, et al.,Science Robotics, 2019 Apr 24; 4(29): eaaw2388Baillie, KUPenn Today 2019 Apr 24Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:19-8727-tpNCSWeb Published:8/1/2019Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/35281"
University of Pennsylvania,Therapy Overcoming Resistance of Refractory Prostate Cancer,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/34978,"Inhibition of cyclin-dependent-kinase 7 (CDK7) for treatment of refractory castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) through reduction of androgen receptor transcriptional activity.Technology Overview:Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy, and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men of the western world. While effective therapies exist for clinically localized prostate cancer, progression to metastatic CRPC is essentially incurable. The Androgen receptor (AR) is the most frequent driver of resistance mechanism in CRPC patients.Dr. Asangani and his team at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a new approach for the treatment of CRPC by blocking AR signaling at the transcriptional level. The researchers found that AR transcriptional activity relies on activation through a “phosphoswitch” catalyzed by CDK7.CDK7 phosphorylates the co-activator MED1 which forms a complex with AR leading to AR-mediated gene transcription. Inhibition of CDK7 disrupts the formation of this MED1-AR complex and blocks AR function. This approach allows to overcome several resistance mechanisms including AR amplification, mutation, and de novo androgen synthesis.Advantages:Treatment overcoming resistance of CRPCApplications:Treatment of advanced prostate cancerTreatment of advanced prostate cancer refractory to second generation anti-androgensPotential therapy for other hormonally driven cancersStage of Development:In vivo data using genetic and pharmacologic inhibitionIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Rasool, R et al.;Cancer Discov 2019 Nov 9(11): 1538.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:19-8898-tpNCSWeb Published:7/15/2019Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/34978"
University of Pennsylvania,Bifurcation-based embodied logic and autonomous actuation,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38476,"A stimuli-responsive self-actuating 3D-printed material capable of performing complex timed functions and simple logical operations in response to multiple stimuli.Technology Overview:Mechanical systems with nonlinear properties are known to be highly sensitive to structural changes, particularly at geometric branch points. Such stimuli-responsive materials are useful for creating active materials with applications in microfluidics, medical devices, and robotics. However, available systems exhibit variable functionality due to high sensitivity to stimuli and low controllability of structural changes. Current technologies require rigid electronics, wires, control systems, or human intervention for proper function, which limits their use in many environments.The technology is a stimuli-responsive anisotropic composite material that autonomously and reversibly changes structure upon contact with a defined trigger. The actuation is driven by the release of internal stresses accumulated due to the response of the anisotropic material to the external stimuli. The functionality of the material is coupled with Finite Element Analysis calculations to determine the optimal geometry for desired functions. The result is a self-powered device capable of performing simple logical operations and precisely timed resettable movements and is scalable from microscopic to building-size scales.Advantages:Combined structural and functional control over the materialThe structure-material combination is a sensor, actuator, and device all in oneNo need for external power or control systemsAutonomously and reversibly changes structureOptimizable geometry for particular tasks.Applications:Self-powered remote single-task devicesBiomedical devices, particularly for drug deliverySoft roboticsDeployable structuresStage of Development:Prototypes developed using 3D printed PDMS/fiberglass composites and hydrogels with cellulose fibersPrototype devices were developed that take advantage of simple Boolean logic and timed actuation.

University of Pennsylvania,Broad Non-Typeable Haemophilus Influenzae Vaccine,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/35201,"Problem:Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) colonizes in the upper respiratory tract causing a wide variety of diseases, including otitis media, conjunctivitis, sinusitis, pneumonia, and meningitis. H. influenzae strains are classified into 6 serotypes depending on antibody specificity to the bacterial capsule. There is also a genetically diverse group of strains that do not express a capsule, termed non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi). NTHi is now one of the leading causes of otitis media in children and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. Current efforts in NTHi vaccine development focus on generating antibodies against surface antigens, but have had limited success due to the antigenic diversity among NTHi strains.Solution:Dr. Hao Shen discovered that a cellular response from CD4 T-cells (Th17) is the required immune mechanism of protection against NTHi lung infections and is broadly protective against different NTHi strains, unlike antibody responses that are highly strain specific.Drs. Hao Shen and Brian Akerley discussed screening for conserved NTHi antigens recognized by T-cells, and Dr. Akerley developed a list of conserved NTHi proteins based on published genomic data as potential target antigens. Dr. Shen screened these proteins and identified conserved protein antigens that are recognized by Th17 during NTHi infection, including protein antigens 0259 and 0264 that are conserved among 97% of NTHi strains.Dr. Shen showed that immunization with protein antigens 0259 and 0264 induce antigen-specific Th17 cellular responses that recognize different NTHi strains and protect against the lung infection. Therefore, immunization with these protein antigens provide broad protection against infections by different NTHi strains.Advantages:Broadly protective against different strains of NTHi; not limited to strain-specific surface antigensCan be effectively administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, or intravenouslyApplications:Non-typeable H. influenzae vaccineProtective against influenza co-infectionsStage of Development:Target identifiedPreclinical proof of conceptIntellectual Property:US11,357,845Reference Media:Li, Wenchao et al.;Proc Natl Academ Sci USA 2018 July; 115(30); E7149.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:19-8990-tpNCSWeb Published:7/30/2019Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/35201"
University of Pennsylvania,A Point-of-Care Fentanyl Test Capable of Detecting ≥1 ng/ml Fentanyl,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/34834,"Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid agonist that is almost 50-100 times more potent than morphine, and illicit fentanyl is the fastest growing overdose substance in the United States. Rapid identification of fentanyl in suspected overdose patients is critical for prompt treatment. This invention describes an easy to use point-of-care test to rapidly identify fentanyl in patient urine or on objects to detect the illicit transportation of fentanyl.Solution:This technology is a competitive lateral flow immunoassay test strip capable of acting as a point-of- care (POC) diagnostic to provide rapid ‘on-site’ detection of ≥1 ng/ml fentanyl in a nonlaboratory settings.Unlike other lateral flow assays to detect fentanyl, the described invention is the first lateral flow assay with cutoff at the clinical meaningful level of 1 ng/ml. The unique characteristics of the invention enabling this level of sensitivity compared to existing assays are covered by a US provisional patent application and may be shared under a CDA.Problem:In 112 adults that died of intravenous fentanyl overdose, the fentanyl concentrations in the urine averaged 3.9 ng/mL. Currently, commercially available point-of-care fentanyl tests fail to detect the presence of fentanyl if it is below 10 ng/ml. Sensitive fentanyl detection is essential for properly treating overdose victims, and transporting overdose patients to a hospital. The reliance on current clinical fentanyl tests significantly delays proper intervention.Advantages:10x greater sensitivity than current commercially available point-of-care fentanyl testsFast results and easy to useApplications:Identification of trace amounts of fentanyl on shipments/packages to screen for the illicit transportation of fentanylCan be used in the field, emergency vehicles, or emergency rooms to rapidly identify individuals with fentanyl overdoseIndividual results of clinical urine samples tested using the fentanyl strip and the LC-MS/MS method. Y-axis is fentanyl equivalent concentration as determined by the LC-MS/MS method, calculated as (LC-MS/MS fentanyl + LC-MS/MS norfentanyl x 0.08).To validate the performance of the fentanyl strip, two groups of clinical urine samples were tested using both the fentanyl strip and an LC-MS/MS method validated according to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) standards. Using the LC-MS/MS as gold standard method with 1 ng/mL fentanyl or 10 ng/mL norfentanyl as cutoffs, the clinical sensitivity of the fentanyl strip is calculated to be 100% (95% confidence interval (CI) 75.8-100%), and the clinical specificity is 99.5% (95% CI 97.3-99.9%). The incidence of fentanyl/norfentanyl-positivity in this ED population is 5.5%. The positive and negative predictive values (95% CI) of the fentanyl strip test are 92.3% (66.7-98.6%) and 100% (98.2-100%) respectively.Stage of Development:Bench prototypeIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:19-9020-tpNCSWeb Published:7/10/2019Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/34834"
University of Pennsylvania,Multipoint Injection Technology for Efficient Intracerebral Drug Delivery,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/37169,"Multipoint injection technology improves therapeutic coverage and infusion rate, reduces the number of injections required and minimizes surgical time.Technology Overview:The use of adeno-associated virus (AAV) for therapeutic gene transfer to the brain has reached the clinical stage and is being used for treatment of diseases of the brain, such as Parkinson’s Disease, where the therapeutic target can be any superficial or deep brain structure. Thus far, AAV has been delivered to the brain via injection with a single cannula. Initial trials have shown inefficient and sub-therapeutic dosage in one injection, requiring serial injections to three separate areas of the putamen, lengthening and complicating the surgical procedure.In a collaboration between the University of Pennsylvania and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Dr. Vitale and Dr. Gonzalez-Alegre have developed an intracerebral drug delivery system that consists of three flexible, retractable silicone microcannulas housed within a single central catheter. This device delivers AAV to the full putamen through a single trajectory with double the infusion rate. This reduces the number of injections and minimizes surgical time.The flexible silicone microcannulas minimize acute trauma and bleeding compared with conventional metal cannulas. The technology is expected to be compatible with treatment of other brain regions using any fluid-based drug delivery system, such as chemotherapeutic agents for glioblastoma.Advantages:3x volume infused with a single injectionReduced length, cost and risk of surgical procedureCompatible with MRI and current surgical guidance workflowsCan be approved by the FDA via 510k pathway as class II medical deviceApplications:Delivery of gene therapiesDelivery of other fluid-based therapies to different areas of the brainBrain electrical activity recording for intraoperative diagnostic monitoringMultipoint Injection Technology (MINT) is a gene therapy delivery system that includes 3 retractable cannulas within a single catheter to reduce the number of injections required to achieve therapeutic dosage as well as minimize surgical time necessary to deliver therapy.Stage of Development:Bench prototype and some preclinical testingIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingEuropean PatentPendingReference Media :Prezelski, K et al.;Front Med Technol 2021 Oct 14, 3: 725844Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:18-8489-tpNCSWeb Published:11/14/2019Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/37169"
University of Pennsylvania,Guidance Device for Optimized Directional Placement of Chest Tubes,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/34676,"A plastic device to guide directional placement of chest tubes. Unlike chest tube placement without guidance when using kelly clamps for stability, the chest tube guidance device places the tube in its intended intrathoracic direction correctly in the first instance, thereby avoiding repeat procedures and injury.Technology Overview:Drainage of air or fluid/blood accumulating in the pleural or chest cavity is required 5,000-10,000 times per year in the fields of trauma surgery, cardiaothoracic surgery, and emergency medicine. This is achieved through insertion of a chest tube into the thoracic cavity, with the tube ideally directed towards the apex of the lung to drain air, or towards the base to drain fluid or blood and to minimize tissue damage and reduce blood clots. However, this position is often not achieved because surgeons are blind to the motion of the chest tube once the tube is inside the thoracic cavity.Clinicians often use kelly clamps to stabilize the tube, but this directing force is limited to the incision site. When there is misplacement of a chest tube, an additional chest tube must be placed and in some cases major surgery is required to remove blood clots. This leads to increased procedures, morbidity/mortality and costs.To overcome these challenges, an L-shaped plastic chest tube introducer can be used to guide the chest tube into an optimal placement once inside the chest without interacting with the lungs and other tissues. The chest tube guidance device consists of an inner compartment and an external support. Once the guidance device is inserted, the inner component is removed and replaced with the chest tube, which is advanced and guided towards its intended direction inside the chest.The guidance device consists of a grip with handles (for the physician to direct chest tube placement while inside the intrathoracic cavity) and the attached plastic tube with inner and outer compartments.Advantages:Higher confidence when placing chest tubesReduced need for multiple tube placements and, in some cases, surgery to repair damageLess costly (when accounting for multiple placements and/or surgery)Application:Introducing chest tubes into the bodyStage of Development:Computer models of the device have been generatedSterile devices and clinical trials are in developmentIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:18-8703-tpNCSWeb Published:6/25/2019Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/34676"
University of Pennsylvania,A method for highly selective nucleic acid enrichment for sensitive detection of mutations in cancer and genectic conditions.,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38495,"This technology increases the fraction of clinically relevant, rare mutant alleles (DNA and/or RNA) to enable high sensitivity detection with common downstream methods such as capped (XNA or PNA) PCR, ddPCR, and sequencing.Problem:Liquid biopsy is a simple, minimally invasive, rapidly developing diagnostic method to analyze cell-free nucleic acid fragments in body fluids to obtain critical information on patient health and disease status, enable personalized therapy, and replace invasive methods such as tissue biopsy.The sensitivity of available tests is, however, insufficient for patients at early disease stage and for cancer screening. Detection of alleles that contain critical clinical information is challenged by their very low concentrations and sequence homologies with abundant wildtype nucleic acids. This invention comprises of a high efficiency assay that reduces the concentrations of wildtype nucleic acids, DNA and/or RNA, and increases the fraction of clinically-relevant mutant alleles (DNA and/or RNA) to enable their downstream detection by a variety of methods.Solution:This invention utilizes DNA-guided Argonaute (Ago) endonuclease that cleaves guide-complementary DNA and RNA with single nucleotide precision, greatly increasing the fractions of clinically-relevant rare alleles in a patient sample to enhance the sensitivity of downstream detection methods such as drop digital PCR, sequencing, and clamped (e.g., XNA and PNA) enzymatic amplification, enabling detection of low-frequency (0.01%) mutant alleles.This invention has many advantages over competing technologies such as CRISPR Cas9-based, as Ago does not require targets to contain any specific (PAM-like) motifs; is a multi-turnover enzyme; cleaves ssDNA, dsDNA, and RNA targets in a single assay; is DNA-guided (less expensive and more stable than RNA guides), and operates at elevated temperatures, providing high selectivity and compatibility with polymerases.Advantages:Improves sensitivity of downstream detection and genotyping methodsCapable of enriching both DNA and RNA alleles in the same assayVersatile: does not require targets to contain specific (PAM-like) motifsTurnover enzymes:  reduced enzyme consumptionHighly specific: resolves single nucleotide differences between sequences.Can be used as standalone kit for qualitative and quantitative assay to enrich rare sequences or integrated with existing downstream amplification such as capped (RT-) PCR/LAMP and/or sequencing.Amenable for incorporation into point of care devicesApplications:Increase the effectiveness and sensitivity of liquid biopsiesEnable detection of specific genetic materials (e.g., mutations associated with various types of cancers and fetal disorders; and strains of pathogensStage of Development:Reduction to practiceIn a proof of concept experiments, this invention enabled detection of cancer-related cell free alleles at fractions as low as 0.1% in blood samples from pancreatic cancer patients, in excellent agreement with tissue biopsy genotyping.Intellectual Property:PatentPendingReferences:Song et al.,Nucleic Acids Research 2020 Feb, 48(4): e19Swarts et al.Nucleic Acids Res, 2015, May 26, 43(10):5120.Sheng et al.Proc Natl Acad Sci, 2014 Jan 14, 111(2):652.Makarova et al.Biol Direct. 2009 Aug 25, 4:29.Desired Partnerships:LicensingCo-developmentCase ID:18-8416-tpNCSWeb Published:2/7/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38495"
University of Pennsylvania,Camera Catheter for Gene Therapy Delivery and Therapeutic Interventions in the Subarachnoid Space,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/34615,"Minimally invasive micro-catheter with an integrated camera (MIMIC) to reach suboccipital space of the cisterna magna via lumbar puncture for drug and gene-therapy delivery to the brainProblem:Open surgery is the standard of care for access to a diseased brain and spinal cord, but such surgeries are invasive, associated with significant morbidity, and can require long recovery times.Recent advances in gene therapy hold the potential to cure devastating neurological diseases. In order to be effective, circumvention of the blood brain barrier (BBB) is required for gene therapy treatment of neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and glycogen storage diseases. One method to bypass the BBB is to place a needle via suboccipital puncture into the cisterna magna, a relatively large subarachnoid space located in the cranial vault. However, there is hesitation to utilize this technique due to potential for catastrophic injury to the brain and spinal cord.Solution:Bryan Pukenas, M.D., at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, has developed a minimally invasive catheter that enables direct access for focal delivery of gene therapy vectors to the suboccipital space of the cranial vault in a minimally invasive manner.Traditionally, catheters are navigated using fluoroscopic guidance.  However, navigating catheters with only fluoroscopic guidance in the spinal canal poses significant risk of spinal cord or nerve injury since one cannot see these structures using this method. In contrast, the MIMIC catheter utilizes an embedded micro-camera permitting real-time visualization of the spinal canal contents during catheter navigation and gives operators the ability to avoid vital structures like the spinal cord and nerves as the catheter is directed from the lumbar canal to the cranial vault.In addition to increased safety and simplicity, this approach is expected to reduce the amount of required gene vector material by 10-100 fold since gene transduction is much more efficient when delivered into the cisterna magna. The technology will change the procedure of gene therapy delivery to the brain from an inpatient surgery performed by an interventionalist /neurosurgeon to an outpatient procedure.Gene therapy may become accessible for patients who otherwise would not clinically qualify for gene therapy treatment due to risks associated with surgery and post-surgical care. Moreover, the cost of care will be dramatically reduced by moving towards an outpatient model and decreasing the amount of vector required for treatment.This invention has received over $90,000 in support from the Penn Medical Device Accelerator. The device has been tested in bench top spine models and a human cadaver.

University of Pennsylvania,Targeting the Retinoic Acid Pathway to Bolster Immunotherapy,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/34482,"A strategy to increase the effect of immune checkpoint blockade by targeting retinoic acid signaling in immunosuppressive solid tumors.Technology Overview:Sarcomas are solid tumors with more than 70 rare and often fatal subtypes. Typical survival rates are under 15% over 5 years. Sarcomas can prevent the formation of tumor-killing cells by eluding immune detection, a process termed immunosuppression. These tumors are largely resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), a cancer immunotherapy which promotes the formation of tumor-killing cells. More effective strategies to target sarcomas are needed.Recently, Dr. Haldar and his team have found that sarcomas can suppress the immune system through the secretion of retinoic acid (RA), a molecule which favors the formation of immune cells unable to detect tumors. Their latest findings demonstrate that inhibiting the RA pathway in sarcomas triggers a tumor rejection response by directly boosting the formation of tumor-detecting immune cells.Dr. Haldar’s team has developed a combination therapy to bolster existing immunotherapy against sarcomas that produce high levels of RA. Their protocol combines conventional ICB therapy with molecules that block RA signaling in tumors, an approach found to greatly reduce the size and weight of tumors in mice (see figure). This strategy could enhance survival rates and quality of life for patients with sarcoma.Advantages:Renders immunotherapy efficient against unresponsive sarcoma subtypesCould potentiate other existing treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapyCould extend lifespan and increase quality of life of affected patientsApplications:Therapy against sarcomas resistant to immunotherapyPromising treatment against other cancer types using the RA pathwayBlocking retinoic acid (RA) signaling with RA receptor blocker BMS493 potentiates immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) agent anti-PD1 antibody (aPD1) to reduce tumor size in mice.

University of Pennsylvania,Enhancing the Efficacy of Tumor Immunotherapy by Targeting Endothelin Receptor B,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/34427,"Antagonism of Endothelin Receptor B (ETRB) increases intratumoral T cell homing to tumors and enables tumor response to otherwise ineffective immunotherapyProblem:In spite of generating a tangible antitumor cellular immune response in peripheral blood, tumor vaccines have proven largely ineffective for treatment of solid tumors. The success of immune therapy partly depends on the ability of effector cells to infiltrate tumors which in turn is dependent on tumor microenvironment.T cell trafficking through lymphoid organs and peripheral tissues is tightly controlled through endothelial addressing signals regulating homing, adhesion and transendothelial migration. Endothelium provides a barrier that prevents T cell infiltration, and thus, there is a need for new pharmacologic intervention to improve cancer immunotherapy without increasing systemic inflammation.Solution:Dr. Coukos and his team at Penn have developed methods of treating and enhancing efficacy of immunotherapy for a solid tumor by modulating the expression or activity of effector proteins such as ETRB, ET-1, ICAM-1 to guide T-cells to the tumor cells. They have shown that ETBR signaling blocks T cell adhesion to endothelium and ETBR blockade restored adhesion of T cells in vitro and markedly increased T cell homing to tumors. In addition, the endothelial molecular signature which includes ETBR, could assist in the selection of patients for whom ETBR blockade may enhance immunotherapy.Advantages:Increase in anti-tumor immune responseApplications:Adjuvant therapy to tumor vaccinesStage of Development:In vivo dataIntellectual Property:US9,289,426US10,174,120Reference Media:Kandalaft, LE et al.;Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Jul 15;15(14): 4521.Buckanovich,RJ et al.;Nat Med. 2008 Jan;14(1):28.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCase ID:S4136-tpNCSWeb Published:5/29/2019Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/34427"
University of Pennsylvania,MicroRNA Mimics for the Treatment of Pneumonia,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/32592,"miR302-mimic is a therapeutic compound that accelerates regeneration of alveolar epithelial cells for treatment of bacterial pneumonia. Unlike standard treatment with antibiotics, which eliminate only the bacterial infection, this product would accelerate healing of the lungs to improve patient recovery time and could be given in conjunction with antibiotics.Technology Overview:Bacterial pneumonia is a leading cause of serious infection and death in children and the elderly worldwide. Even with antibiotic treatment, patients may become severely ill and require hospitalization and intensive care, followed by a prolonged recovery period. Recovery requires both eradication of the bacterial infection as well as repair to alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) caused by the infection. Failure to repair this damage increases susceptibility to recurring infection and increases the risk of development of chronic and progressive lung diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.Researchers in the laboratory of Dr. Hao Shen at the University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with Dr. Ying Tian at Temple University identified that increased expression of microRNA (miRNA) from the miR302 family coincided with regeneration of AECs. miRNA-mimics are double-stranded RNA molecules intended to “mimic” native miRNAs. The Shen Lab found that administration of miR302-mimics to mice infected with bacterial pneumonia improves AEC regeneration and lung function, and enhances mouse recovery and survival.Addition of exogenous miR302 by miRNA mimics increases proliferation of lung progenitor cells and accelerates the repair of lung injury, which is expected to shorten patient recovery times. miR302-mimics could potentially be administered in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy to improve patient outcomes. This approach may also provide long-term benefits by reducing severe chronic pathological conditions, such as COPD, which are associated with repeated lung infections, injuries and defects in tissue regeneration.Advantages:Speeds regeneration of AECsExpected to reduce patient recovery time from bacterial pneumoniaMay accelerate treatment of injuries to lungs resulting from other causesApplications:Treatment of injured lungsTreatment of bacterial pneumoniaMice treated with miR302 show improved rates of survival (left) and faster recovery of body weight (right) than control mice.

University of Pennsylvania,Application of human 3D brain organoids in regenerative medicine and drug testing,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39103,"Problem:Current drug discovery strategies often utilize cell lines and animal models for compound development, drug screening, efficacy testing, and establishing dose-responses. However, such model systems are often limited, particularly for brain disorders and cancers.Traditional cell culture systems can unintentionally alter physiological properties of cells given the artificial 2D environment, while animal models are very costly and do not fully recapitulate human disorders or diseases, resulting in less efficient and expensive drug discovery. An improved high throughput model system is necessary that maintains fidelity to in vivo human physiological properties yet can be easily manipulated and tested.Solution:Dr. Song and colleagues have established human 3D brain organoid systems that closely resemble human development and have already been applied for modeling several brain disorders. Using a highly optimized protocol consisting of human stem cells, tissues or cancer cells, and miniaturized spinning bioreactors, 3D brain organoids can be synthesized that recapitulate in vivo properties, contain more functional and mature cells, and have increased yield, stability and survivability. These brain organoids have been utilized for understanding the underlying mechanism of the Zika virus, screening neuroprotective compounds, modeling glioblastoma and identifying personalized therapeutics.Technology Overview:The maintenance of cellular, mechanical and topographical cues in the 3D microenvironment enables enhanced in vitro modeling of brain cancer, and neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, to improve and accelerate the efficiency, safety, discovery and cost of drug screening for brain cancer and neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.(See image below for reference.) Overview of human 3D brain organoid generation and use in drug screening.Using human-derived cells (e.g., human stem cells, tissue, cancer cells)3D brain organoids are developed that recapitulate in vivo physiological properties. Applications for brain organoids includeevaluating brain development and disease modeling;use in cell therapy; andhigh throughput drug screening, where ultimately drug hits and validation willlead to the development of novel pharmacotherapies.Advantages:Improves efficiency and reduces costs of modeling brain disorders and cancers.Improves testing of personalized therapeutics and drug response.Maintains 3D brain-like cytoarchitecture that recapitulates and retains physiological properties compared to 2D cell lines.Applications:Test beds for drug screening and genomic manipulationModeling and understanding brain disease pathogenesisStage of Development:Reliable generation using miniaturized spinning bioreactorsApplied use for Zika virus (mechanism & screening of therapeutic compounds), and glioblastoma (screening personalized therapeutics)Reference Media:Qian, X et al.;Cell 2016 May 19, 165(5): 1238Qian, X et al.;Nat Protoc 2018 March, 13(3): 565Vissers, C et al.;Adv Drug Deliv Rev 2019 Aug, 148: 239.Desired Partnerships:Sponsored Research AgreementsCase ID:Song-Brain-OrganoidsWeb Published:3/6/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39103"
University of Pennsylvania,Portable Assay Platform for Detection of Single Molecules,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/32372,"A simple, inexpensive, and portable lateral flow assay platform that uses platinum nanoparticles to amplify signals and achieve single-molecule sensitivity.Technology Overview:Point-of-care (POC) diagnostics are able to provide rapid on-site results in non laboratory settings and play a key role in public health for rural and under-developed areas of the world. However, most traditional POC platforms are limited by low sensitivity and lack of quantification, and therefore cannot meet certain clinical needs. Traditional diagnostics often require expensive equipment, complex imaging, or laboratory expertise to operate, and therefore, cannot be used in low-resource settings.This technology is a simple, inexpensive, ultra-sensitive, and portable platinum nanoparticle-initiated bubbling digital assay (PNDA) platform for POC tests. A microfluidic array is decorated with antibodies for the target biomarker in close proximity to platinum nanoparticles, which catalyze the generation of oxygen microbubbles. The digital assay platform uses this “express bubbling” to transform and amplify the signal, thus enabling the detection of single molecules.A widely available handheld microscope (or smart phone accessory) can be used to perform a readout from the PNDA Chip. The PNDA technology can be incorporated into a lateral flow assay (LFA) to provide a quantitative distance-based test readout. The entire immunoassay process can be integrated on to the LFA to process a single drop of sample in one step.Advantages:Low cost through the use of common reagentsOne-step, simple assay procedureCan be used in non-laboratory environmentsHigh sensitivity (single-molecule level)Complex imaging and fluorescence are not requiredQuantitative outputApplications:Point-of-care and portable health diagnosticsSingle-molecule detectionChemical tests in non-laboratory settingsThe platinum nanoparticle-initiated bubbling digital assay (PNDA).

University of Pennsylvania,Reconfigurable colloid-crystal materials for fine control over particle motion,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/32351,"A nematic liquid crystal system functionalized with colloidal microbots.Problem:Particle motion is of great interest for designing materials that depend on the particle behavior to exhibit a specific functionality. Elastic colloids are useful for the development of functional materials for particle manipulation. Nematic liquid crystals are fluid, like liquids, but also have well-defined structural organization, like crystals.Embedding colloids in these materials provides strong control over the particle motion and ensures a smooth elastic energy field for the particles. Current techniques have similarly tried to alter the energy landscape for particles in colloid-nematic crystal systems, but fail to robustly control the particles, and either do not solicit a response or drastically change the crystal configuration.Solution:The researchers envision controllable, reconfigurable liquid/crystal systems. To achieve this innovation the inventors leverage surface features in boundary walls that cause unique boundary conditions that can control the movement and action of microbots within the system.

University of Pennsylvania,High Precision Bone Metastases and/or Fracture Identification From Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry Exams Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques.,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/35193,"Problem:Osteoporosis causes a reduction in bone density, which can result in bone fractures, particularly in the spine, forearms, and the hip. Osteoporosis does not present any symptoms, and yet it is estimated that more than 20 million people have this debilitating disease. Therefore, regular examination, especially in patients over the age of 65, is recommended.Diagnosis is typically done by bone density measurement using Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) examination. DEXA is currently considered to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Even with 50 million scans per year, a large portion of metastases and fractures remain unnoticed by radiologists. This can lead to increased treatment cost and morbidity downstream.Solution:Advances in computing have created numerous opportunities for artificial intelligence (AI) to solve clinically important imaging problems, with promising applications that would benefit patients. Most notably, AI outperformed radiologists in diagnosis of pneumonia from chest X-rays.The inventors developed an AI algorithm using random forest classifiers to assist radiologists in measuring bone mineral density. The algorithm can be implemented on current scanners. Experimental data shows improvement in sensitivity (77.8%), specificity (100%), and accuracy (98%) of lumbar bony metastasis detection, and improvement in sensitivity (61%), specificity (91%), and accuracy (85%) of lumbar fracture detection, which can reduce treatment cost and offer significant benefits to patients.Advantages:Can be easily and inexpensively installed and implemented on existing machines.High accuracy (98%), sensitivity (77.8%) and specificity (100%) in detecting bony metastases.High accuracy (85%) sensitivity (61%) and specificity (91%) in detecting factures.Can reduce cost of care by better identifying bony metastatic disease and/or fractures.Applications:Bone mineral density measurementBony metastasis and fracture detection from dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) examsStage of Development:Algorithm is fully developed to detect bony metastases and/or fractures in the spine.Proof of concept has been successfully established in-vivo in over two hundred patients.Inventors aim to expand the application to detect other bone diseases and conditions such as Paget’s disease in the spine.Investigators aim to optimize the method to detect metastases and/or fractures in other regions such as the hip.Intellectual Property:CopyrightReference Media:Mehta & Sebro;Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg 2019 May, 14(5): 903.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:19-8729-tpNCSWeb Published:7/29/2019Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/35193"

Conventional medical image registration can be time consuming and challenging for certain types of images. Therefore, new methods use deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks, which often employ training image datasets to learn informative image features. These techniques can improve the speed and accuracy of registration. However, in some cases training datasets are unavailable or do not accurately represent the image at hand.Solution:To overcome these challenges, this image registration algorithm uses deep learning methods to identify the appropriate spatial transformations required to align medical images. While other deep learning methods have relied on previously acquired training data, this method directly trains fully convolutional networks to independently estimate spatial transformations.To account for potentially large deformations between images, a multi-resolution strategy is adopted to jointly learn spatial transformations at different spatial resolutions. Because the registration of pairs of images also serves as a training procedure, the algorithm simultaneously optimizes and learns spatial transformations for the image registration.Advantages:Fast image registration (~200 ms per image pair)Improved image alignment compared to current state-of-the-art techniquesMulti-resolution registration strategy that accounts for deformations at different scalesApplications:Medically necessary imaging that requires fast image registrationLarge clinical research studies that require accurate image registration(a) A reference brain space defined by an individual brain image.

University of Pennsylvania,Automating the ABCDE Ventilator Bundle in the ICU: An app to facilitate implementation of the bundle and improve outcomes for mechanically ventilated patients.,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/31940,"This app provides automated, around-the-clock, patient screening for the both sedation and ventilator weaning. Real-time data on ABCD(E) documentation and performance is displayed on an electronic dashboard while timely alerts to mobile devices inform bedside providers.Problem:Mechanical ventilation [MV], while often necessary, can lead to a multitude of hospital-acquired conditions such as ICU-associated delirium, which has been shown to be strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates both while in the hospital and post-acute care. Further, MV is a prime target for improving both patient outcomes and cost savings, since MV is the single biggest determinant in ICU Length of Stay [LOS], the single greatest driver of cost for an inpatient admission.Current evidence shows that coordination between different care team disciplines to screen and conduct weaning trials can improve patient outcomes, but they are largely performed manually and on a set schedule, translating into many missed opportunities to improve those very outcomes.Solution:Dr. Fuchs and colleagues have created the ABCDE app to continuously screen patients based on data in the electronic health record and alert the care team upon the patient reaching clinical readiness for weaning from sedation and ventilation. This information plus delirium scoring and progress with exercise is displayed in real-time on an electronic dashboard for review by ICU teams and ICU leadership.Simultaneously, alerts are sent to the respiratory therapist [RT] and registered nurse [RN], who then coordinate weaning of both the ventilator and sedative medications collaboratively. The system also provides real-time insight into the status of patients for both clinicians and ICU administration assessing patient flow. Additionally, it can evaluate for missed opportunities in order to identify operational processes for optimization.A pilot study showed that the system reduced significantly time on mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. It is now implemented across the UPHS.Implementation of an automated screening system such as the ABCDE app addresses failures in timing and coordination between care team members and provides data-driven insights into ICU operations that current solutions do not address.Advantages:Automated screening conducted on a continuous basisNo manual initiation requiredAutomatic communication to all care team membersReports on historical trends for operational optimizationApplications:Integration into an EHR with ICU moduleStand-alone app for use in ICUsCoordination of RN and RT in performing ventilator and sedation weaning trialsReal-time patient status reportingHistorical reporting to identify missed opportunitiesStage of Development:Ready for licensingIntellectual Property:CopyrightReference Media:Girard, TD et al.;Lancet. 2008 Jan 12, 371(9607): 126Balas, MC et al.;Crit Care Nurse. 2012 Aug, 32(4): 15Desired Partnerships:LicenseCase ID:16-7668-tpNCSWeb Published:4/5/2019Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/31940"
University of Pennsylvania,Modified Polymer System for Improved Cartilage Repair,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/34378,"Improved cartilage repair via injectable modified polymers that target damaged tissues and enhance cellular responseProblem:Cartilage damage is one of the most common ailments in the aging population. Tissue damage, particularly cartilage damage, can occur due to traumatic injury, degeneration with time, and other soft tissue injuries. The inability of these to heal properly after an injury results in mechanical wear and altered mechanics in adjacent tissues. These degenerative changes leave the tissues vulnerable to damage, often leading to their failure.Solution:The invention is a system of modified polymers that target damaged tissues and improve their repair process. The polymer acts by sealing the damaged cartilage and creating an environment that facilitates tissue healing. Current treatments involve application of glues or polymers directly to the injury site but are not living, something that the technology presented here achieves by delivering polymers intraarticularly to specific tissues, recruiting cells and directing their response. This targeting mechanism leads to enhanced and efficient healing. Moreover, the material is also tunable and can promote cartilage formation or anti-inflammatory effects, allowing for a treatment plan that can be customized to the patient’s tissue damage.Advantages:Treatment can be customized to the patient and type of tissue damageEnhanced delivery of therapeuticsProvided via intraarticular injection or applied arthroscopically near the defectImproved cartilage repairAbility to seal damaged cartilage and restore proper fluid flowApplications:Injectable therapeuticIn conjunction with stem cells injections to improve delivery, repair and/or regenerationDamaged tissue removal treatments e.g. cartilage debridement, meniscectomyTissue repair treatmentsTop Figure: Cartilage defects can cause increased fluid flow and loss of matrix proteins, including proteoglycans. This leads to elevated strain levels in the adjacent tissues, leaving tissues susceptible to wear, and ultimately joint-wide OA.Bottom Figure: This technology has the potential to treat damaged tissues. The first option restores fluid flow with a barrier at the focal defect interface and reduces the rate of degeneration. The second option would promote cartilage repair. The third would direct cells to the defect, providing an anti-inflammatory benefit, and improving the healing process.

It has been shown in multiple species that the elevated level of GDF15 drives weight loss primarily by reducing total food intake.The increased level of GDF15 is also seen after a cancer therapy that often associates with nausea and emesis. It was only in 2017 when a receptor responsible for mediating the anorectic actions of GDF15 was identified. Hence, the hormone and its receptor are promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of disorders such as obesity, anorexia, and nausea associated with chemotherapy. Nausea from chemotherapy and morning sickness is difficult to manage and can be extremely debilitating and compromise individual quality of life.Solution:The inventors created non-naturally occurring peptides that can enhance or suppress the effects of the hormone GDF15. By targeting the hormone receptor, these compounds can be useful to treat obesity by ennhancing the action of the hormone and cachexia as well as nausea associated with chemotherapy or morning sickness by suppressing its expression.Advantages:New targets that will help the discovery of drug for treating obesity, cachexia, or nauseaCan be designed to target the specific site only avoiding brain penetrationPotential to increase quality of life for people suffering from obesity, cachexia, and nauseaApplications:Use as drug to treat obesity or cachexiaUse as drugs to overcome nausea associated with chemotherapy and morning sicknessStage of Development:Preclinical DiscoveryIntellectual Property:US,European,Canadian&AustralianPatents PendingDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:19-8758-tpNCSWeb Published:3/27/2019Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/31867"

In neurodegeneration PARP-1 causes cell death, while in cancer PARP-1 acts as DNA damage response enzyme that promotes survival of cancer cells with mutations within DNA repair genes. Therefore, PARP-1 inhibitors are used for treatment of cancers that harbor DNA repair genes mutations, such as BRCA-1 and BRCA-2. PARP-1 can also serves as a target for delivery of therapeutics radionuclides including alpha, beta, and auger emitting radionuclides. In neurodegeneration, PARP-1 can serve as a biomarker of neurodegeneration and as a therapeutic target for treating neuroinflammation.Dr. Mach and his team at Penn investigated the pharmacological impact of incorporating spirodiamine motifs into the phthalazine architecture of FDA approved PARPi olaparib. The team developed several first in class compounds that show high PARP-1 affinity and various catalytic inhibition, DNA damage properties, and cytotoxicity.

However, challenges remain due to safety risks such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and off-tumor toxicities. Targeting solid tumors is challenging due to immunosuppressive mechanisms and a hostile tumor microenvironment. Therefore, more advanced engineered T cells are necessary to improve targeting, localization, and autonomous regulation in hopes of overcoming the immunosuppression of the microenvironment to improve the efficacy and safety of cancer immunotherapy.Solution:Dr. Powell and colleagues have developed a novel, broadly-applicable all-in-one lentiviral system with highly optimized transcriptional elements that allow multiple functionalities to be produced simultaneously and specifically in response to contact with tumor antigen. This platform combines a constitutively expressed immune receptor (CAR/TCR) with an immunomodulatory effector molecule whose expression can be autonomously triggered by immune receptor signaling or the tumor microenvironment.This technology facilitates efficient and localized expression of effector molecules, potentially augmenting the treatment efficacy and limiting toxicities of adoptive cancer immunotherapy. Further, compared to current two-vector systems for transducing multiple transgenes, delivery of a single vector encoding constitutively and inducible expressed modules improves transduction efficiency, homogeneity of cell product and eliminates screening steps providing improved engineered T-cell manufacturing work-flows, shorter manufacturing timelines, and reduced manufacturing costs.Advantages:Autonomous, inducible and localized expression of effector molecules along with constitutive immune receptor expression in a single vector system may improve efficacy and/or limit toxicities of adoptive cancer immunotherapySingle vector gene delivery achieves a homogenous population of engineered immune cells without screening steps, improving T-cell manufacturing work-flows and reducing manufacturing costs.“Plug-and-play” single lentiviral system to generate a combination of different immune receptors and immune modulators, with varying levels of expressionThis platform enables high-throughput and quantitative screening and identification of antigen specific immune cells, such as CAR T cells, TCR modified cells or endogenous TILs.Applications:Provides a simplified platform for inducible expression of effector molecules in immune receptor-engineered T-cells for clinical applications.This single vector expression system provides an effective platform for researchers to construct and screen the combination of CAR/TCR and immune modulators of interest.Selected constructs can be used in adoptive cancer immunotherapy (e.g. CAR T) to improve the efficacy and/or minimize treatment-related complications (e.g., CRS, off-target toxicities) of engineered T-cells.This platform enables high-throughput and quantitative screening and identification of antigen specific immune cells, such as CAR T cells, TCR modified cells or endogenous TILs.Top Figure: Concept of engineered T cell with a single lentiviral vector with both constitutive immune receptor expression and autonomous antigen-induced immune modulator expression.

These maps are typically point clouds that provide obstacle positions without the providing any context.Penn professors Konstantinos Daniilidis and George Pappas have created a new algorithm that is more robust at recognizing new objects (such as a door or chair in an office setting) and classifying them correctly regardless of object orientation or sensor pose. This results in the first method to tightly couple inertial, geometric, and semantic observations into a single optimization framework.

In particular, sandwich structures consisting of two planar face sheets connected by a webbing or foam core, can provide an optimal design for applications that require low weight and high-stiffness. Despite their utility, currently available sandwich plates are prone to fracture or permanent deformation when mechanically loaded and have not been scaled to the nanometer scale.To overcome this issue, a new “nanocardboard” sandwich-like structure, has been invented. The nanocardboard is composed of two nanometer thick plates that are separated by a microscale gap and joined by rigid, periodic webbing.

The final, optimized basketweave webbing structure is ultrathin, ultralight, has a high bending stiffness, and resists fracture and deformation when mechanically loaded.

University of Pennsylvania,MRI Measurement of Abdominal Wall Muscle Compliance for Surgical Planning and Outcome Prediction,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38501,"A device and imaging method for non-invasive measurement of abdominal muscle elasticity and pre-operative prediction of successful hernia repairProblem:Two million abdominal surgeries are performed annually in the United States. Ventral hernia is one of the most common and serious post-operative complications with an incidence of approximately 13% amongst patients undergoing abdominal operations.Despite advances in medical imaging, pre and post-operative assessment of the abdomen and hernia repair currently relies on basic clinical evaluation of patients. However, clinical assessment poorly predicts the outcome of hernia repair surgeries. Failed repairs generate un-closable midline defects; these defects require additional surgery to reconstruct the abdominal wall using a synthetic mesh. The procedure is expensive and carries a risk of chronic infection and additional complications.Solution:To better identify patients at risk for developing a hernia pre or post abdominal surgery, we have created a predictive method centered on abdominal muscle mechanical properties.  This method uses magnetic resonance (MR) tissue-tagging in combination with an MR-compatible device that deforms the abdominal wall muscle synchronous with the imaging cycle.MR tissue-tagging is an imaging method that uses RF pulses to create a visible grid on organs undergoing cyclic motion to visualize the tissue deformation, which can then be used to compute the elastic properties of the abdominal muscle. This method has the potential to be used before the hernia repair surgery to determine the optimum hernia repair procedure and after surgery to predict repair outcome in patients.Advantages:Non-invasive assessment of muscle abdominal muscle complianceUsable with any conventional MRI scannerMore accurate prediction of failed hernia repair than conventional clinical methodsEarly prediction of failed hernia repair surgery  can prevent later complex surgeryApplications:Measuring abdominal muscle deformation and elasticityPredicting ventral hernia development in patientsStage of Development:Prototype developedIn-vivo experiments on healthy subjects have been performedInventors propose to conduct additional in-vivo testing in hernia repair patients for validationIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Dougherty L. et al., Measuring Abdominal Wall Muscle Deformation Using MR Tissue Tagging  Proceedings ofISMRM-ESMRMB, Paris, France, June 16-21, 2018Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:18-8518-tpNCSWeb Published:2/7/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38501"
University of Pennsylvania,Method to Produce CT-Like 3D Images of Bones and Hard Tissue From MRI Sequences,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38499,"Problem:Computed tomography (CT) is an imaging technique that enables 3D visualization of skeletal tissue. However, CT imaging exposes patients to hazardous radiation, which can be problematic for patients who require repeated scans or those in the pediatric population wherein the risks associated with radiation are greater.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is another imaging method that is widely used by clinicians. It exploits the magnetic properties of objects placed in a strong magnetic field to produce images by emitting radio frequency (RF) pulses to an object and detecting an RF “echo” from the object. Unlike CT, MRI does not expose patients to hazardous radiation, however, standard MRI sequences only visualize soft tissue. Current imaging sequences do not capture signal from bones because it is significantly shorter than the delay between the RF pulse and the detected echo. Recent ultra-short echo time methods have addressed this problem; however, they suffer from minimal contrast between soft and hard tissues. MRI scans are also inherently slower than CT scans as MRI data acquisition involves repeated measurement of the echoes obtained with minor changes in the total magnetic field in every repetition, which generates redundant data.Solution:This method combines long echo and short echo 3D imaging methods to distinguish signals from hard and soft tissues. Furthermore, it achieves this with considerably shorter scan times by incorporating “compressed sensing”, a mathematical technique that uses prior knowledge from data acquisition to eliminate redundant data.Advantages:An alternative to CT imaging without the harmful effects of radiationSimultaneous imaging of soft-tissue (brain, cartilage, etc.) and bone structureNear 10-fold shorter scan times than similar MRI protocolsImplementable on any MRI scannerApplications:Bone and hard tissue imagingPediatric imagingStage of Development:Methodology has been developedInventors propose to conduct additional clinical studies in humansIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Proceedings ofISMRM-ESMRMB, Paris, France, June 16-21, 2018Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:18-8473-tpNCSWeb Published:2/7/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38499"

However, the requirement of complex instructions for spatial, temporal, and reactive navigation makes controlling drone systems challenging. Most existing encoding systems are simplified and limited, and do not consider timing constraints, scalability, or real-world behaviors.Solution:Dr. Mangharam and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania have designed a new algorithm to control quadrotor drone behavior continuously using Signal Temporal Logic (STL). The method enables the consideration of explicit timing requirements and use of the full expressiveness of STL to optimize a smooth trajectory for drone movement. The system offers continuous-time STL satisfaction, feasible movement trajectories, and real-time drone control with scalability, providing a control framework for mission planning and execution for fleets of quadrotors.Advantages:Avoids oversimplifying abstractions while using off-the-shelf sensors and limited computationHandles complex spatial, temporal and reactive requirements for drone missionsScales well for problems involving up to 16 dronesMaximizes robustness in generating trajectories for quadrotors in continuous-timeMultiple autonomous drone missions in an urban environment.

This suggests that the p38 kinase (or MK2) can be possible targets for therapeutic intervention in Friedreich ataxia.rules, are highly specific to FA, and are active in the low nanomolar range. Several optimized modifications of the lead compounds have been generated.Technology Overview:Friedreich ataxia (FA) is an autosomal recessive, inherited neuro- and cardio-degenerative disorder characterized by progressive ataxia of all four limbs, skeletal deformities, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. FA is the most prevalent inherited ataxia, affecting about 1 in 50,000 people in the United States. The estimated carrier prevalence is 1:110.Onset of symptoms can vary from childhood to adulthood with most patients being confined to a wheelchair by their late 20s. Myocardial failure and/or arrhythmias are the most common cause of premature death. It is commonly believed that FA is caused by mitochondrial dysfunction caused by the decreased expression of the protein Frataxin.Advantages:A number of p38 kinase inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials for various indicationsRegulatory fast-track: FA is a FDA designated orphan disease with no approved treatmentAccess to the expertise and resources of Wilson’s lab (see Inventor’s Bio)Intellectual Property:USPendingReference Media:Cotticelli, MG et al.;Sci Rep 2018 March 22, 8(1): 5007Desired Partnerships:LicenseSponsored researchCollaborationCase ID:15-7449-tpNCSWeb Published:1/31/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38390"

It is caused by mutations in the DMD gene leading to an absence or severe reduction of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. There is currently no cure for DMD and all dystrophin-based approaches are associated with immunoreactivity limiting their long-term efficacy.Solution:Dr. Khurana and colleagues at University of Pennsylvania developed a method to upregulate utrophin, a dystrophin homolog protein, using CRISPR-Cas9 based genome editing and AAV-based delivery. The inventors have previously demonstrated in a mouse model that inhibiting the interaction between the let-7c miRNA and utrophin gene, which normally acts to represses expression, is able to increase utrophin expression and functionally rescue dystrophic phenotype. This discovery led to the present method that genomically edits the microRNA binding sites in the utrophin gene to ultimately upregulate utrophin expression.Unlike dystrophin-targeting gene therapy, this method is particularly attractive for therapeutic strategies, as extremely high levels of utrophin are not associated with toxicity or immunoreactivity.Advantages:No immunoreactivity associated with high levels of utrophin in vivoRescues dystrophic phenotypeApplication:Therapeutic for Duchenne Muscular DystrophyGene editing method to delete interaction between miRNA and utrophin gene leading to increased expression of utrophin.Stage of Development:In vitro dataAnimal studies plannedIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Mishra et al.PLoS One 2017 12(10): e0182676Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:18-8707-tpNCSWeb Published:2/13/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38536"
University of Pennsylvania,"Accurate, High-Throughput Quantification of HIV Reservoirs Using Optical Scanning",,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38314,"HIV viral protein expression and functional virus reservoir size are rapidly and accurately quantified using optical scanningProblem:HIV can incorporate itself into the DNA of a host cell without producing circulating virus. When lying dormant in these reservoirs, HIV cannot be detected and eradicated by the immune system of the host.As most of the HIV DNA in these reservoirs is hypermutated and incapable of producing infectious virions, a major hurdle in efforts to cure HIV, and to manage care of patients on antiretroviral therapy, is accurately quantifying the size of infection-competent viral reservoirs without interference from defective HIV DNA.Current methods to quantify viral load are labor-intensive and prone to systematic errors.Solution:This invention identifies replication-competent HIV reservoirs by screening for the presence of one protein (Gag) and downregulation of another (CD4) on the surface of cells. These features of cells infected with replication-competent HIV are encoded at disparate ends of the viral DNA; consequently, one of these features without the other is unlikely to occur in a cell that contains a replication competent provirus (the form of HIV integrated into the human chromosome).Fiber-optic assay scanning technology couples high-throughput optical scanning methods with an assay that recognizes target proteins via binding of dye-bearing antibodies to selectively identify cells infected with functional HIV. This method has the potential to quantify HIV reservoirs with faster results, improved accuracy, less labor, less technical expertise, and smaller required sample sizes.Advantages:Improved accuracy of HIV reservoir quantificationDistinguishes between replication competent and defective provirusesRapid, high-throughput quantificationFaster turn-around timeSmaller samples toleratedApplications:Monitoring HIV patients who are receiving antiretroviral therapy to determine baseline and induced reservoir expressionClinical research to determine the effects of new drugs such as latency reversal agents on HIVFiber-optic assay scanning technology (FAST) images show HIV Gag (red) and internalized CD4 (green) on the surface of cells.

However, the conventional method has several limitations such as significant user interaction, image manipulation, high processing time, and computer memory restrictions. The current method requires an intermediate step of converting DICOM files into StereoLithography  (STL) format file before conversion into the G-code instructions readable by 3D printers. This leads to a loss of structural information.Solution:Dr. Rajapakse at the University of Pennsylvania has developed computer code that converts DICOM to G-Code without going through STL conversation. This approach substantially reduces the time to obtain a 3D print, provides greater customizability - from changing print speeds to allowing for different extrusion amounts for either increased porosity or better adhesion to varying print paths.The code accounts for parameters such as printer’s resolution and speed of the extruder and allows for choosing the method of printing, from linear, to any inputted angle rotation between each layer.

First, the antibody has to have certain affinity to allow for sufficient binding time permitting the T cell to kill the target cells. Second, the scFv derived from the antibody must be conserve the affinity and specificity, followed by fusion with the rest of the CAR construct. Third, the antibody must bind to the appropriate location of the cell surface protein on the cancer cell to allow a certain distance between the T cell surface and the tumor cell surface to form effect immune synapse. There is a need for technologies allowing for efficient identification of potent, specific antibodies for CAR-T cell therapies.Dr. Xiaxin Hua and his team have developed Sequential Tumor-related Antibody and antigen Retrieving (STAR) technology that allows to efficiently identify nanobodies fully capable of binding to tumor cell surface antigens and guide the CAR-T cells in vivo to the specific tumors.

Most pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease, and their tumors are not surgically resectable, contributing to an overall 5-year survival rate of 7%. The lack of early diagnosis has made it challenging to develop therapeutics to slow or reverse PDAC.Currently CA19-9 is used to assess disease progression in PDAC patients. However its use is not recommended for general screening because (1) it is elevated in certain nonmalignant pancreatic conditions, such as chronic pancreatitis (2) it produce false negatives in individuals who do not express Lewis blood group antigens.Other secreted markers have been reported for PDAC including blood or urine proteins, exosomes, microRNAs, and epigenetic marks in circulating nucleosomes. However, most are discovered in advanced PDAC or cell lines that are not representative of earlier stages, when detection would be most relevant, although recent candidates have been tested or discovered in prediagnostic samples of PDAC. There is an urgent need for early detection of PDAC to be able to contemplate efficient therapeutic intervention.Solution:In an effort to develop early diagnostic prognostic, Dr. Kenneth Zaret at the Perelman School of Medicine has developed a 2-protein panel for early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Advantages:Assay done via ELISANo biopsy neededEarly detection of pancreatic cancerApplication:Early diagnostic of pancreatic cancerROC curves for THBS2, CA19-9, and THBS2 + CA19-9 concentrations in plasma samples from patients with all stages of PDAC versus healthy controls.   (D) PDAC, n = 197; controls, n = 140 studies.Stage of Development:Identified a two proteins-signature in plasma that detect early stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaFuture plans include prospective validation of this signatureIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Kim et al.,Sci.

Mutations in the RPGR gene are the leading cause of the X-linked form of RP (XLRP), where symptoms rapidly progress from impaired nighttime vision, to reduced visual field and loss of visual acuity, to patients ultimately becoming legally blind. However, there are currently no successful treatments available for patients suffering from XLRP.Dr. Beltran and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Florida have been developing an AAV-mediated gene therapy for the treatment of XLRP. Recombinant AAV carrying a stabilized form of the human RPGR gene under the control of a retinal photoreceptor promoter were synthesized. Delivery of the vector in preclinical RPGR XLRP canine models revealed that, depending upon the timing of administration, treatment could either prevent disease development or arrest its progression. Additionally, for those studies wherein degeneration had already begun, treatment was able to restore the remaining photoreceptors’ structure and function. This approach has demonstrated long-lasting therapeutic effects (>2 years) after one injection, making this a clinical candidate ready for additional development.Advantages:Prevents progression of retinitis pigmentosaImproves photoreceptor cell function for improved visual functionApplications:Use in gene therapy for treatment of heritable X-linked retinitis pigmentosa cause by a mutation in the RPGR geneStage of Development:In vivo preclinical testing – determining effective therapeutic range, establishing long-term efficacy of correctionIntellectual Property:US9,770,491US10,383,922EP2,872,183AU2013287281CA2,878,171JP6,199,965NZ704275Reference Media:Beltran et al.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2012 Feb 7; 109(6): 2132Beltran et al.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2015 Oct 27; 112(43): E5844Desired Partnerships:LicenseCase ID:Y6159-tpNCSWeb Published:6/7/2018Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/27847"
University of Pennsylvania,Therapeutic to Mitigate Epilepsy and Autism Development in Newborn Seizure Patients,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38500,"Neonatal brains are at high risk for seizures due to heightened electrical activity corresponding to neural development. Though anticonvulsant drugs exist to treat the seizures immediately, certain synaptic receptors (CP-AMPARs) become highly expressed, increasing the likelihood of developing epilepsy and autism-spectrum disorders. The inventors propose using CP-AMPAR blockers such as IEM-1460 to curb CP-AMPAR activity and prevent development of epilepsy and other neurological disorders.Problem:Neonatal brains are constantly in a state of electrical excitation due to the heightened neural activity required during development. They are therefore prone to hypoxic seizures, which can lead to long term synaptic development issues.AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are involved in the synaptic transmission of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system and one subset of these AMPARs are calcium-permeable (CP-AMPARs) because they lack the GluR2 subunit. In infants experiencing hypoxic seizures, these CP-AMPARs are upregulated and simultaneously, MeCP2, a transcription factor linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) becomes phosphorylated. MeCP2 is involved with synapse and dendrite development and neuronal maturation and thus, disruptions in its expression can lead to ASDs or epilepsy.AMPAR blockers have been considered as antiepileptogenetic drug candidates though they are not specific enough to target only CP-AMPARs.Solution:The inventors have therefore proposed using CP-AMPAR blockers such as IEM-1460 to inhibit CP-AMPAR activity and reduce MeCP2 phosphorylation. These CP-AMPAR blockers prevent the permeation of calcium into the neurons and as a result, the MeCP2 phosphorylation is inhibited.Advantages:Highly specific therapeutic that can be dose-adjusted for the patient’s ageEffectively reduces calcium influx into the neuron to inhibit MeCP2 phosphorylationApplications:An age-specific therapeutic to be used in patients who have suffered from neonatal seizuresCould be part of a drug cocktail along with other AMPAR blockers to effectively block epileptogenesisTop: Hippocampal GLUA2 expression decreases 48 h post hypoxia induced seizure.

University of Pennsylvania,"Low Cost, Mobile, Wearable EEG Device with High Quality Nanowire Sensors",,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54510,"Mobile, wearable, low cost electro-encephalogram (EEG) devices that offer research grade signals may provide a wealth of information regarding the brain states of individuals. This knowledge can be effectively utilized to develop personalized treatment protocols in medicine and individual customer–based advertisements for marketing.The inventors aim to establish sensitive, objective biomarkers that can vastly improve the quality of life of patients and customer satisfaction in business. This breakthrough device is being developed and commercialized through a University of Pennsylvania start-up, Cogwear LLC.Problem:In the last few years, the demand for advanced imaging techniques for brain monitoring has surpassed the available options. The global EEG devices market was valued at US $879 million in 2014 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 6.8% during the forecast period from 2015 to 2021 [Global Data].The EEG is one of the few methods of visualizing brain function and is the mainstay of diagnosis of seizure disorders as well as many other neurologic conditions. Conventional EEG devices used in research and in the clinic provide high-quality signals, that is, good signal-to-noise ratio. However, these devices are not conducive for mobile real world applications because they are wired devices that tether participants to a given location, limiting the activities that they can perform. Furthermore, these devices are not amenable for long-term use because the electrodes typically require electrolytic gel to make contact with the scalp, which dries out over time, thereby reducing signal quality and increasing discomfort due to dried salt deposits.There are currently no viable options for a research grade EEG device that can be worn for prolonged periods of time and are mobile enough to benefit from participants’ real world interactions.Solution:The present invention is an EEG device that is not only affordable, mobile, and wearable, but also provides research-grade signal quality.This EEG device uses silver nanowire-based dry electrodes that produce signal quality comparable to traditional wet electrodes. These sensors are biocompatible and are relatively straightforward to fabricate. Such a device would allow for continuous monitoring of an individual’s brain activity, allowing for the identification of specific biomarkers of individual behaviors in various settings.The applications are innumerable within the clinic and in consumer research, including continuous healthcare monitoring applications, personalized treatment protocols in medicine, individual customer-based advertisements for marketing, and optimal training programs in sports and music.Furthermore, given the research-grade signal produced by this device, it is feasible that silver nanowire based electrodes could entirely replace the existing wet electrodes in every current clinical application.Advantages:Mobile, Comfortable, No wet electrodes, Better and longer recordings.Applications:Medical:Identify functional biomarkers underlying medical conditions, including depression, anxiety, ADHD, PTSD (Wearable Diagnostic and Monitoring Devices1, Global Market 2015: $1.4B)Marketing/ Commercial Usage:Individualized consumer marketing (Neuromarketing Technology2, Global Market 2015: $21.0M)Training of athletes/musicians (Health and Fitness Wearables3, Global Market 2015, $1.7B)Video gaming (Wearable Gaming Hardware4, Global Market 2015, $1.24B)Anti-fatigue wearables (Health Self-Monitoring Peripherals5, Global Market 2014, $3.2B)Stage of Development:Prototype built and tested.Intellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Volk, S.;Wharton Magazine Spring/Summer 2018: 44.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentSponsored researchCase ID:18-8425-tpNCSWeb Published:6/26/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54510"
University of Pennsylvania,High Resolution Functional Imaging of Individual Cone Photoreceptors in the Living Human Eye,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/27751,"A non-invasive in vivo imaging technique using enhanced ophthalmoscopy to assess the intrinsic function of individual photoreceptor cells while maintaining high spatial resolution. This technique could be applied for both diagnostic purposes as well as the precise measurement of treatment response to both existing and experimental therapies for retinal diseases.Technology Overview:Functional assessments of vision, such as visual acuity, visual fields, microperimtery, and electroretingorams are critical for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of retinal diseases. These techniques are sensitive only for examining the function of a large area of retina and have insufficient resolution for detecting functional changes anywhere close to the scale of individual cones. This represents a significant gap in our ophthalmic assessment capabilities, especially given that current therapeutic approaches are attempting to restore function to individual photoreceptors.Noninvasive cellular-scale observation of the structure of human photoreceptor cells is made possible through the use of adaptive optics (AO) enhanced ophthalmoscopes, but establishing noninvasive objective measures of photoreceptor function on a similar scale has been more difficult.The inventors have developed a technique to assess the intrinsic function of individual photoreceptor cells using AO enhanced ophthalmoscope images acquired with near-infrared light.  The images have high spatial resolution (single cell level) with low signal-to-noise ratio and could be easily incorporated into, and improve upon, existing AO enhanced ophthalmoscopes using infrared illumination.Advantages:Functional, rather than structural, retinal imagingHigh spatial resolution (at the single cell level)Applications:Use in Ophthalmology clinics as an objective assessment of cone function.Monitoring retinal function as a primary or secondary outcome in clinical trials of new retinal gene therapies.Early and accurate diagnosis and surveillance of degenerative retinal diseases in the clinic.Top: The figure shows the cone intrinsic reflectance response measured from the stimulated and control trials. (A) Repeat control trials (cool colored lines) and stimulated trials (warm colored lines) show a clear, measurable, and reliable intrinsic reflectance response. (B) All trials for a given condition were then combined using pooled standard deviation, and the stimulus-evoked intrinsic reflectance response was taken as the difference between the stimulated and control pooled standard deviations. These results strongly indicate that the absorption of light by cone photopigment initiates a reflectance response, thereby making the intrinsic reflectance response a direct, non-invasive measure of photoreceptor function.Bottom: Preliminary results demonstrate that the Reflectance response can be used to measure non-functioning photoreceptors in those suffering retinopathies.Stage of Development:Human proof-of-concept studies completedFuture experiments will further optimize image acquisition and processing and determine the mechanistic origin of the functional responseIntellectual Property:US11,607,125Reference Media:Cooper, RF et al.;Biomed Opt Express 2018 Apr 1; 9(4): 1842Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:18-8578-tpNCSWeb Published:5/22/2018Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/27751"

It leads to reduced bone strength and increased risk of fracture. Hip fracture in particular is a devastating event with 50% of sufferers losing ability to walk and 20% of suffers dying from it.More than 2 million fractures and 300,000 hip fractures occur annually in the U.S. resulting in $20 billion and $12B in annual healthcare expenses, respectively. Currently, greater than 50% of the individuals with osteoporosis are not detected by bone density testing, the standard-of-care diagnostic test. More accurate and earlier diagnosis is needed and could lead to earlier treatment and the prevention of fractures, saving healthcare costs.Solution:Dr. Rajapakse and Dr. Chang have developed a software applied to high resolution MRI or CT images of bone microstructure for detailed evaluation of the mechanical strength of the bone. It allows for simulation of various loading conditions, takes into account shape, geometry and distribution of the trabecular building blocks during stress to describe mechanical integrity and accurately determines osteoporosis development and hip fracture risk.Advantages:Can be used with images from standard clinical MRI or CT machinesMore accurate prediction of osteoporosis development and hip fracture than DEXAEarlier detection and treatment of bone loss, leading to lower healthcare costsMore accurate monitoring of bone loss and treatment effectivenessEarly screening for predisposed patients (with osteoporosis, family history, metastatic cancer, diabetes, renal diseases)Applications:Diagnosis and prognosis of osteoporosis and bone pathologiesDriver for early treatment for patients with high riskMonitoring of disease progression and therapy responseStage of Development:Data from ~1000 patientsValidation data from cadaver bone exposed to mechanical stressIntellectual Property:US11,202,602Reference Media:Chang, G et al.;Radiology, 2014 August 272(2): 464Rajapkse, CS et al.;Radiology, 2017 Jun, 283 (3): 854Agten, CA et al.;Radiology, 2017 Nov, 285(2): 506Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:17-8291-tpNCSWeb Published:2/6/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38479"

This makes signal detection possible under low-magnification and separation of cells by RNA levels via flow cytometry.Technology Overview:Many amplification approaches rely on enzymes to achieve amplification. However, these for single nucleic acid amplification, existing approaches are non-specific and do not readily allow for measurements of large populations of cells for heterogeneity in gene expression. Alternative systems for single nucleic acid amplification require unique microscopy techniques.Researchers at Penn have demonstrated, through the use of click chemistry, that their clampFISH can achieve exponential amplification of target probes that detect single nucleic acids. Over 6 rounds of amplification they have achieved a 120-fold increase for RNA with very low background noise. This process makes the amplification technique viable for high throughput methods (flow cytometer) for measurement of single transcripts within a cell. The technology is currently being translated to multiplexed applications.Advantages:High Amplification of Single Nucleic Acid in TissueLow Background NoiseLends itself to high throughput and multiplexed applicationsRelieves the use of non-specific, bulky enzymes (less steps to achieve desired amplification)No need for high-powered cameraApplications:Amplification for high-throughput and possibly multiplexing systemsStage of Development:Prototype and Demonstration Model DevelopedMultiplexed DemonstratedIntellectual Property:PatentPendingDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-development (this replaces collaboration or sponsored research)Case ID:17-8198-tpNCSWeb Published:2/6/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38475"
University of Pennsylvania,Passive multidirectional illumination in light-sheet flourecense microscopy,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/31575,"Problem:Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy enables rapid scanning of biological samples to reconstruct a 3-dimensional image of the sample. However, images generally contain artifacts (shadows, stripes, etc.) that are caused by illumination inhomogeneity due to absorption or scattering within the sample. These artifacts can occlude observation of biological phenomena in a sample. Moreover, current products use expensive and technologically demanding instrumentation to address these issues.Solution:Researchers in Professor Douglas Durian’s laboratory in the University of Pennsylvania’s Department of Physics and Astronomy have developed methods to passively generate multidirectional illumination in a light-sheet imaging system using a light shaping diffuser. The outcomes include the elimination of optical artifacts, similar to those described above.

University of Pennsylvania,High performance cageless bearings with minimal frictional loss,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38480,"The invention is a cageless bearing with rolling separator elements. The design will reduce friction by ensuring the rolling elements are only ever in pure rolling, as opposed to sliding contact which involves higher frictional losses. Additionally, these elements are not in sliding contact with the inner race. Categories for applications include portable medical devices, toys and consumer robotic applications with medium force requirements.Technology Overview:The global bearings market size was valued at USD 81.6 billion in 2015 and is expected to grow, significantly, owing to the increasing commercial and industrial machinery and manufacturing activity. Bearings are used in virtually every machine that contains a rotating shaft to rotate freely with minimal friction.The design of conventional cageless bearing systems is inefficient due to both sliding and incidental friction losses as well as viscous losses due to requirement of lubrication. Hence the main problem is mechanical inefficiency.  Additionally, some of the systems also incorporate complex components into their design, such as gear teeth or harmonic gear cups that increase cost. For heavy-duty vehicles, 26% of the fuel energy is spent overcoming parasitic frictional losses such as bearing loss. If bearing loss can be significantly reduced, the fuel efficiency of such systems could be significantly improved.Researchers at Penn have described a normal cageless bearing with added rolling separator elements to overcome these issues. The proposed bearing system eliminates sliding friction losses by ensuring that all contacting surfaces have the same velocity which leads to pure rolling, thereby reducing incidental contact. This design can be modified into a friction drive transmission device with a small form factor by splitting the outer race into two parts. The result is a low cost, low noise and high efficiency system with no sliding, incidental, and viscous losses.Advantages:High efficiency and high-performance systemNo sliding, viscous and incidental friction lossesLow noiseLow cost due to reduced manufacturing and assembly costs (no cage or gear teeth)Eliminates need for lubricationTransmission has a small form factorApplications:High performance with low frictional loss bearingThis no-slip bearing system can be modified to become combined friction drive transmission and bearing.The bearing can be used in combination with Prendo’s robot arm product (PI’s UPstart company)Example categories for applications include portable medical devices, toys and consumer robotic applications with medium force requirementsStage of Development:Prototype developedIntellectual PropertyPatentPendingDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:17-8302-tpNCSWeb Published:2/6/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38480"
University of Pennsylvania,Therapeutic Targets for T-Cell Lymphomas and Other Types of Cancer,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39348,"Interdependence of oncogenic and epigenetic mechanisms in T-cell lymphoma.Technology Overview:Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a highly malignant type of Non-Hodgkin’s T cell lymphoma in which chromosomal translocation leads to the expression of a fusion oncoprotein Tyrosine Kinase - Nucleophosmin/Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase or NPM/ALK.Dr. Wasik showed that NPM/ALK positive cancer cells have a selective loss of STAT5A, a tumor suppressor protein and a reciprocal inhibitor of NPM/ALK. (U4592)NPM/ALK, acting through STAT3 transcription factor, selectively inhibits expression of STAT5a gene. Induction of STAT5a expression, either by gene transduction or application of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor to reverse the gene silencing, results in the inhibition of NPM/ALK expression and, consequently, death of the malignant cells.The invention also provides a method to diagnose malignancy and monitor patient’s response to therapy by analysis of the degree of DNA methylation of the gene encoding for Stat5a or its analog, their mRNA, or protein.Dr. Wasik also demonstrated that NPM/ALK induces the expression of immunosuppressive protein CD274, also known as PD-L1 or B7-H1 through STAT3. (V4957)This invention provides methods for inhibiting an oncogenic protein or its down-stream effector to suppress expression of a cell-surface protein (PDL-1) involved in inhibiting immune response against malignant cells thereby enhancing the immunogenicity of a cell. The invention includes inhibitors of function or expression of oncogenic ALK tyrosine kinase and/or other oncogenic proteins and their effectors such as STAT3 responsible for induction of expression of CD274 or its functional immunosuppressive equivalent. This approach may represent an attractive (and not mutually exclusive) alternative to inhibiting CD274 and similar immunosuppressive with antibodies.In addition, Dr. Wasik developed transformed CD4+ T cells by expressing NPM-ALK in normal human CD4+ T lymphocytes.The NPM-ALK CD4 transformed cells become immortalized and display morphology and immunophenotype of patient derived anaplastic large-cell lymphomas. This is the first method to succeed in immortalizing these cells and the first to transform normal human cells of any kind using a well-defined single oncogene relevant to human disease.Combined, these results demonstrate the relevance of targeting NPM-ALK or its downstream effectors as a potential immuno-onco-therapeutic approach. Given their uniqueness, these NPMALK transformed normal human CD4+ T cells may also be used to study therapeutic strategies aimed at prevention of cancer development.Applications:Immuno-onco-therapeutic targets in lymphoma and other types of cancerResearch tool to study cell transformation including its very early stages and to screen for compounds that could be effective in treating anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCL)Research tool to generate immortalized, although abnormal, T lymphocytes from both, healthy individuals and patients with autoimmune and other diseases.Stage of Development:Proof of concept in vitroIntellectual Property:US9,486,469US10,166,251US9,255,279Reference Media:Zhang, Q et al.;Nat Med 2007 Nov 13(11): 1341.Marzec, M et al.;Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2008 Dec, 105(52): 20852.Zhang, Q et al.;Am J Path 2013 Dec 183(6): 1971Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:Z6498-tpNCSWeb Published:3/20/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39348"

First-line treatment involves plasmapheresis to lower autoantibody levels and replenish ADAMTS13 through transfusion of donor plasma. However, treatment is nonspecific, expensive, and not always effective. Additionally, the development of therapies has been limited by the lack of animal models specific to the human autoantibodies.Dr. Donald Siegel and colleagues have cloned and sequenced human monoclonal ADAMTS13 autoantibodies from patients with acquired TTP. They have identified the specific sequences that block ADAMTS13 function to cause TTP pathogenesis. Using these recombinant human ADAMTS13 autoantibody sequences, a novel TTP murine model has been generated that recapitulates key pathologic features, and new therapeutics, such as anti-idiotypic antibodies, are currently being developed for the targeted TTP treatment, which improves specificity over current treatment methods.Advantages:Provides an alternative improved, targeted and cheaper treatment for acquired TTPImproves animal models of TTP for more accurate testing of human therapeutic agentsApplications:Development of more effective, targeted therapies for TTP, such as anti-idiotypic agentsGeneration of improved animal models of TTP that permits testing of therapeutics targeting human antibody/ADAMTS13 interactionStage of Development:Human anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies have been sequenced and binding sites identifiedPathogenicity of ADAMTS13 autoantibodies established in an animal modelCurrently developing humanized antibodies from anti-idiotypic antibodiesIn vivo testing, humanized TRMIntellectual Property:US11,597,778Reference Media:Ostertag et al.Transfusion, 2016, 56(7) - 1763.Ostertag et al.Transfusion, 2016, 56(7) - 1775.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:15-7389-tpNCSWeb Published:1/28/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38313"
University of Pennsylvania,A language assessment to determine healthy (salutogenic) empathy,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38477,"Researchers at Penn have developed a natural-language and social media- language based evaluation tool set for natural language (including social media posts) that provides a salutogenic empathy scoreProblem:Empathy refers to a variety of states and traits involving a reaction to another’s suffering. Empathy is a highly sought after trait in certain domains. Yet empathy is poorly understood which has led to inconsistent ways of measuring it. Research suggests that there are different types of empathy, which have varying impacts on our well-being and helping behavior. Salutogenic empathy; i.e. “putting oneself into the person’s shoes” -while avoiding an emotional reaction - has been shown to be adaptive, health-promoting, and more conducive to effective helping behavior. Measuring this empathy in individuals would be valuable.Solution:Adults use social media regularly. Sites such as Facebook and Twitter consist of large informal networks of users who provide updates on: their thoughts, opinions, feelings, activities, and interactions with other people. We use these databases of autobiographical and longitudinal data to gain insights into the personality, thoughts and feelings, action tendencies, and physical and psychological health outcomes of users. Social media-based models have the advantage of basing predictions and insights on years of autobiographical data, while still remaining based in the ground truth of a self-reported assessment.The World Well Being Project has created a lexicon that analyzes social media posts to provide a near real-time analysis of the salutogenic empathy of a social media user. The use of an unobtrusive tool allows for passive monitoring of large population sizes that does not face the bias associated with traditional psychological questionnaires.Advantages:Near real-time analysisUses existing social media information streamsDoes not require direct interaction with analysis groupCan be narrowly defined to analyze a groupCould be utilized to monitor salutogenic empathy over time.Applications:Evaluating the salutogenic empathy of the general or a defined population (a team, workforce, event participants, etc…)Stage of Development:The salutogenic empathy lexicon has been developed and is ready for use.Intellectual Property:Copyright, Trade SecretReference Media:Body of publications available through theWorld Well Being ProjectDesired Partnerships:LicensingCo-developmentResearch useCase ID:17-8269-tpNCSWeb Published:2/6/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38477"

Using a novel structure based design approach to identify small molecule compounds that bind to an allosteric site on TNF-R1, thus inhibiting binding of TNF-alpha to TNF-R1 and reducing activation of the TNF-alpha/TNF-R1 signaling pathway, the inventors have uncovered a new class of compounds that are effective at inhibiting the pathologic side-effects of TNF signaling while preserving the patient's ability to mount an immune response against pathogens.  Lead candidates are potent, highly specific and have been demonstrated to ameliorate arthritis in vivo.Intellectual Property:US8,765,810US9,096,607US8,318,699EPO1845970EPO2305246EPO2298295Canada2596355Australia2006210778Reference Media:Murali, R. et al.PNAS. 2005 Aug 2; 102(31): 10970Case ID:R3651-tpNCDWeb Published:6/21/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54475"

However, catechol moieties can produce cytotoxic concentrations of reactive oxygen species which limit their biocompatibility. Existing alternatives to catechol-based systems require harsh conditions, heat, light exposure, or non-physiological pH to function.Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Department of Chemical Engineering have developed an adhesive hydrogels material that adheres to substrates underwater by applying slight pressure for less than one minute.

It is characterized by progressive degeneration of skeletal and cardiac muscle due to a defective form of the gene dystrophin.  There is currently no cure for DMD and the available treatment options have limited ability to address the underlying cause of DMD: dystrophin absence or dysfunction.Dr. Khurana at the University of Pennsylvania has been interested in targeting utrophin, the homolog of dystrophin, as an approach for treating DMD.  Previous work has demonstrated that increasing utrophin expression can compensate for the lack of functional dystrophin in DMD, resulting in improved muscular integrity and strength.In collaboration with Dr. Wilton at Murdoch University, the researchers have developed a strategy for increasing utrophin expression, which has been validated in a mouse model of DMD.  The approach targets let7c, a microRNA that normally suppresses expression of utrophin.  Through the use of site blocking oligonucleotides, the interaction of let7c with utrophin is disrupted, resulting in the elevation of utrophin expression and rescue of the DMD phenotype. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic approach for DMD.Advantages:Efficacy demonstrated in mouse modelNo observed toxicityApplications:Treatment of DMDStage of Development:Studies completed in mouse model of DMD (mdx mouse)Intellectual Property:US11,028,389Case ID:15-7411-tpNCSWeb Published:1/28/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38315"

Previous studies have found that 45% of dogs aged 10 years or older and 23% of dogs of any age die from cancer. The gold standard of veterinary cancer therapy is systemic administration of chemotherapeutic agents that inhibit cell division and induce cell death. These agents are not tumor-specific and frequently cause adverse side effects which limit the dose that can be given and potentially the therapeutic efficacy.Solution:Dr. Nicola Mason has devised a patented method to generate and isolate canine scFvs for in vivo use as immune targeted therapeutics.

University of Pennsylvania,2D metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) electrodes,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54487,"Problem:Current implantable devices for recording and stimulating electrical activity in the body are fabricated with metal based components. The metal components pose issues for long term implantation and functionality, including scarring, inflammation, degradation and fatigue. Furthermore, the physical properties of metals are typically inadequate to achieve good quality recording and stimulation performance.Solution:MXene’s offer a unique combination of electrical conductivity, strength, flexibility and volumetric capacitance (300-400 F/cm3). Furthermore, by varying processing parameters, the MXenes are >90% transparent. The electrochemical impedance of MXene neural sensors measured at 1 kHz is 4 times smaller than that of gold electrodes of the same size. When used for recording of neural signal in vivo, this reduction in impedance significantly suppresses noise from electrical interference (> 400-fold reduction compared to gold electrodes) and from electronic noise in the electrode itself (50% less than gold).The MXene ECoG electrodes were tested in vivo in an anesthetized rat, where they were placed on the exposed cortex, showing significantly reduced baseline noise compared to gold electrodes of the same size. Excitingly, penetrating MXene depth electrodes recorded unit activity (individual neuron spiking activity), which was not detected on the gold contacts.

University of Pennsylvania,Heart disease diagnostic and prognostic,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39352,"Indicators for treatment of bicuspid aortic valve and aortopathies.Problem:Bicupsid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart defect in the US, with an approximate incidence of 1 in 50 births. BAV frequently leads to valve dysfunction and is associated with serious adverse aortic events such as aortic aneurysm, dissection and rupture. The primary surgical intervention for BAV is aortic valve replacement.The clinical parameters (aortic diameter, expansion rate, ratio of aortic area to body weight) currently used to determine whether surgical intervention is needed for patients with BAV are imperfect as many BAV patients do not meet these criteria, but may go on to develop a serious aortic event before surgical intervention is indicated. There is a need for the development of alternative diagnostic methods and indicators for surgical intervention for BAV patients in order to reduce the risk of patients developing life-threatening cardiac events.Solution:Research conducted by Drs. Giovanni Ferrari and Emanuela Branchetti demonstrates that plasma levels of the soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) may be a novel biomarker for BAV and related aortopathies. Elevated sRAGE was found to be highly associated with both BAV and aortopathies. Importantly, sRAGE elevation was independent of aortic diameter and the ratio of aortic area to body weight, which are two clinical parameters currently used to assess whether a patient should undergo surgery. This work suggests that circulating plasma sRAGE levels could be used in the diagnosis of BAV and aortopathies and to identify patients needing surgical intervention.Advantages:Novel diagnostic parameter for BAV and aortopathiesSimple blood test measurementApplications:Diagnosis of BAV and associated aortopathiesIndicator for surgical intervention for BAV and associated aortopathiesStage of Development:Validation complete in surgical cohort of 135 patientsIntellectual Property:US11,668,721PCTActiveReference Media:Branchetti, E et al.;Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, 2014 Oct; 34(10): 2349.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:Z6510-tpNCSWeb Published:3/20/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39352"
University of Pennsylvania,Novel class of therapeutics for treatment of lupus and other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54465,"First in class compounds inhibiting BRISC deubiquitinating enzymes for treatment of autoimmune diseases.Problem:Lupus is an autoimmune disease affecting approximately 5 million people worldwide. Lupus results in a hyperactive immune system and multisystem pathologic changes to joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, and lungs. Immunosuppressive drugs are the current standard of care for lupus patients, but have unfavorable side effects and limitations leaving a need for alternative treatment methods.Solution:A majority of individuals with lupus display elevated expression of type-1 interferon (IFN) inducible genes in circulating immune cells and peripheral tissues, which correlates with disease severity. Dr. Roger Greenberg has discovered that BRISC deubiquitinating enzymes play a critical role in IFN and other inflammatory cytokine responses and showed that BRISC deficiency in mice reduces activation of immune cells and ameliorates lupus.Dr. Greenberg’s team includes a medicinal chemist, structural biologist, and molecular biologist. They have reported the structural basis of BRISC activation and developed the first high throughput screen for small molecule BRISC inhibitors. They have obtained several potent and specific lead BRISC inhibitors and are optimizing them using medicinal chemistry and rational drug design approaches. This novel class of therapeutics present potential utility in treatment of lupus as well as other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions driven by elevated cytokine responses.Advantages:First in class therapeuticsNumerous drug analogs undergoing further optimizationBRISC knockout and enzymatically inactive knock-in mouse modelsStructural biology of BRISC in active and inactive statesNovel high throughput screening technology for BRISC inhibitorsApplications:Treatment of lupus and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseasesStage of Development:Lead BRISC inhibitors with IC50~1.5μMSeveral series of compound analogsIntellectual Property:PCT PendingReference Media:Zheng et al.Cell Rep, 5(1): 180-93, 2013Zeqiraj et al.Mol cell,59(6): 970-83, 2015.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:16-7774-tpNCSWeb Published:6/21/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54465"
University of Pennsylvania,Improved stress and nutrient response in plants via root hair regulation,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38473,"This technology is aimed at improving crop production in the era of global climate change and rising fertilizer costs.Problem:Feeding 7 Billion people is a global concern, and this problem continues to grow year-to-year. A large problem for the agricultural industry is finding a way to grow food on less arable land, while also decreasing expensive inputs (water, nutrients, chemicals, etc…), while still maintaining competitive yields. By identifying plants that can grow in stressed environments as effectively as normal conditions, we can begin to address this problem. A key driver for this will be plants that can more effectively take in water and nutrients, which will allow them to grow successfully in more challenging environments.Solution:Research within Professor Gregory’s laboratory in the Biology Department at the University of Pennsylvania has led to the discovery of gene regulation opportunities for improving crop plant traits in response to water, heat, and nutrient-stressed situations. The over expression of a particular gene causes an increase in surface area of the root by increasing the number of root hairs. Plants regulate the ratio of root hair to non-hair cells depending on environmental signals.Studies have shown that increasing the root hair population increases the uptake of nutrients (e.g. phosphate) and water which enhances the plants ability to survive in stress environments; such as heat, drought, or nutrient deficient situations.Plants grown under nutrient-poor conditions develop a higher density and longer hair cells. Roots can only absorb inorganic phosphates, present at very low concentrations in soil. This is why phosphate starvation is one of the most common nutrient stresses in plants, and is characterized by increased root hair length, increased root hair density, increased lateral root production branching away from primary roots, and upregulated secretion of acid phosphatases to produce inorganic phosphate from organic phosphate that can be subsequently absorbed by the plant. Testing has shown that overexpression of the targeted gene improves plant tolerance to phosphate starvation through a cascade of processes that results in increased phosphate uptake through changes in the root system.Advantages:Could be designed to promote optimal nutrient uptake in less arable situations or under stress of heat, nutrient deprivation, and/or droughtCould increase growth and development in plants based on increase in efficiency of absorption of nutrientsApplications:Develop crops that are readily able to survive in stressed situations or with the use of fewer nutrient inputsIntellectual Property:US10,526,614Reference MediaFoley, S et al.;Dev Cell 2017 Apr 24  41(2): 204.Penn TodayDesired Partnerships:LicensingCo-developmentCase ID:17-8052-tpNCS-2Web Published:2/6/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38473"
University of Pennsylvania,Topical Treatment for Autoimmune Disorders,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54112,"Treatment method for autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis using skin application of a vitamin D analog where topical treatment leads to systemic immunoregulation.Problem:Immunomodulatory drugs are typically administered systemically and often lead to severe side effects. Moreover, intravenous injections of such drugs are burdensome for patients and drive additional cost and risks. Whenever treatment involves biological compounds it further increases the cost and requires special storage, shipping, and handling.Solution:Many inflammatory diseases are mediated by inappropriately activated T cells. Regulatory T cells (Tregs), on the other hand, limit such inappropriate T cell activation, and prevent inflammatory diseases. Dr. Kambayashi has discovered that topical administration of a vitamin D3 analog MC903 leads to the release of keratinocyte-derived thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) by skin cells into circulation, which then systemically increases the number of Tregs. He further has shown that this Treg expansion leads to attenuation of inflammatory diseases such as type I and type II diabetes, multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis in mouse models. Thus use of transdermal patch delivering MC903 provides a promising approach for treatment autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.Advantages:Topical treatment producing systemic effectMC903 has limited systemic absorption and half-life preventing systemic toxicitiesMC903 is used for psoriasis treatment (expired patent, available generics)Application:Patch or other method of transdermal deliveryStage of Development:Mouse models of type I diabetes (NOD mouse)Multiple sclerosis (EAE mouse model)Atherosclerosis (ApoE KO mouse model)Rheumatoid arthritis (serum-induced arthritis)Intellectual Property:US10,391,107US10,980,820US11,752,159Reference Media:Leichner, TM et al;J Autoimmun, 2017 May, 79: 39.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:15-7433-tpNCSWeb Published:5/3/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54112"
University of Pennsylvania,Image processing algorithm that enables accurate feature tracking on rapidly moving objects,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38471,"Engineers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed an algorithm that works in conjunction with high speed cameras to enable feature tracking on extremely fast moving objects. This innovative algorithm could enable rapid object tracking, inform robotic positioning, and improve image stabilization.Problem:The speed with which standard cameras can capture motion is inherently limited by their collection frame rates. As a result, novel “event-based” cameras that can take images with a very high time resolution (1 micro-second) have recently been developed. These cameras have the ability to capture the movement of very fast-moving objects.However, current methods to process the videos taken by the “event-based” cameras are unable to accurately track features or objects captured in the videos. Thus, there is a need for an algorithm that can track the movement of fast-moving features and objects recorded in the videos of “event-based” cameras.Solution:To address this gap in technology, members of the Daniilidis Lab developed an image processing algorithm that is capable of tracking features on extremely fast moving objects imaged by the “event-based” cameras. Their algorithm relies upon probabilistic data associations to accurately track features over time. In addition to enabling rapid object tracking with relevant uses in automation and military defense, this technology could be used to inform robotic positioning and improve image stabilization.Advantages:Enables feature tracking on extremely fast-moving objectsCan be used in conjunction with high speed “event-based” camerasMore accurate than standard feature-tracking methods used with frame-based camerasApplications:Fast object tracking (with uses in automation and military defense)Image stabilizationRobotic positioning3D image reconstructionStage of Development:The algorithm has been developed and validated.Intellectual Property:US11,138,742Reference Media:2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA):Event-based Feature Tracking with Probabilistic Data AssociationThe code for this research can be foundhereDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:17-8049-tpNCSWeb Published:2/6/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38471"

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can travel in swarms across a wide area, quickly surveying an entire field or orchard. These vehicles are equipped with a custom suite of sensors that can perform functions such as fruit counting, disease detection, thermal stress mapping, and other intelligence gathering functions.

Most SOFCs have anodes made from cermets (ceramic-metal composites), usually mixtures of nickel and ceramics such as yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). However, these anodes perform poorly with fuels that contain sulfur, such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Other metallic anodes have poor thermal stability or do not tolerate oxidation well. Anodes with improved performance would make it easier to use SOFCs with commonly-available commercial fuels.Solution:Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed high-performance SOFC ceramic anodes with improved electrocatalytic activity and redox stability for use with hydrocarbon fuels. These anodes provide high fuel efficiency and high cell power density at operating temperatures less than 800C. This design features a thin functional layer and a thick conduction layer, allowing materials in each layer to be optimized independently.

University of Pennsylvania,Non-invasive detection of EGFRvIII mutations in Glioblastoma using MRI,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/24160,"Technology Overview:GBM has a highly variable molecular, spatial and temporal fingerprint making analysis difficult. Current methods require tissue biopsies which fail to capture the heterogeneity of GBM, and damage healthy tissue.Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a cell growth regulator, is mutated and/or overexpressed in most intractable GBM cases. The EGFRvIII mutation is expressed only in cancer tissue. Detecting EGFRvIII is valuable for diagnosing and determining treatment options; however, invasive procedures are required and consistent follow-ups are nearly impossible. An accurate, reproducible, non-invasive method for diagnosis of GBM with EGFRvIII mutation is needed.The inventors have developed a non-invasive imaging marker of EGFRvIII by using dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI (DSC-MRI) and advanced statistical procedures, where the spatial and temporal location of EGFRvIII can be accurately determined by patients’ MRI phenotype. This resolves the need of repeated biopsies and provides useful preoperative information on the mutation status as well as the means for potential continuous non-invasive monitoring of the mutation during and after therapy.Advantages:Useful in pre-operative evaluation, enabling decisions on aggressiveness of treatmentRobust, non-invasive and easy to preform testEnable post-operative monitoring of EGFRvIII expressing regions over timeApplication:A diagnostic tool for treatment and monitoring of GBMBlack hatch marks (right) indicate representative highest EGFRvIII expression.Stage of Development:Tested in a cohort of 142 patientsIntellectual Property:US11,107,217Reference Media:Bakas, S. et al.;Clin Cancer Res 2017 Aug,23(16): 4724.Bilello, M et al.;NeuroImage Clin 2016 Mar,  12: 34.Macyszyn, L et al.;Neuro-oncology 2016 March 18(3): 417Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:14-7156-tpNCSWeb Published:2/22/2017Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/24160"

Only 50-80% of patients reach complete remission (CR) as a result of standard chemotherapy while the rest suffer from side effects without significant benefit to their health.Variable response to chemotherapy in AML represents a major treatment challenge. While clinical and genetic features incompletely predict outcome, there is a clear correlations between patient outcome in AML and DNA methylation patterns. However, tests directly measuring multiple-locus DNA methylation are expensive and technically challenging.There is a need for a better, cheaper, and readily available diagnostic test to inform clinicians about appropriate treatment and better identify AML patients who are likely to achieve remission.Solution:Dr. Carroll and Dr. Wertheim have developed a strategy, multi-locus microsphere HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated PCR (xMELP), to simultaneously analyze the DNA methylation pattern at up to 50 loci.This technique is inexpensive and easily performed in a clinical molecular pathology laboratory. Inventors used xMELP to analyze methylation pattern at 18 loci in AML patients and determined methylation statistic (M-score) for 166 patients with de novo AML and in independent cohort of 383 patients from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG).M Score segregates AML patients into prognostic subgroups with significantly distinct mortality risk (P = 0.009). In the ECOG study, M-score was associated with death (P = 0.011) and failure to achieve CR (P = 0.034). Median survival was 26.6 months versus 10.6 months for low and high M-score groups. Thus, the xMELP assay and associated M-score can be used for prognosis and for clinical decision making in AML patients.Advantages:QuantifiableInexpensive and simple (2 reaction tubes needed)Fast (2 days)Utilizes standard clinical lab equipmentApplications:Simultaneous analysis of DNA methylation at up to 50 lociAML mortality prognosis to inform clinicians on appropriate treatmentsMethod can be applied for development of prognostic test for cancers with demonstrated correlation between DNA methylation and clinical prognosis  (T-cell and B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, NSCLC, ovarian carcinoma, melanoma etc)Stage of Development:Developed xMELP assay and random forest classifier with a training set of an AML patient cohortValidated in three cohorts of patients from UPENN, ECOG and MD Anderson.Intellectual PropertyUS Patent11,473,131Reference Media:Wertheim et al.Clin Chem. 2015 Jan; 61(1): 249DiNardo et al.Am J Hematol 2016; EpubLuskin et al.JCI Insight 2016, 1(9): e87323Wertheim et al.J Mol Diagn 2014 March 16(2): 207Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:15-7238-tpNCSWeb Published:1/27/2017Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/23884"

University of Pennsylvania,GRP8 as a target for improving plant stress response to water and nutrient starvation,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38472,"Genetically engineered plants for increased resistance to nutrient stressProblem:The plant root epidermis absorbs water and nutrients from the environment, using long hair-like projections from root hair cells to increase surface area. Plants regulate the ratio of root hair to nonhair cells based on environmental signals, with plants grown under nutrient-poor conditions developing higher density and longer hair cells. Roots can only absorb inorganic phosphates, present at very low concentrations in soil, making phosphate starvation one of the most common nutrient stresses in plants. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms regulating root hair cell fate and phosphate starvation response are not well understood.Solution:The Gregory Lab has discovered that the overexpression of the GRP8 gene (glycine-rich RNA-binding protein) increases the number of root hairs on the surface of plant roots, increasing the surface area for water and nutrient absorption. This finding is the first identification of GRP8 as a promising target for crop plant trait improvement, with connections to stress response to water and nutrient deprivation.GRP8 overexpression was also determined to improve plant tolerance to phosphate starvation, with acid phosphatase levels in Arabidopsis roots correlating with GRP8 abundance.  By measuring the expression of phosphate starvation response genes under normal growth conditions, GRP8 was found to positively regulate the transcripts of phosphate transporters and their upstream activators.Advantages:GRP8 gene is highly conserved among ground plantsEnhanced resistance to environmental stress conditions, including drought and nutrient deprivationApplications:Crop plant trait improvementImprove energy efficiency by reducing need for fertilizer applicationImages of root hairs with normal in (A), upregulated production in (B), and downregulated production in (C).Stage of Development:Proof-of-concept testingIntellectual Property:US10,526,614Reference MediaFoley, S et al.;Dev Cell 2017 Apr 24  41(2): 204.Bailie, KPenn Today2017 April 24Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:17-8052-tpNCS-1Web Published:2/6/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38472"

There is a critical clinical need for biomarker platforms that would allow for early diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of these conditions.Solution:Exosomes are extracellular microvesicles released by many tissue types into bodily fluids. They carry tissue specific RNA and protein cargoes reflecting the conditional status of the originating tissue. Islet β cells are also known to release exosomes that are specific to the tissue.Dr. Vallabhajosyula at Penn discovered that transmembrane protein ion channel regulator FXYD2 is expressed on the surface of the islet β cell exosomes and can be used for isolation and purification of islet β cell-specific exosomes.Islet exosomes demonstrated expression profile differences in type I diabetes patients compared to normal controls, including reduced insulin levels. The Inventor analyzed differences in microRNA, long RNA, as well as proteomic and metabolite profiles. Together, the ability to isolate islet β cell specific exosomes from patients’ blood can potentially be used as a novel biomarker platform to monitor patients with type I and type II diabetes and other metabolic diseases.Advantages:Diagnostic platform for early prognosis and diagnosis of metabolic diseasesApplications:Method of isolation and purification of islet β cells specific exosomes from serum/plasmaStage of Development:Small size human sample dataIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Under ReviewDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:15-7302-tpNCSWeb Published:6/21/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54464"

However, clinical response to immunotherapies is variable and dependent on cancer types as well as specific characteristics or genetic mutations within a patient’s individual tumor. There is a need for tumor-specific therapies with applicability to a range of cancer types.Solution:The Facciabene lab at the University of Pennsylvania has developed a technology that uses Tumor Associated Mitochondria Antigens (TAMAs) extracted from the tumor as a cancer vaccine. The technology involves pulsing dendritic cells with TAMAs.In an in vivo model of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) the vaccine elicits a cytotoxic T-cell response and provides long-term protection from tumor progression when used either prophylactically or therapeutically.The Facciabene lab has established that TAMAs can produce an effective anti-tumor immune response in RCC. Future work will validate the data in human RCC and investigate additional cancer types and combinations with other immunotherapies.Advantages:Long-term protection from tumor progression demonstrated in RCCPotential use in other cancer types with mutations in mitochondrial proteins (e.g. kidney, colorectal, ovarian, breast, bladder, lung, pancreatic)Utilization of a dendritic cell platform validated in humansApplications:Cancer immunotherapyPotential in metabolic or mitochondrial diseasesStage of Development:In vitro and in vivo animal dataHuman RCC sample evaluation of mitochondrial mutations and correlation with survival and immune cell infiltrationIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Kreeger, K.Penn Medicine News - 2015 Oct 26Pierini S et al.;J Immunol 2015 Oct 15, 195(8): 4020Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:14-7082-tpNCSWeb Published:1/23/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38082"
University of Pennsylvania,New Therapy for Skin Infections in Companion Animals,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38466,"A selective method for treating bacterial skin and ear infections in dogs, cats, and horses.Problem:Pyoderma, or bacterial infection of the skin, is the most common dermatologic problem encountered in cats and dogs. The two main organisms causing pyoderma in companion animals are Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Staphylococcus schleiferi. Currently, the same antibiotics are used for treating both human and animal staphylococcal infections.Recently these species have been developing resistance to antibiotics such as methicillin, sulfonamides and tetracycline, leaving limited treatment options, particularly for animals with repetitive skin infections. The global anti-infective market for companion animals was valued at $977 million of the total $7.5 billion animal pharmaceutical market in 2014 and is expected to reach over a billion dollars by 2019.Solution:Research led by Dr. Dan Beiting has demonstrated that unlike the Staphylococcus species that commonly affect humans, the veterinary forms utilize an alternative metabolic pathway. This finding renders these two species susceptible to different therapeutic regimens that do not affect the more common S. aureus. By using an existing antibiotic, fosmidomycin, known to target this distinct mechanism, a potent and effective method to restrict the two veterinary forms of Staphylococcus has been developed.Advantages:Selectively targets bacteria associated with veterinary skin and ear infectionsWill not contribute to interspecies transmission of drug resistanceStage of Development:In vitro proof of conceptIntellectual Property:US10,772,900Reference Media:Misic, A et al.,mSphere 2016 Sep 28, 1(5): e00258Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:16-7922-tpNCSWeb Published:2/6/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38466"

Due to their complex structures, the reported syntheses of Phorboxazole A and B analogues consist of 100 total steps with an average yield of 4%. The limited availability of these compounds has precluded the evaluation of their biological activity. As such, there is a need for improved syntheses of these compounds, featuring fewer steps while providing higher yield and selectivity.Solution:Researchers in the Smith Lab have developed a two-step, high yield (85%) method for preparing Hemi-Phorboxazole A from a known precursor.

University of Pennsylvania,Hyperpolarized Gas Delivery to Subject in MRI Scanner for Enhanced Pulmonary Diagnostics and Disease Progression Monitoring,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39340,"Device for the optimal mixing and delivery of MRI gaseous contrast agentsProblem:Gaseous contrast agents, and more specifically, hyperpolarized (HP) noble gases, such as helium-3 and xenon-129, are used for investigational imaging of respiratory gas in lungs by MRI for the purpose of assessing regional lung function. The ultimate goals of such imaging methods include diagnosis, evaluation, and monitoring progression of respiratory diseases, as well as evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.The pulmonary diseases that can benefit from such an imaging modality include obstructive lung diseases (e.g. emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and asthma) and interstitial lung diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis).Recently, sophisticated imaging methodologies have been developed based on HP gas MRI technology to extract richer and more valuable information about lung function. At the same time, these new technologies impose certain requirements on the delivery pattern and mixture content of the HP gas during the imaging session – requirements that have not yet been met. HP gases depolarize very rapidly in vivo due to interaction with other respiratory gas components and airway tissue. Depolarization of the HP gas limits the obtainable signal in MR images and has a negative effect on measurements accuracy.Solution:To address this concern, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed systems and methods that permit real-time mixing of HP gas and oxygen in order to prevent premature depolarization of the contrast gas while maintaining proper gas levels (Fi02) for the subject’s safety. The developed system further permits control of the delivered tidal volume (VT) at a specific level in order to image the lung at the same inflation volume over the sequence of several breaths, both for physiological stability and for matching images from different breaths; i.e. image co-registration.Advantages:Ensures that the same proportional amount of HP gas and oxygen is flowing into the lungs throughout the respiratory cycleEnsures proper mixing of gasesDelivers highly accurate quantitative imaging of fractional ventilation in human subjectsAllows the subject to maintain a respiratory pattern very similar to normal breathingStage of Development:Working prototypeHuman trialIntellectual Property:US9,999,756Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:Y6310-tpNCSWeb Published:3/20/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39340"
University of Pennsylvania,Repair of Radiation-Induced Bone Damage in Cancer Patients Using Sclerostin Antibody to Fix Breaks in DNA,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/23427,"Bone damage and/or fractures are common side effects of radiotherapy in cancer patients. Current treatments for radiation induced bone damage only reduce existing damage and can produce adverse side effects. On the other hand, sclerostin antibody repairs bone damage by facilitating repair of double strand breaks in DNA.Problem:Bone damage and/or fractures are common side effects of radiotherapy that pose a major health threat to cancer patients. Current treatments for radiation induced bone damage include teriparatide, raloxifine, bisphosphonates, and salmon synthetic calcitonin. These treatments inhibit bone resorption by suppressing osteoclast activity or triggering osteoclast death. Many of these approaches have adverse side effects, such as reflux disease, esophageal erosion, muscle aches, and cardiovascular events.Solution:In comparison to conventional treatments that simply reduce radiation damage, sclerostin antibody (Scl-Ab) actually repairs radiation induced bone damage. It reverses radiation damage in osteoblasts by activating the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which facilitates repair of double strand breaks in DNA.In a rat model, the administration of sclerostin antibody (Scl-Ab) injections for 4 weeks post radiation treatment significantly contributed to DNA repair, and reduced bone damage. These results suggest that Scl-Ab treatment post radiation therapy can reverse radiation-induced bone damage in a clinical setting.Advantages:Enhances DNA repair in bone following radiation treatmentAntibody well characterized and currently being tested in clinical trialsApplications:Reduction of bone damage caused by radiation therapyStage of Development:Testing in rat models has shown that injection of the sclerostin antibody (Scl-Ab) treatment for 4 weeks following radiation treatment significantly contributed to DNA repair, and reduced bone damageScl-Ab is currently being tested in clinical trialsReference Media:Chandra, A et al.J.

University of Pennsylvania,Composite materials for bone and tissue reconstruction,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/29850,"Problem:Materials used for bone transplants, and as scaffolds for tissue restoration, need particular features to work well. Current materials have shortcomings that complicate treatment.- Dried silica gels are very attractive because of their nanometer-sized pores, but they lack larger pores that exist in natural bone.- Composite materials may have larger pores, but the fibers are usually dense ceramics which are less biocompatible.There is a need for materials that combine the high surface area of dried gels with the larger pores of fibrous composites.Solution:Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a fibrous composite of biocompatible silica gels and biodegradable polymers that preserves the nanometer-sized pores in the fibers, and the bone-like pores between the fibers. The fibers can be hollow to further increase the surface area, lower the density, and provide the open channels advantageous for transport and cellular activities.The polymers form bonding and linkage at the intersections of fibers to strengthen the composites. Such composites show good mechanical strength and readily induce bone-like growth. They can be easily applied to a surface for patches or coatings.

After a stroke, people often have weakness on one side that results in an irregular gait. Many patients have difficulty adjusting to a regular gait and suffer from impaired mobility. The need for physical therapy will grow in coming years as the world cares for an ageing population.Solution:Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have created a cable-based gait rehabilitation device that could provide improved outcomes for physical therapy patients. This device consists of a harness that is worn by the user, a cable with an active braking system attached to the harness, and force sensors on the user’s foot. Sensors monitor the user’s gait, and the brake is applied to the cable to provide resistance on the swing of the weaker limb.

Shadows pose a difficult problem for machine vision and image analysis techniques, because they can hide objects and make edges unclear. Polarization information could provide enhanced object recognition, edge recognition, and detection of shadow-occluded objects.Solution:Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed an imaging technique that captures data at 3 different polarization angles using a standard camera. This method of data capture shows more information that would not be detectable by the unaided eye or a normal camera.Polarization analysis can detect objects in shadows, segment and separate complex overlapping shadows from multiple sources, and help detect edges and hidden details that would not be visible in standard intensity-based images.

A new processing technique enables low-cost, wide-area fabrication of QD thin films in a process compatible with plastic substrates.

Often the fingerprints left on objects of interest are hard to detect with the unaided eye, and they may be only partial prints or of low quality.The current technique for extracting fingerprints involves applying a powder and removing the fingerprint with tape. This method, however, is destructive of the original fingerprint and may not work well on all surfaces.Solution:Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a non-destructive imaging technique that can provide high-quality images of fingerprints suitable for forensic analysis without disturbing the original evidence.Light reflected from a surface is usually polarized at an angle, and this information can be used to perform analysis of surface discontinuities, such as the residue left by a fingerprint. Polarization imaging can help detect fingerprints that would not normally be visible, and do so with a high image quality.

However, shrinking circuits down to smaller sizes presents some difficulties as the metallic elements do not behave the same way at the nanoscale. If circuit elements could be created that operate at optical frequencies, they could be made much smaller than conventional electronics. This would require nano-scale circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors at sizes orders of magnitude smaller than today’s electronics.Solution:Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have created nanostructures that act as optical circuit elements. These nanostructures could be used for data storage and computing at scales much smaller than existing devices. The devices are fabricated using certain metals such as gold or silver that exhibit surface plasmon resonance at optical frequencies. Nanoparticles created from a combination of plasmonic (gold, silver) and non-plasmonic materials (Au2S, SiO2) can produce properties that will act as inductors, resistors, capacitors, diodes, and inverters in the optical domain.

LCA occurrence, while rare (1/50,000 – 1/33,000 of live births), is the leading cause of childhood blindness. Due to its early onset, LCA has been more challenging to treat as opposed to later onset retinopathies such as retinitis pigmentosa.To date, at least 15 different mutated genes have been associated with LCA. Of these 15 different genes, one (RPE65) is currently the subject of multiple ongoing gene therapy clinical trial studies. This particular gene mutation only accounts for approximately 16% of all LCA cases, therefore additional therapeutic approaches are needed so that a larger population of LCA patients have treatment options.Solution:Work in the laboratories of Drs. Gustavo Aguirre, William Beltran, Samuel Jacobson, and Artur Cideciyan has resulted in the development of an AAV-mediated gene therapy approach for treating LCA disorders arising from a mutation in the Nephrocystin-5 (NPHP5) gene. Using a large animal model system, the team has observed a robust recovery of retinal function and sustained vision for periods greater than 2 years after injection with the construct.Advantages:First long-term successful gene therapy of a ciliopathy causing LCA.Different AAV vectors provide effective therapeutic rescue.Successful treatment in early, mid and more advanced stages of the disease.Efficacy demonstrated in a large animal model (human-size eye) affected by a naturally-occurring form of NPHP5-LCA.Stage of Development:In vivo proof of concept demonstratedIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:16-7749-tpNCSWeb Published:2/3/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38439"

A camera that could easily incorporate polarization imaging could provide better detail and scene analysis that conventional cameras.Solution:Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have created an image sensor with real-time polarimetric extraction capability at the focal plane.A micropolarizer array mounted on the imaging sensor filters the incoming light through two polarization filters offset at 45 degrees to each other. For each given 2x2 pixel area, both light intensity and polarization information are captured.The data captured by the imaging sensor can be used to calculate the Stokes parameters which quantify the polarization of the light. A complete image sensor is made up of sets of these 2x2 pixel blocks, with the current lab prototype consisting of a 256x256 imager.

The prevalence in the U.S. is estimated at 20 cases per 100,000 people. The cause for the autoimmune response to AChRs in MG is not known.Current treatment options include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (with modest efficacy at improving neurotransmission) and nonspecific immunosuppressants (whose beneficial effects may be delayed for up to 18 months and can cause severe side effects). No specific immunosuppressive therapy is available.Solution:Dr. Jon Lindstrom and his team at Penn have developed a specific immunosuppressive therapy with great potential for treating MG. The vaccine utilizes cytoplasmic domains of human AChR subunits and incomplete Freund’s adjuvant.When tested in rat models of the experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG), which is considered the gold standard animal model for MG, the vaccine was demonstrated to be a safe and rapidly suppressed established chronic EAMG providing long-term, possibly permanent, resistance to re-induction of EAMG.

L domains are highly conserved motifs present in a wide array of RNA virus matrix proteins including filoviruses, arenaviruses, rhabdoviruses, paramyxoviruses and retroviruses, thus making these antivirals applicable to a vast assortment of human pathogens.Advantages:Broadly applicable to viruses containing L-domainLittle to no risk of viruses developing resistancNew class of ""host-oriented"" therapeuticsBrief course of treatmentStage of Development:In vitro studies with live virus and virus like particles are completeIn vitro toxicity studies are completeSAR of >150 compounds completed with two lead series identifiedNext stage is in vivo animal model studiesIntellectual Property:US10,160,756Reference Media:Lu, J et al.;J Virol. 2014 May; 88(9): 4736Han, Z et al.;J Virol. 2014 Jul; 88(13): 7294Loughran, HM et al.;Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 2016 Aug 1; 26(15): 3429Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:14-7018-tpNCSWeb Published:1/23/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38067"

A method of connecting the virtual and physical worlds could enhance design, collaboration, and entertainment in new ways. Some existing systems can represent a physical object in a virtual environment by using a RFID tag, but this is a limited solution that cannot represent the actual state or orientation of the object.Solution:Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have created a new smart block technology that connects the physical and virtual world. As the blocks are connected together, they can detect their position and orientation, as well as identify which blocks are on top and below them. The data from the blocks is relayed to a virtual representation which changes in real time as the user manipulates the blocks. In addition to merely sensing the presence of another block, putting a certain block in the right position or building a certain shape could trigger events in both the physical and virtual world.

While the initial in vitro studies have laid the groundwork for understanding the molecular function of Msi proteins, it has been a challenge to study the role of this protein family in vivo, due to functional redundancy between Msi1 and Msi2 and embryonic lethality of Msi1-/-/Msi2-/-  double knockout mice (unpublished).Research in the laboratory of Dr. Chris Lengner has resulted in the development of multiple tools for the in vivo investigation of Msi family protein function.

Macular degeneration has two main forms, Stargardt’s macular degeneration (STGD) which affects juveniles, and age related macular degeneration (AMD) which affects older individuals.While a fairly small proportion of the population has STGD, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 8,000 to 10,000, AMD affects a significantly larger segment at 2 million people in 2010 in the U.S. alone. There are currently few treatment options for macular degeneration disorders and therefore a serious need for innovative solutions.Solution:Work in the lab of Dr. Kathleen Boesze-Battaglia has resulted in a novel therapeutic approach which targets the underlying cause of macular degeneration vision loss, the accumulation of toxic lipid debris including lipofuscin.Lipofuscin is a fatty yellow pigment which builds up in cells underlying the macula, eventually causing cell death and vision loss. Utilizing a unique gene therapy method, Dr. Boesze-Battaglia has achieved a significant reduction in the amount of lipofuscin accumulation in a well-established in vivo model system.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems are also used to record glucose levels throughout the day. These systems could be unified via a closed-loop control algorithm to create an artificial pancreas that requires no input, manual blood testing, or manual dosing by the user. However, this is a difficult problem to solve because of the physical variation among individuals, the difficulty of quantifying nutrition, and the risks of serious outcomes if the incorrect dosage of insulin is given.Solution:Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a closed-loop control algorithm to enable an artificial pancreas system for Type 1 Diabetes patients. This algorithm is independent of the user’s physiology and requires no user input about nutrition. The algorithm uses past information about insulin doses provided by the pump and glucose data provided by the CGM.

The latter two aryls are inexpensive coupling partners with arylboronic acids and provide a desirable method of carbon-carbon bond formation starting from phenols.This complementary approach gives rise to the rapid synthesis of biaryls, and demonstrates the synthetic competitiveness of in situ prepared neopentylglycolborane versus that of tetra(alkoxy)diboron derivatives.Advantages:The use of Ni-based catalyst, neopentylglycolborane, and simple dppe and dppp ligands, reduce the cost compared to diboron or Pd-based catalyst methods.Novel reagent, neopentylglycolborane, has potential or broad applicability, including metal-catalyzed borylation as well as uncatalyzed hydroboration.One pot method reduces time required and processing demands to reach the end product.Applications:Novel boronic acids and boronic esters for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals, in particular those with sensitive functionality.Processing of biaryls and potentially heterobiaryls for liquid crystalline systems, organic and polymer light emitting diodes (O/PLEDS) and other organic electronic materials.The stability of neopentylglycolborane in solution should allow for its production, storage, and likely purification and commercialization of the reagent.Stage of Development:Demonstrated in laboratory conditions with a wide array of substrates as well as various bases, catalysts, and ligands, showing range of applicability.Intellectual Property:US8,530,689Reference Media:Rosen, BM et al.;Org Lett; 2008 May 17; 10(12): 2597.Wilson, DA et al.;Org Lett, 2008 Nov 6 10(21): 4879.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:U4807-tpNCSWeb Published:3/1/2019Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/31563"

""It's Match.com for shopping.""Problem:Online networks today are centered on primarily one of two premises, either a social network of “people you may know” or “customers who bought this item also bought…” recommendations. A key component missing from these networks is the person who is most similar to you as a consumer. As the ecommerce market has continued to grow, valued at $1.25 trillion dollars worldwide and $262 billion in the U.S. in 2013, retailers are constantly looking for ways set themselves apart from the competition.Solution:NETIFY is a mobile social network that delivers live, real-time social networks in any online context to consumers. The social networking algorithm constructs networks of shoppers based on a range of characteristics (demographic, behavioral, geographical, etc.). The characteristics are determined by the setting – i.e. the relevant characteristics for matching clothes shoppers on Gap.com are not the same as they are for matching grocery shoppers on WholeFoods.com. NETIFY provides the voyeuristic peek into another person’s shopping cart, allowing a customer to learn from other’s good ideas, and try them out herself. The reason this works is that it’s all in the match. By putting the right people together, we can create the right influences.Advantages:Relies on social context of users, not productsNo need to search for people relevant to the userReal-time connectionApplications:Online retailersGrocery storesFinancial servicesHealthcareStage of Development:Prototype in developmentReference Media:Centola, DScience, 2010 Sep 3; 329(5996): 1194Centola, DScience, 2011 Dec 2; 334(6060): 1269van der Leij, MJScience, 2011 Dec 2; 334(6060): 1220Zhang, J et. al.,Prev Med Rep. 2015; 2: 651Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:16-7932-tpNCSWeb Published:2/6/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38470"

These warnings might be ignored or missed by the people that need to hear them. Directed sound systems can create a narrow “beam” of sound rather than a wave that spreads in all directions. These systems work by emitting directed, high-frequency ultrasonic signal that demodulates in air, producing sound focused in a narrow beam.This technique has been known for some time, but it can only travel in a straight line perpendicular to the source. A controllable beam of sound could change the angle of the beam to track a target and direct a warning at a specific personSolution:Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have created a phased array directed speaker that can change the beam angle. By using a series of ultrasound sources, each with a different time delay, the beam can be angled and moved. This system could be used to target a specific individual and direct a warning message to one person specifically.

Currently, there is no specific therapy for acute lung injury or lung inflammation, and adjunctive strategies that modulate the deleterious effects of mechanical ventilation are needed.Solution:During lung injury, the Margulies Lab has discovered, in vitro with a rat epithelial stretch model and in vivo with ventilated rats and pigs, that protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) inhibition reduces the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) signaling pathway that is induced upon mechanical stretch. Upon mechanical stretch, PERK is phosphorylated and initiates the signaling cascade. PERK inhibition in the ISR pathway improves mechanical stretch-induced epithelial monolayer permeability, mitigating mechanical stretch-induced cell death and tight junction dissociation. Inhibiting the ISR pathway in vivo may reduce acute lung injury during large tidal volume ventilation.This work represents the first implication of the PERK pathway in lung injury, as well as a new use of a commercially available PERK inhibitor previously connected with cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, and diseases with activated unfolded protein response pathways.Advantages:Use commercially available PERK inhibitor for alternate indication to treat lung injury and inflammationNew method of use for existing compoundSafety previously tested in humansPotential therapeutic where one does not exist for this conditionApplications:Acute lung injuryVentilator-induced lung injuryAcute respiratory distress syndromeLung inflammationStage of Development:Proof-of-concept and in vivo testingIntellectual Property:US11,026,945Reference MediaDolinay, T et al.;Respir Res 2018 Aug 22 19(1): 157.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:16-7828-tpNCSWeb Published:2/5/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38449"

HAMR operates by heating the disk with a laser, which momentarily changes the storage medium’s magnetic coercivity, allowing data to be written to the disk at a higher density than conventional methods.Hard disks are currently coated with a protective outer layer of hydrogenated amorphous carbon, which degrades above 150C. Finding a suitable disk coating material that can survive high temperatures without interfering with magnetic recording and data retrieval will be a key enabling technology for HAMR.Solution:Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a new coating that could provide several advantages for HAMR-enabled hard drives. In this process, a thin (2nm) layer of Silicon Oxide-doped diamond-like carbon (SiO DLC) is deposited onto the disk as a replacement for the amorphous carbon layer. This material is highly temperature resistant and can withstand the temperatures required for HAMR without degrading.

Different electrical fields can be applied to change the conductivity of certain regions of a graphene layer. The change in conductivity results in controlled optical properties for graphene metamaterials.

However, typing using a touchscreen is often imprecise, resulting in a slower typing speed and frequent errors. When the touchscreen keyboard opens it covers half the screen, obscuring content the user may wish to see. These frustrations are well known to any smartphone user, and typing on a touchscreen is still not as fast or easy as using a computer keyboard.Solution:Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a Keyboard Alternative Technology (KAT) for fast and easy typing on mobile devices. KAT consists of touch sensors on the back of the phone, with an onscreen character map and swipe gestures used for input.The user holds the phone with two fingers of each hand on the backside of the phone. By swiping up, down, left, and right, a character is selected for input, with the thumbs on the front side of the phone used for scrolling and selection. The number of available swipe gestures combined with selection for special characters allows the KAT system to produce a total of 228 characters, more than enough for the full set of 128 ASCII characters or the 101-key QWERTY keyboard.

A way to temporarily adhere to surfaces during assembly would open up new methods of manufacturing for semiconductors, electronics, and other products.Solution:Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a new tunable composite material with high adhesion under normal loading and weak adhesion when shear is applied, making the surface adhesion easily controllable.A micro-scale composite structure is patterned using a stiff post surrounded by a compliant core. A contact surface made up of an array of these posts has strong adhesion in the normal direction but can be easily removed by applying a shear force. This makes manipulation of thin layers of delicate material possible, because no damaging handling forces are applied, and no residue is left behind.Adhesive contact surfaces that use this method can easily be produced on a large scale, making this technology a practical solution as an applied process improvement.Advantages:Control over adhesion with no residue or handling damageEasy to manufacture and scale to component-size structuresStage of Development:Prototype developed on the scale of 1.5” x 1.5”Intellectual Property:US10,549,483Reference Media:Minsky, H.

If the data arrives late the system may not function as intended. Heavy traffic or a denial of service attack can quickly overwhelm a network and cause downtime for critical assets.With current software tools, users can request quality of service through middleware platforms, but there is no way to guarantee delivery of the required quality of service.Solution:A real-time message bus called MIDAS developed at the University of Pennsylvania uses Software Defined Networking (SDN) protocols to automatically configure the network and deliver real-time guarantees of quality of service. This tool ensures that latency and quality requirements for critical network functions are maintained. The user can specify maximum end-to-end bounds for latency which are enforced by the middleware tool.The OpenFlow protocol, compatible with most consumer networking equipment, is used to communicate with networked assets. When a new asset comes online its requirements are checked against the network configuration and the other network priorities. If the new request can be added without violating other quality of service requirements, that new configuration is committed to the network, otherwise the request is denied. This prevents overload and allows quality of service to be guaranteed across a network.Advantages:Guaranteed latency and quality of serviceAvoids network overload caused by heavy traffic or DoS attacksAutomates functions that would normally require the attention of a network administratorKing, A.

TOG could be used as a biomarker in basic research and clinical studies, and also could be used as a biomarker to measure the efficiency of various drugs which are being developed to treat asthma and cardiovascular disease.Intellectual Property:US8,748,121Reference Media:Zhu, P., et al.Free Radic Biol Med. 2009 Oct 1;47(7):953Case ID:S3993-tpNCDWeb Published:3/5/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39081"
University of Pennsylvania,Ex-Vivo Method to Maintain Hematopoietic Stem Cells,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39288,"An efficient way to improve outcomes of bone marrow and umbilical cord blood transplants to increase survival in blood cancer patients. The invention works by expanding hematopoietic stem cells in culture using a defined medium with specific inhibitor combinations.Problem:Expanding hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is paramount in stem cell research and for clinical use of HSCs. However, HSC homeostasis is not well understood and methods for HSC expansion have so far required the use of complex and expensive cocktails of cytokines and/or support cells.Solution:Dr. Klein and his team developed a method to expand and maintain HSCs ex-vivo using available GSK3 and mTOR inhibitors potentially enabling production of a greater number of long term HSCs without the use of exogenous hematopoietic cytokines and other factors. This combination, in mice, increases the number of HSCs, improves the frequency of engraftment, and shortens the time to hematopoietic recovery in transplant recipients. Additionally, these novel culture conditions offer an excellent research tool to explore HSC biology.Advantages:Maintenance and expansion of HSCs without inducing cell lineage commitmentMaintenance and expansion of HSCs without the need for cytokinesUse of clinically approved drugsApplications:Pre-treatment to increase efficacy of bone marrow transplantationPre-treatment to increase efficacy and survival rate of UCB transplantationPotential use to expand and maintain other stem cellsPotential research tool to expand HSCs that may be applied to other adult stem cellsStage of Development:Ex-vivo maintenance of HSCs, including cord blood HSCsIn-vivo data showing improved survival of recipients who received HSCs cultured in inhibitor combination.Intellectual Property:US9,050,315US9,452,187Reference Media:Huang, J. et al.;J Clin Invest, 2009, 119(12): 3519.Huang, J. et al.;Nat Med, 2012, 18(12): 1778.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:W5373-tpNCSWeb Published:3/17/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39288"
University of Pennsylvania,Naturally Derived Vaccine Adjuvant and Immunostimulant for Use in Humans and Animals,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/21824,"Unique RNA molecule derived from defective viral genomes containing potent immunostimulatory and adjuvant propertiesProblem:The vaccine industry is steadily moving away from live-attenuated and whole-pathogen products, mostly due to safety concerns. As this trend continues, there is a need for new adjuvants in the marketplace to help boost the immunogenicity of the modern vaccine. For 70 years, the only approved adjuvant was aluminum, whose mechanism of action is still unknown. Over the years, many other adjuvants have been proposed but most have failed to be successful, at least in humans, due to toxicity, cost and stability.Solution:Dr. Lopez has optimized a short RNA motif (DDO) contained in naturally occurring replication defective viral genomes which contains exceptional immunostimulatory activity. This motif is stable, short in length, lacks the ability to replicate and is easily produced. DDOs can be modified, and transferred to other RNAs and vaccine viral vectors to enhance their activity. In addition, it can be combined with delivery/depot adjuvants for enhanced activity and targeting.While most classical adjuvants largely target the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, the DDO operates through a distinct molecular pathway. This feature allows for the molecule to be used either singly or in combination with a traditional adjuvant for a synergistic effect. Taken together, this unique molecule is versatile in its applications and robust in its immunostimulatory capacity making it an ideal vaccine adjuvant.Advantages:StableCost-effectiveMultiple delivery mechanismsActivates a non-Toll receptor signaling pathwayCan be used alone or in combination with other adjuvantsStage of Development:Demonstrated in vivo and in vitroIntellectual Property:US10,624,964Reference Media:Xu, J et al.mBio, 2015 Oct 6; 6(5): e01265Mercado-Lopez, X et al.Vaccine, 2013 Nov 19; 31(48): 5713Desired Partnerships:Co-developmentCase ID:15-7499-tpNCSWeb Published:4/28/2016Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/21824"

University of Pennsylvania,Nanowire phase change memory,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39287,"Problem:Phase Change Memory (PCM) is a leading contender to replace flash memory. In PCM devices, a material is heated to undergo glass transition, changing back and forth between the amorphous and crystalline state. However, existing PCM devices have experienced problems with reliability and threshold voltage drift. In order to make commercially viable PCM devices, better solutions are required.Solution:Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a nanowire-based PCM that shows better stress relaxation, and thus better long term reliability, than thin-film devices. The researchers discovered that stress relaxation behavior is the key cause of time-dependent drift in PCM device properties, which results in poor reliability. The design of the new PCM device uses exposed nanowires rather than conventional embedded thin films. These free-standing nanowires show much less long-term drift than thin film devices. The large surface area of the nanowires allows them to quickly and efficiently relax stress after phase change, resulting in better performance.Advantages:Faster relaxation of residual stressesBetter long term reliability and reduced temporal driftStage of Development:PrototypeIntellectual Property:US8,759,810Reference Media:Mitra, M., et al.;Appl Phys Lett, 96(22), 222111.Desired Partnerships:LicenseSponsored ResearchCase ID:W5329-tpNCSWeb Published:3/17/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39287"

A network of cameras could track objects by establishing where targets are moving in each camera’s field of view. However, without a way to know where cameras and their targets are in relation to each other, it is difficult to accurately track an object.Solution:Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a way to localize smart cameras and track objects. Cameras that are in each other’s field of view can communicate with each other by sending pulsed infrared signals. Information about the camera position can be determined and the location of tracked objects can be established through triangulation.Using this technique, a network of cameras can communicate with each other and establish their spatial orientation to track moving objects. This technology could be used to create smart surveillance systems that can track targets spread across a building or a larger area.Advantages:Establishes spatial orientation of cameras relative to each otherTargets can be tracked as they move from one camera’s field of view to anotherAllows for smart, networked surveillance systemsStage of Development:Prototype systemIntellectual Property:US7,421,113US7,522,765Desired Partnerships:LicenseSponsored ResearchCase ID:R3779-tpNCSWeb Published:3/5/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39079"
University of Pennsylvania,Diamond waveguides for photonic devices,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38437,"Problem:Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) can transmit information for computing using light rather than electricity. Using PICs on chips would allow for faster data transmission rates, lower power consumption, and less energy wasted through thermal dissipation. Diamond is a promising material for PICs due to its optical properties, however, fabrication difficulties have impeded progress in this area.Solution:Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a new fabrication method for diamond waveguides that could be integrated with standard CMOS processing. This would allow easier integration of photonic elements with standard integrated circuits. The fabrication technique surrounds a high refractive index material (diamond) with a low index material (SiO2), with an additional intermediate index cladding (Si3N4) over the top of the waveguide. This geometry and composition produces full confinement of a single optical mode in the waveguide.Difficulties associated with the current diamond-on-insulator approach are avoided with this new fabrication technique. Crucially, this waveguide structure is much better suited that the prior art to integration with CMOS processing, allowing photonic and electronic devices to be easily fabricated on the same chip. Producing a highly confined single mode waveguide with fewer fabrication issues than the prior art would be of great value in this emerging area.Advantages:Compatibility with CMOS componentsEasier scaling and manufacturing of photonic componentsStage of Development:PrototypeReference Media:Grote, R & Bassett, L;APL Photonics 2016 Aug 1; 1(7): 1302Intellectual Property:US10,585,243Case ID:16-7722-tpNCSWeb Published:2/3/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38437"

However, most objects such as a yoga mat or dumbbells have no “smart” capabilities – they cannot monitor the user’s actions or progress. Adding sensing and interactive components to this equipment can allow for a more personalized interactive experience.Solution:Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed content-coupled objects that can track the user’s actions and provide feedback to a computer-controlled interactive program. As an example, the group has developed an interactive yoga mat that can sense the placement of a user’s feet and hands to determine the pose. This information is sent to the content display to pace the flow of an instructional video.Rather than proceeding at a fixed pace, the content can be displayed at the user’s own pace for people who are more or less experienced. Beginners who need more time can proceed at a slower pace as the flow of the content is based on the user’s actual movements. A display built into the mat can guide the user’s hands and feet to the correct pose.

University of Pennsylvania,Visible light absorbing ferroelectric materials for photovoltaics,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39319,"Problem:In the search for new routes to renewable sources of energy, fabrication of higher –performing, environment-friendly and chemically stable materials is constantly being pursued. Improving the efficiency of utilizing solar energy, the most abundant energy source, is expected to require the design of new photovoltaic materials that can absorb light in the whole UV-visible spectral range. Ferroelectic materials may provide a promising solution.Solution:Ferroelectrics have been attractive in the area of energy storage as they allow for coupling of light absorption with other functional properties. Dr. Andrew Rappe’s work has resulted into a family of single-phase solid oxide solutions that are low-cost, nontoxic, and most importantly, are able to access a wider range of bandgaps from 1.1 to 3.8 electronvolts. This allows these materials to capture a larger percentage of the solar spectrum, and suggest they may be a viable alternative to conventional semiconductor p-n junction solar cells for solar energy conversion.Technology Overview:The invention covers the bandgap engineering strategy wherein two different transition-metal cations located on the perovskite B-site create ferroelectric perovskites with low bandgaps, with one cation driving ferroelectricity and the other giving a bandgap in the visible range. The solid solutions were synthesized by standard solid-state synthesis and synchrotron X-ray diffraction was used to show the formation of a stable perovskite for all the solutions.

University of Pennsylvania,Robust Smart Windows: Reversible switching from transparent to color,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38389,"Problem:Commercial buildings in the United States alone account for nearly 40% of the total energy consumption. Among them, electricity is the largest energy source for buildings. Therefore, the design of new energy efficient materials and technologies is crucial to meet goals such as the Net-Zero Energy Commercial Building Initiative (CBI) put forward by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Approaches to block or reflect intense sunlight when needed, and to capture the sun’s light and heat when desirable, remain complex and expensive to fabricate.Solution:A low cost, durable composite film used as a window “shade” where the transparency can be tailored to adjust heat and light. The film could also be mounted between two panes of glass and motor controlled.Technology Overview:A composite film consisting of a thin layer of quasi-amorphous array of silica nanoparticles (NPs) is embedded in a bulk elastomeric polymer film.It is highly transparent (>90% transmittance in the visible wavelength) in the initial state.Upon mechanical stretching, the transmittance is dramatically reduced to 30% and displays angle-independent structural color at a strain >30%.The displayed reflective color is a so-called structural color, which could be tuned by the silica NP size; the color displayed is invariant with the applied strain.The switch between transparency and colored states has been reversibly cycled over 1000 times without losing the film’s structural and optical integrity.Advantages:The initial state is transparent vs. technologies such as polymer dispersed liquid crystals and electrochromic displays.The switch between transparency and colored states has been reversibly cycled at least 1000 times without losing the film’s structural and optical integrity.The “window” can be massproduced using low-cost methods from abundant materials.In addition to light blocking smart windows, it can also be used for display or security applications.Intellectual Property:USPendingPCTPendingReference Media:Ge, D et al.;Adv Mater 2015 Apr, 27(15): 2489Case ID:15-7442-tpNCSWeb Published:1/31/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38389"
University of Pennsylvania,Drug Discovery and Target Identification Platform Technology Using Random shRNA-Expressing Library,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39324,"shRNA library of 3 million sequences for identification of small-RNA therapeutic candidates, new targets and pathways, as well as conventional chemical-compound drugs in cell-culture disease models.Problem:ShRNA Drug Discovery: RNA interference (RNAi) using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) is commonly used to inhibit gene expression. shRNA-expressing libraries may have important applications in identifying RNA molecules/sequences with specific biological activity and thus therapeutic implications. Typically, shRNA libraries are limited to sequences that target single mRNAs. Because 7-nucleotide “seed” sequences within shRNAs are sufficient for partial inhibition of target mRNAs, shRNAs are inherently promiscuous. Thus, the single-gene-targeting approach is complicated by off-target effects, which diminish therapeutic indices, and fails to take advantage of multi-gene targeting, which enhances potency.Discovery of Drugs, Targets, and Pathways: Traditional drug discovery process involving high-throughput screening is labor-intensive, expensive, often ineffective, and infeasible when cell-culture disease models are unsuitable for microtiter-plate formats.Solution:ShRNA Drug Discovery: To challenge the single-gene-targeting paradigm of small-RNA-based therapeutic initiatives, Dr. Wilson’s lab designed, synthesized, validated, and now further optimized shRNA-expressing libraries that are completely random at the nucleotide level.Three million shRNAs can be screened in a single tissue-culture flask, selecting for the desired phenotype with “hit” sequences retrieved by PCR. Because the libraries are completely random, the screens are unbiased: favorable cell phenotypes reveal which shRNAs are most effective and least toxic. This approach allows identification of sequences that target multiple genes and/or act through non-canonical mechanisms.Discovery of Drugs, Targets, and Pathways: Random shRNA library screening can be combined with bioinformatic pattern analyses of hit sequences to identify targets, pathways, and conventional chemical-compound therapeutic candidates, bypassing in vivo delivery issues. Thus, each phenotypic screen has the potential to identify, (i) small-RNA therapeutic candidates, (ii) conventional, chemical-compound therapeutic candidates, (iii) target candidates for conventional drug development, and (iv) information on pathways relevant to disease mechanisms.Advantages:Screening, by phenotypic selection, of 3 million shRNAs in a single tissue-culture flaskScreening for efficacy, and lack of toxicity, simultaneouslyHit-optimization by random mutagenesis and re-screeningTranslation, using bioinformatics, of gene-expression profiles of “hit” shRNAs to existing drugsInexpensive, simplified, fast method compared to high throughput screeningAbility to run positive and negative (cancer) screensUtilization of  cell-culture disease models unsuitable for microtiter-plate formatsApplications:Identification of shRNA sequences that confer phenotypes of interest or modulate specific biological parametersIdentification of novel targets, pathways and existing drugs through bioinformatic pattern analysesDevelopment of novel therapeutics and biologic tools for a variety of diseases, including, e.g.Viral illnesses, by selecting for cell survival in viral cell-culture modelsCystic Fibrosis, by selecting for increased surface expression of F508del CFTRTRAIL-insensitive Malignancies, by selecting for increased surface expression of the TRAIL receptorHypercholesteremia, by selecting for increased surface expression of the LDL receptorParkinson Disease, by selecting for increased expression of PGC1-alphaType II Diabetes, by selecting for protection against inducers of ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR)Stage of Development:Synthesized, validated, and optimized library of 3 million sequencesIdentified shRNAs protecting an IL3-dependent cell line from IL3 withdrawalIdentified shRNAs that reverse phenotypic defects of Friedreich ataxia (FA) fibroblastsIdentified novel targets and existing drugs that reverse phenotypic defects of FA fibroblastsIntellectual Property:AU2007223980JP5463039EP2002037US9,163,231WO2015/020990US9,982,256US10,260,065US11,371,041Reference Media:Wang, Y et al.;PLoS One. 2014 Feb 3; 9(2):e87390Wang, Y et al.;PLoS One. 2008 Sept 9; 3(9):e3171Cotticelli, MG et al.;J Biomol Screen, 2015 Oct; 20(9): 1084Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:Y6140-tpNCSWeb Published:3/19/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39324"

University of Pennsylvania,Repurposing of FDA-approved HER-inhibiting therapies for acute lung injury treatment,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/45151,"Mitigating ventilator-induced lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome through HER2/HER3 signaling pathwayProblem:Acute lung injury, such as that induced by long-term treatment with a mechanical ventilator, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) affects 190,000 patients per year in the United States, with associated mortality of 35-40%. The highest numbers of deaths are in patients with sepsis, pneumonia, or aspiration. ARDS is characterized by sudden breathlessness within hours to days of an inciting event, including trauma, sepsis, drug overdose, blood transfusion, and aspiration. ARDS is a life-threatening condition caused by widespread inflammation of the lungs that can lead to multisystem organ failure. Currently, there is no specific therapy for acute lung injury, and adjunctive strategies that modulate the deleterious effects of mechanical ventilation are needed.Solution:During mechanically-induced traumatic lung injury, the Margulies Lab has discovered, using cyclically stretched tissue and ventilated rats, that the HER (human epidermal growth factor receptor) family of genes, which regulates primary cellular signaling pathways, is upregulated during large stretch. The release of NRG1 (neuregulin) upon stretch induction binds to HER3, initiating HER2/HER3 heterodimerization and activation, which then initiates downstream signaling cascades, producing a “leaky” epithelium.The Margulies Lab has in vitro and in vivo preclinical evidence that reducing NRG1 release, inhibiting NRG1/HER3 binding or HER2/HER3 heterodimerization and activation prevents ventilator-induced lung injury by protecting the epithelial barrier properties during stretch. Thus, FDA-approved HER-inhibiting cancer therapies currently in use or in clinical trials may be repurposed to reduce the incidence or severity of ventilator-induced lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome.Advantages:Use FDA-approved cancer drugs for alternate indicationSafety in humans previously studiedPotential therapeutic where one does not exist for this conditionApplications:Acute lung injuryVentilator-induced lung injuryAcute respiratory distress syndromeReproduced from Ware LB et al.

University of Pennsylvania,Phytochelatin-based heavy metal detoxification in phytoremediation and agricultural applications,,,https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38454,"AtPCS gene encoding multispecific heavy metal resistance factor from plantsProblem:Environmental contamination with heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, lead and/or mercury is implicated in human disease and agricultural losses. Industrial and mining activities, as well as natural mineral outcrops, have resulted in the contamination of soils and groundwater with heavy metals that are taken up by crops to decrease agricultural productivity and enter the human food chain. There is an urgent need for environmental cleanup to improve crop yield and decrease the heavy metal content of harvestable crops.The use of plants to extract heavy metals from the environment, in a process termed phytoremediation, is particularly appealing due to its low cost and the ease with which plants can be harvested, in contrast with conventional physical and chemical methods for environmental cleanup, which carry a price tag upward of $200 billion in the US alone.Solution:Professor Rea and colleagues have identified genes encoding multispecific heavy metal resistance factors from plants. These factors are involved in the synthesis of a class of peptides that play an important role in heavy metal tolerance by binding to heavy metals and decreasing their free concentrations. Transgenic plants expressing these genes can be used to remove heavy metals from the soil. In addition or alternatively, expression of these genes in a non-harvestable part of a plant can decrease the level of heavy metals in the harvestable parts. This discovery has significant market potential in agriculture and environmental safety applications.Advantages:More efficient, less expensive method to remove heavy metals from contaminated soils and groundwaterPotential for remediation of a broad range of heavy metalsBroaden and enhance the range of tools available for environmental remediationApplications:Transgenic plants for phytoremediationTransgenic arable crops with diminished heavy metal levels in their harvestable partsNew strategies for directed metabolic pathway engineeringGeneral structure of a representative phytochelatin (PC) synthesized by the AtPCS1 gene product phytochelatin synthase.  The example shown is PC2, which contains two γ-glutamylcysteine repeats.  PC synthase, which localizes to the cytoplasm, catalyzes the heavy metal-activated synthesis of PCs to yield heavy metal-PC complexes that are transported into the vacuole.Stage of Development:Proof-of-conceptIntellectual Property:US10,370,675Reference Media:Cahoon, R et al.J.

Currently, researchers visually inspect for high frequency oscillations.Solution:An algorithm to automatically extract quantitative local seizure information from multielectrode data. The automated HFO detection and classification algorithm is comprised of three major stages:-  In the first stage, candidate HFO events are detected in the band-pass filtered iEEG.-  In the second stage, a statistical model of the local background iEEG surrounding each candidate event is built. Events bearing too large a spectral similarity to the background activity according to the model are discarded from candidacy.-  In the final stage, computational features are extracted from the retained candidates and these features are used, after a dimensionality reduction step, as inputs to a classifier.Advantages:Algorithm may process brain oscillations within the 100-500 Hz frequency range, action potentials and epileptic spikes, and other brain/body generated signalsAlgorithm may be implemented in intracranial electroencephalographic monitoring systems or brain-implantable devicesAlgorithm may enable quantitative seizure localization in devicesApplications:Intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) monitoring systems used in surgical evaluation for epilepsy patients who are unresponsive to antiepileptic drugsBrain-implantable devices that monitor, predict, abort, and/or control epileptic seizures by using the feedback to deliver a therapyStage of Development:Algorithm is developedContinuous long-term data from 9 patients has been usedIntellectual Property:U.S.9,236,698Reference Media:Blanco, J et al.;J Neurophysiol, 2010 Nov 104(5): 2900.Case ID:X5675-tpNCSWeb Published:3/18/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39309"
