The significance of theranostics therefore lies in its ability to personalize and optimize medical treatments by tailoring them to individual patients.\nB7H3 is a transmembrane protein, that has recently been identified as a pan-cancer antigen with dense expression across a multitude of cancer types and with restricted expression in normal tissue, rendering B7H3-targeted radiotheranostics a viable treatment option for millions of patients.\nDespite the promise of B7H3, no peptide ligands have been identified. Furthermore, because the protein lacks structural and functional characterization there is currently no a priori way to design ligands.\nStanford researchers have discovered B7H3-targeting peptides from peptide phage display that can be used for cancer theranostic applications, such as for diagnostic imaging and peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy. This would allow for both the diagnosis and treatment of various advanced or refractory cancers lacking other viable therapies.\nThe newly identified peptide is the first peptide identified specific to B7H3, and when chelated to 68Ga and 177Lu, the first radionuclide therapy for B7H3. Researchers predict that the B7H3 peptide-targeted radiotherapeutics would have preferential uptake in tumor tissue where the majority of DNA damage would occur, with timely elimination from clearance organs.\nStage of Development\nIn vitro and in vivo: proof of concept in cell lines\n\nApplications: Cancer diagnostic, Radionuclide cancer therapy, Cancer theranostics.\n\nAdvantages: Cost effective synthesis, Can be used to diagnose and treat a range of resistant and refractory cancer types, Favorable pharmacokinetics, First peptides identified specific to B7H3\n\nCan chelate 68Ga and 177Lu for radionuclide therapy, Can chelate 68Ga and 177Lu for radionuclide therapy."

This technology enables the first wide-field lifetime camera that is compatible with single-molecule microscopy.\nExisting sensors for wide-field nanosecond imaging (e.g. time-of-flight cameras, SPAD arrays, and gated intensifiers) sacrifice performance and are not compatible with low-light applications in bioimaging and fluorescence microscopy. The researchers have demonstrated the use of electro-optic wide-field imaging gates for nanosecond temporal resolution with high photon collection efficiency. Their method enables wide-field FLIM in a single exposure image on any standard camera sensor. By acquiring all pixels in parallel they demonstrate 5 orders of magnitude improvement in imaging speeds compared to single photon counting.

Current fast camera sensors have significant drawbacks and achieve nanosecond resolution only by sacrificing performance and sensitivity. Low-cost nanosecond camera sensors with favorable performance and form-factor are more desirable, especially for applications in LIDAR and fluorescence lifetime imaging.\nThe Kasevich lab has developed resonant electro-optic imaging techniques and optimized the design of electro-optic crystals to allow compact, low-cost, and wide angular field-of-view imaging.

Stanford University,Engineering functional cardiac tissue using a twist-expand mechanical bioreactor,Docket #: S23-545,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/engineering-functional-cardiac-tissue-using-twist-expand-mechanical-bioreactor,"Stanford researchers have invented a twist-expand mechanical bioreactor that provides an appropriate in vitro microenvironment for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived cardiomyocytes to achieve biomimetic anisotropic alignment and form contractile cardiac tissue.\nMany studies have successfully demonstrated directed differentiation of iPSCs into cardiomyocytes. However, further assembling and maturing the iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to mimic the mechanics of the native heart tissue remains a challenge. To overcome this challenge, studies have created microenvironments resembling that of primary cardiomyocytes during development: micropillar structures were placed to provide a 3D environment and exogenous cues were applied to facilitate anisotropic alignment of cells for coordinated contraction and electrical conduction. The engineered tissue's maturation was improved but still not comparable to the native heart.\nResearchers at Stanford have devised a platform that provides a more biomimetic microenvironment (Figure 1). Using advanced 3D bioprinting technology, cells were printed with soft silicone in preferred arrangements. The print was placed in an electrically conductive bioreactor that can be actuated to apply torsional force or pneumatic pressure to the silicone to introduce twisting and contractile cardiac mechanics that the micropillar approach neglected to include. This system has the potential to form functional macro-level heart tissues from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.\nStage of Development\nPrototype\n\nApplications: Cardiac tissue engineering, Drug testing, Disease modeling, Developmental studies.\n\nAdvantages: Mimics the complex contractile pattern of the native heart tissue better than other existing systems, Potential for personalized treatment."
Stanford University,Modeling human sensory ascending pathway in assembloids derived from human pluripotent stem cells,Docket #: S23-071,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/modeling-human-sensory-ascending-pathway-assembloids-derived-human-pluripotent-stem,"The ascending somatosensory pathway transmits sensory information, including pain, touch and itch, from the peripheral nervous system to the brain. Dysfunctions in this pathway are linked to disorders like peripheral neuropathy and autism spectrum disorder. Despite a significant need for effective therapeutics modulating pain and other somatosensory modalities, clinical translation remains challenging, which is likely related to species-specific features and the lack of in vitro models to directly probe and manipulate this polysynaptic pathway.\nTo remedy this issue, Stanford researchers have developed the first human ascending sensory pathway model using assembloids. The method involves differentiating human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells into regionalized neural organoids resembling the components of the human sensory ascending pathway (Figure 1). This model provides a unique opportunity to directly study and manipulate the human sensory ascending pathway, overcoming previous challenges. This platform also enables functional analysis, including synchronized neural activity across the entire sensory pathway, offering a powerful tool for drug discovery targeting sensory disorders.\nFigure:\nFigure description: Building human ascending somatosensory assembloid from human induced pluripotent stem cells.\nImage Credit: inventors\nStage of Development\nProof of concept- models have shown to trigger and ascend the full sensory pathway\n\nApplications: Autism spectrum disorder, Peripheral neuropathy, Research mechanisms of sensory processing and pathogenesis, Identification of novel therapeutic targets.\n\nAdvantages: First human cellular model of the ascending sensory pathway, Human-Specific Sensory Circuitry: Provides the first in vitro model that resembles the human ascending somatosensory pathway, overcoming the limitations of species differences in animal models., Comprehensive Functional Analysis: Enables simultaneous monitoring of neural activity across multiple interconnected regions (sensory, spinal, thalamic, and cortical) through calcium imaging and extracellular recordings., Targeted Disease Modeling and Therapeutic Screening: Allows for the study of sensory disorders, such as pain insensitivity, through genetic manipulation (e.g., SCN9A knockout) and offers a platform for high-throughput drug discovery targeting human sensory pathways.."
Stanford University,Composition and Method for Autonomous RNA Switches for Translational Control,Docket #: S23-162,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/composition-and-method-autonomous-rna-switches-translational-control,"Stanford scientists have discovered that the untranslated region (UTR) of RNA can be engineered into autonomous switches capable of both sensing native biological conditions (e.g. T cell activation) and promptly responding by initiating the translation of a therapeutic sequence (e.g. a chimeric antigen receptor). Autonomous mRNA switches can provide dynamic regulation within cellular immunotherapies and offer broad utility in next-generation mRNA therapeutics, such as engineering chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in vivo.\nEx vivo CAR T cell therapy has shown significant success in treating oncology patients and combating malignant tumors. However, this approach is limited by the expensive and time-consuming ex vivo production process, which can take several weeks, and the challenge of administering only a single effective dose to patients, leading to potential tumor relapse. In contrast, in vivo CAR T cell therapy offers a promising solution by directly engineering T cells within patients using mRNA therapeutics. This innovative approach enables rapid and customizable production, with the transient nature of mRNA therapies allowing for precise temporal control of therapeutic doses. Nevertheless, advancements are needed to develop technologies capable of sensing relevant biological conditions and tightly regulating the translation of therapeutic payloads. Novel strategies for controlling mRNA expression in T cells will enable the development of in vivo T cell therapies that can alleviate T cell dysfunction while preserving the protective immune responses required for human health.\nNovel engineered UTR sequences resulted in RNA elements that can sense T cell signals and modulate therapeutic mRNA expression as ON/OFF switches. These mRNA switches have been shown to induce the translation of genetic payloads upon T-cell activation. The use of these mRNA switches to control the translation of a CAR in engineered T cells resulted in the expression of the CAR and the killing of antigen-positive tumor cells. Importantly, when co-cultured with antigen-negative cells, there was no difference in CAR expression or killing when compared to baseline. Consequently, autonomous mRNA switches have the potential to enhance cellular immunotherapies and enable the development of in vivo CAR T cell therapies.\nStage of Development:\nPreclinical – in vitro data\nContinued research – in vivo demonstration of efficacy and further description of switches that capture other immune cell states (e.g. T cell exhaustion, NK cell activation, etc.). The inventors have demonstrated that the switch works efficiently with viral delivery methods, and future work will demonstrate its utility with non-viral delivery methods in various molecular forms.\n\nApplications: Production of mRNA switches that can sense and respond to native biological conditions (e.g. T cell activation), Synthetic regulation of therapeutic payloads in situ, Engineering of cellular immunotherapies in vivo.\n\nAdvantages: Precise control of the translation of genetic payloads, Rapid and customizable production of mRNA switches, Flexible temporal control of therapeutic dosing due to the transient nature of mRNA."
Stanford University,One-Time Delivery of Genetically Engineered Stem Cells Enable Long-Term Secretion of Therapeutic Antibodies for Treatment of HIV-1,Docket #: S23-412,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/one-time-delivery-genetically-engineered-stem-cells-enable-long-term-secretion,"Stanford researchers have engineered hematopoietic stem cells to provide long-term secretion of chosen therapeutic antibodies, eliminating the need of repeated dosing for delivery.\nThirty nine million people worldwide are living with HIV infection. Autologous transplantation of specific hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is the only known cure for HIV-1 infection. However, this treatment is extremely limited due to the rarity of specific matched donors, the morbidities associated with allogeneic transplantation, and the prevalence of HIV-1 strains resistant to select gene knockout treatments alone.\nTo circumvent these limitations, Stanford researchers genetically engineered HSPCs that secrete antibodies against various targets, including but not limited to HIV, PCSK9, and TNF-alpha. The genetically engineered HSPCs can be delivered via a one-time therapy through autologous transplantation. This technology could be used to develop autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapies for the long-term delivery of therapeutic antibodies for various diseases. The engineered cells also have the potential to improve current commercial treatment strategies that address long-term control of HIV-1 infection; A disease that currently requires lifetime administration of antiretroviral therapy.\nStage of research\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Secrete antibodies against various targets (i.e. HIV, PCSK9, and TNF-alpha), Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapies, Research tool for control of HIV-1, Development of antibody treatment therapies.\n\nAdvantages: Long-term secretion/sustained delivery of chosen therapeutic antibodies without repeated dosing, Can express multiple antibodies simultaneously, Limited comparable cell-based products currently on the market."
Stanford University,G-I-ntelligent pill (GIntellipill) for active sample collection in the gastrointestinal tract,Docket #: S24-095,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/g-i-ntelligent-pill-gintellipill-active-sample-collection-gastrointestinal-tract,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed an ingestible smart pill to sample biomarkers from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\nThe GI tract plays an important role in maintaining overall health, as it is responsible for digesting food, absorbing nutrients, and eliminating waste. Sampling from the GI tract, particularly its mucous layer, is essential in understanding gut health and disease. Bioanalytes from the mucus can provide insights into inflammation, metabolic function, and immune response. Currently, invasive procedures like endoscopy and colonoscopy are used to sample from the GI tract. There is a need for a non-invasive method. Smart pills have recently emerged as non-invasive sampling platforms. However, to date, they have relied on passive diffusion and thus are not suitable for viscous mucus.\nStanford researchers have designed a smart pill that can be swallowed and docked at a desired location in the GI tract for active sampling of the mucus. After confirming the pill's location within the GI tract, its hydrodynamic screw is remotely actuated. The rotational motion facilitates the collection of mucus samples along its spiral path, directing them towards a dedicated collection chamber. This technology could enable easy, simple, affordable, and repeat sampling of GI tract regions of interest.\nStage of Development\nPrototype\n\nApplications: Precision medicine, Early disease detection, Health monitoring, Disease management.\n\nAdvantages: Can collect high viscosity samples, Multiple sampling locations, Cost-effective, Non-invasive, Enables frequent high quality data collection."
Stanford University,Spinner Device for Kidney Stone and Dust Removal,Docket #: S24-093,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/spinner-device-kidney-stone-and-dust-removal,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed a novel kidney stone extraction device that can be used during ureteroscopy to simultaneously remove kidney stone fragments and dust without affecting renal pressure.\nKidney stones are clusters of minerals and salts that form in the urinary tract, potentially causing severe pain from urinary tract obstruction, renal injury, or infections. During ureteroscopy, an endoscope is inserted through the urethra to break up larger stones with lasers or ultrasound. Fragments are either retrieved or, if small, allowed to pass naturally. Unfortunately, residual fragments and dust often cause recurrent symptomatic obstruction and stone regrowth. Therefore, there is a critical need for a more efficient clearance method. In response, vacuum-assisted sheaths have been recently introduced. However, they remove renal fluid along with the debris, necessitating fluid infusion to sustain the renal pressure.\nStanford researchers at the Zhao Lab have designed a safer and more efficient kidney stone fragments and dusts extraction device that can be used together with kidney stone breaking devices. Their device is based on rotation to manipulate the flow and create a vortex that provides a localized suction towards the device to capture the stone fragments and dusts in the device. Unlike the vacuum-assisted device, this device avoids the risk of collapsing the kidney due to irregularly reduced intrarenal pressure.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept – in vitro data\n\nApplications: Kidney stone removal.\n\nAdvantages: Complete clearance of stones of varying sizes, Reduced treatment time, Reduced risk of recurrence."

Stanford University,Microbial-driven atmospheric CO2 conversion for large-scale carbon sequestration,Docket #: S23-462,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/microbial-driven-atmospheric-co2-conversion-large-scale-carbon-sequestration,"Stanford scientists have developed a method that utilizes specialized microbes to capture and convert dilute atmospheric carbon dioxide into reduced organic compounds. This innovative technology, capable of metabolizing CO2 at low, atmospheric concentrations, offers a promising approach to large-scale carbon sequestration, potentially contributing to global efforts to remove tens of gigatons of carbon dioxide annually by 2030.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is a primary contributor to global warming, with atmospheric concentrations steadily increasing due to human activities. Traditional CO2 capture methods often require energy-intensive processes to concentrate and convert the gas, and there are limited end uses for CO2, reducing incentive for CO2 capture and limiting the large-scale applicability. Biological systems, particularly CO2-respiring microbes, offer a promising alternative due to their ability to metabolize CO2 at low concentrations and ambient conditions. Unlike energy-intensive chemical processes, these commonly anaerobic microorganisms can directly capture and convert dilute CO2 into useful organic compounds, operating efficiently in moderately alkaline solutions at ambient temperatures and pressures. Understanding the mechanisms of microbial CO2 metabolism and the conditions that facilitate it could lead to the development of efficient, large-scale carbon capture and conversion technologies.\nPreliminary experiments with the microbial CO2 capture and conversion system demonstrated successful production of reduced carbon compounds from indoor air. Importantly, the system consumed CO2 to levels below average atmospheric concentrations at sea level, indicating effective carbon sequestration. These results suggest that the microbial technology is capable of both capturing and converting dilute atmospheric CO2. Consequently, this approach has the potential to significantly contribute to global carbon sequestration efforts and transform climate change mitigation strategies by offering a sustainable method to remove CO2 from the atmosphere while producing valuable organic compounds.\nStage of Development:\nProof of Concept\nContinued research – Operation of the technology in a continuous system at a larger scale.

Stanford University,Subterranean thermal energy storage system for concentrating solar power,Docket #: S10-165,"Published Application: 20130206134, Issued: 9,291,367 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/subterranean-thermal-energy-storage-system-concentrating-solar-power,"Researchers in the Stanford School of Sustainability have patented a sustainable, cost-effective, scalable subsurface energy storage system with the potential to revolutionize solar thermal energy storage by making solar energy available 24/7 for a wide range of industrial applications. Subsurface thermal energy storage addresses key challenges faced by solar thermal energy: intermittency and the need for large-scale, long-term storage. Instead of using above ground insulated tanks with exotic molten salts for energy storage, this method (see Figure 1) uses the vast pore volume of depleted oil and gas fields for heat storage, which reduces above-ground infrastructure, cuts costs, increases the amount of energy that may be stored, is scalable, and potentially reduces heat losses.  The heat is stored in the reservoir until there is a demand for energy. The energy is brought to the surface and can be used to generate electricity or process heat, making the system adaptable for different industrial applications, and potentially converting solar thermal energy to a base load renewable energy.\nFigure 1 Subsurface storage system for thermal energy (Image courtesy SUETRI-A)\nSolar collectors generate saturated steam, which is injected into underground reservoirs (ideally warmed from past thermally enhanced oil recovery (TEOR) processes, minimizing heat loss).

Without carbon utilization, however, high costs impede large scale capture efforts.  Alexander Al Zubeidi, a Stanford post doc in the D-Lab, has developed an inexpensive, scalable gas flow cell based system to convert atmospheric CO2 to other hydrocarbon based chemicals (like ethylene) using light and excess renewable electricity.\nFigure 1 – Prototype Cell Process\n(Image courtesy the D-Lab)\nIn the prototype system, gas enters the reactor cell via a gas flow channel, flows over the gas diffusion electrode covered in copper nanoparticles and electrolyte solution at ambient temperature.  Visible light (450-800 nm) enters through the cell window, exciting copper nanoparticle electrons that reduce CO2 to ethylene.  These electrolyzers can produce hydrocarbon based chemicals and syngas, a mixture of H2 and O2. Unlike competing electrolyzers that are built to operate on large scales, with long payback periods that typically require high capacity factors, the D-Lab system (Figure 2) can operate when renewable energy is in excess, generating net-zero emissions and converting point-source CO2 emissions to high-value products.  This inexpensive, scalable plasmonic gas flow reactor system provides cost effective carbon capture CO2 gas separation and storage while producing valuable feedstocks for the chemical industry or zero-carbon fuels.\nFigure 2 – Scaled Up Reactor Array \n(Image courtesy the D-Lab)\nStage of Development – Proof of Concept Prototype\n\nApplications: Industrial chemical production, especially ethylene, Green fuel / hydrocarbon based fuel production, Syngas production.\n\nAdvantages: Low cost ethylene production with high cap-ex return:  A 20 x 20 cm2 reactor operating at 80% selectivity for ethylene at 0.5 A/ cm2 operated 6 h a day can produce enough ethylene in 1 month to pay for itself., Compact, scalable and mass producible: Easy to ship and scale up using eletrolyzers in parallel to keep production and supply chain uncomplicated., No purification of reactants: The gas diffusion electrode operates with captured CO2 and gas mixtures containing CO2, which reduces upfront costs and energy consumption., Operates at ambient temperature: The electrolyzer can be started and shut down rapidly, allowing it to only operate when electricity costs are low., Does not require CH3."
Stanford University,Using deep learning to predict ankle-brachial index from Doppler sounds in diabetic patients,Docket #: S23-374,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/using-deep-learning-predict-ankle-brachial-index-doppler-sounds-diabetic-patients,"Stanford researchers have developed AutoABI, a deep learning system that predicts ankle-brachial index (ABI) from Doppler ultrasound sounds. This approach offers a new method for ABI measurements, particularly useful for patients with non-compressible arteries, such as those with diabetes. By analyzing Doppler sounds, AutoABI provides a straightforward way to assess peripheral artery disease (PAD) risk without traditional blood pressure cuffs. The system could improve the accessibility and efficiency of PAD diagnosis in point-of-care settings, where quick and accurate assessments are valuable.\nAnkle-brachial index (ABI) is a crucial diagnostic tool for peripheral artery disease (PAD), but current measurement methods face significant limitations. Traditional ABI assessment requires inflating a blood pressure cuff while using Doppler ultrasound to measure blood flow in the tibial arteries. However, this technique proves unreliable in patients with non-compressible arteries, a common condition in diabetics with PAD. These patients often have medial arterial calcification, leading to falsely elevated and unreliable ABI readings. The prevalence of diabetes and the increasing need for accurate PAD diagnosis underscores the importance of developing more versatile, point-of-care ABI measurement techniques. An improved method that can provide reliable ABI estimates without relying on blood pressure cuffs could significantly enhance PAD diagnosis and management, particularly in challenging patient populations.\nAutoABI, a deep learning system integrated into a hand-held Doppler device, successfully predicts ankle-brachial index (ABI) directly from audible Doppler sounds without the need for blood pressure cuffs. This innovative approach enables ABI measurements in patients with non-compressible arteries, a common issue in diabetics with PAD. The device's on-board computer processes Doppler signals in real-time, displaying results on an integrated touch screen for immediate clinical use. By offering a more versatile and accessible method for ABI assessment, AutoABI has the potential to significantly improve PAD diagnosis and management across various healthcare settings, from hospital wards to vascular labs.\nStage of Development:\nPrototype\nContinued research: fully integrating the computer and deep learning computation within the Doppler device itself, eliminating the need for external processing and creating a self-contained, portable ABI measurement system.\n\nApplications: Diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), Ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurements in patients with non-compressible arteries, such as diabetics, Point-of-care vascular health assessments in clinics and hospital wards, Integration into existing vascular lab equipment for enhanced capabilities.\n\nAdvantages: Eliminates the need for blood pressure cuffs in ABI measurements, Provides reliable ABI estimates for patients with calcified arteries, Increases accessibility of ABI testing in various clinical settings, Offers real-time, on-device processing and results display, Simplifies the ABI measurement process for healthcare providers, Potential for improved PAD diagnosis rates and patient outcomes."

Compared to images without spectral compounding, this invention can reduce the speckle noise by 2-3X and dramatically improve image quality, as demonstrated in preliminary data.\nFigure\nStage of Development - Proof of Concept\n\nApplications: Diagnostic Ultrasound Imaging.\n\nAdvantages: Method minimizes speckle for given spatial resolution, Improves image quality, Enables general diagnostic purposes."
Stanford University,Therapeutic targets to limit high-grade glioma spread,Docket #: S17-248,"Published Application: 20190055556, Issued: 10,550,388 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/therapeutic-targets-limit-high-grade-glioma-spread,"Researchers in Dr. Michelle Monje-Deisseroth's lab at Stanford have identified therapeutic targets for drug development to limit the spread of high-grade gliomas (HGGs). HGGs, including glioblastoma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, are a group of brain cancers with dire prognosis. They frequently invade a region of the brain called the subventricular zone (SVZ) and this spread correlates with decreased survival. Currently the only therapeutic approach to limit spreading into the SVZ is not optimal as it involves irradiation of the SVZ, which can cause very serious side effects. Thus, new targeted therapeutic strategies are needed.\nThe inventors have determined that SVZ invasion is promoted by the secretion of pleiotrophin, which forms a complex with a group of proteins that acts as a chemoattractant for the glioma to the SVZ. Therapeutic agents that inhibit this chemoattractant complex, such as inhibitory nucleic acids, thus provide a strategy for treating HGGs. This technology provides potential new targets for drug development to limit the spread of deadly brain cancers.\nFigure\n\nApplications: Drug development- new targets for development of therapeutics to treat gliomas, Inhibitory nucleic acids (shRNA, siRNA, miRNA, ASOs) to treat HGG spread.\n\nAdvantages: Unmet medical need- existing therapeutic strategy is non-optimal, Provides new targets for therapeutic development."
Stanford University,An automated tool for vascular and perivascular segmentation of brain MRI data to identify the risk of dementia and accelerated brain atrophy,Docket #: S23-532,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/automated-tool-vascular-and-perivascular-segmentation-brain-mri-data-identify-risk,"Stanford scientists have developed PVSeg, a tool that automatically segments vascular and perivascular compartments in brain MRI data. This innovative tool can identify non-demented individuals at increased risk of developing dementia and accelerated brain atrophy. PVSeg's metrics could serve as a screening tool, allowing early diagnosis of brain microvascular issues and potentially improving patient treatments and outcomes. Additionally, it could enrich clinical trials for treatments targeting cognitive decline by identifying suitable candidates at increased risk of future cognitive impairment, thereby reducing subject enrollment challenges and decreasing costs. Moreover, in clinical trials specifically targeting Alzheimer's disease pathology (amyloid-β and tau), PVSeg's metrics can refine the selection of participants with a """"purer"""" form of preclinical Alzheimer's disease by identifying and screening out individuals with radiographic signs of vascular damage, improving efficiency and effectiveness of clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. Finally, PVSeg's metrics are suitable for longitudinal assessments, allowing the evaluation of treatment effects on the brain vasculature in-vivo.\nCerebral small vessel disease is a significant contributor to cognitive decline and dementia. Currently, clinicians use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect signs of vascular damage in the brain, such as white matter hyperintensities and microbleeds. However, these markers are often subtle in healthy individuals and lack quantitative precision. Recent advancements allow for the measurement of brain vasculature and perivascular spaces using standard T1-weighted MRI scans. Yet, current techniques have notable limitations: they are user-dependent, leading to potential inconsistencies, and lack inter-scanner reproducibility. These drawbacks hinder the execution of large-scale, longitudinal studies and clinical trials crucial for understanding the relationship between vascular changes and cognitive impairment over time. There is a clear need for a more robust, automated method to quantify cerebral vascular structures consistently across different MRI machines and over extended periods.\nA novel, fully automated algorithm has been developed to assess perivascular diameter and count of blood vessels with MRI-visible perivascular space in white matter and basal ganglia using standard 3D T1-weighted MRI scans. PVSeg demonstrates excellent inter-scanner and test-retest reproducibility, addressing key limitations of current methods. Importantly, the algorithm revealed significant associations between vascular metrics and dementia risk, as well as brain atrophy rates, in a large-scale study (>10,000 subjects). By enabling more efficient screening in clinical trials, PVSeg has the potential to substantially reduce required participant numbers and to refine their selection, thereby increasing trial power and reducing costs in dementia research.\nStage of Development:\n\nApplications: Assessment of cerebral small vessel disease and its relation to cognitive decline, Early detection of individuals at high risk for dementia, Enrichment of clinical trials for cognitive impairment and dementia, Evaluation of treatment effects on brain vasculature in-vivo.\n\nAdvantages: Fully automated segmentation of vascular and perivascular compartments in brain MRI, Excellent inter-scanner reproducibility and test-retest repeatability, Robust performance in longitudinal studies, Requires only standard T1-weighted MRI sequences, enabling widespread use, Potential for significant cost reduction in clinical trials through improved participant selection."
Stanford University,Electronic Lateral Flow Assay Rapidly Detects and Quantifies Multiple Compounds Wirelessly,Docket #: S24-301,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/electronic-lateral-flow-assay-rapidly-detects-and-quantifies-multiple-compounds,"Stanford researchers have developed a electrochemical lateral flow assay (eLFA) diagnostics platform that eliminates the instrumentation typically needed to analyze or read point of use tests.\nPoint of use tests are commonly conducted under scenarios where resources are scarce. They are utilized in order to rapidly detect and quantify multiple compounds of interest in biological, chemical and environmental samples. However, instrumentation cost, size and power requirements can severely limit utilization of point of use tests in resource-limited settings. Elimination of the instrumentation typically required to analyze or read point of use tests would enable modern diagnostics technologies to be employed more widely. This would provide users with real-time, actionable health and/or environmental information.\nTherefore to address the limitation of instrumentation, Stanford researchers developed a electrochemical lateral flow assay diagnostics platform that eliminates the need for expensive analyzers or reader instrumentation typically required for quantitative tests. Instead the eLFA communicates the presence or abundance of compounds of interest to a user wirelessly via a cell phone app. This advanced eLFA technology platform presents commercial opportunities as it is compatible with the two most widely utilized molecular diagnostics test formats, sandwich assays and competition assays.\nStage of development\nPrototype\n\nApplications: Tests that can identify and wirelessly communicate the presence or abundance of:\n\nInfectious disease antigens or antibodies in biological samples\nHuman and veterinary health and wellness biomarkers in biological samples and/or chemical irritants or toxins in environmental samples\nAdulterants or impurities in foods, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, Infectious disease antigens or antibodies in biological samples, Human and veterinary health and wellness biomarkers in biological samples and/or chemical irritants or toxins in environmental samples, Adulterants or impurities in foods, chemicals and pharmaceuticals.\n\nAdvantages: Accurate and low-cost, Eliminates the need of traditional test reader instrumentation., Capability to measure multiple biomarkers simultaneously, Powered wirelessly."
Stanford University,Additive manufacturing of iron components for magnetic shielding,Docket #: S24-193,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/additive-manufacturing-iron-components-magnetic-shielding,"Researchers in the Gu Research Group and SUPER lab have developed an additive manufacturing method for making iron-based magnetic shielding coatings and components by controlling the geometry of the iron, leading to significantly better performance.  Magnetic shielding protects vulnerable devices used in automotives, aerospace and aviation, telecommunications, data storage, medical imaging equipment, high precision instruments, and more.  Permeability, magnetic saturation, thermal stability, and operating frequency range determine magnetic shield effectiveness. Iron has excellent magnetic saturation and thermal stability, but can only be used in the frequency range of 100 Hz due to eddy current losses. Fe-Si and other soft metal alloys are typically used, which are expensive and difficult to process.\nThe Stanford researchers' additive manufacturing (AM) method leverages space-filling curves to increase the iron components frequency range three orders of magnitude to above 1 kHz, without affecting iron's saturation, permeability, or thermal stability.  The process is easier, faster, and less expensive than industry standards, and resulting prototypes meet or outperform industry standard devices made from more resistive nanocrystalline and amorphous compositions, and laminate devices made from electrical steel. (See graph)  In addition, the AM shield shape can conform closely to the shape of the component it is shielding, and other high-saturation and high temperature shielding materials may be used, such as FeNi and FeCo alloys.\nStage of Development – Proof of Concept\nTopology optimization is ongoing for iron, other magnetic metallic alloys (FeNi and FeCo), and amorphous metals to increase their cut-off frequency to the MHz regime to compete with ferrites and Iron/Polymer composites.\nAdditively manufactured, space-filling curve prototype Hilbert structures with an inset of the CAD model including a comparison of the order 4 and order 5 cross-sections.\n(Image Courtesy the Gu Group and SUPER Lab)\nBenchmark comparison of topology optimized additively manufactured components (o4, o5) vs. solid and laminated components\n(Image Courtesy the Gu Group and SUPER Lab)\n\nApplications: Custom magnetic shielding for:, Medical Devices and Medical Imaging Equipment, Electronics and Magnetic Storage Media, High-Precision Instruments (e.g. electron microscopes, etc), Automotive, Aerospace and Aviation, Telecommunications.\n\nAdvantages: Faster, easier processing at lower cost  - No need for complex stacking laminations.

Stanford University,Baseband Quantum Networks for Superconducting Circuits,Docket #: S23-088,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/baseband-quantum-networks-superconducting-circuits,"Stanford researchers have developed an approach to enable larger superconducting quantum systems that can likely span several refrigerators, necessitating connecting qubits across refrigerators efficiently. Current connectors are limited in its scalability.\nSuperconducting coaxial cables have not been seriously considered for connecting qubits in neighboring dilution refrigerators because they lose quantum information too quickly at typical superconducting qubit frequencies (approximately 2-8 GHz). However, it is known that such cables are extremely low loss at low frequencies when the wavelength of light is comparable to the fridge-to-fridge separation. This invention enables qubits to be strongly coupled to the low-frequency modes of superconducting coaxial cables using a circuit that transduces quantum information from typical qubit frequencies down to a lower frequency, the so-called baseband, where the tradeoff between frequency-dependent loss and thermal fluctuations is optimized.\nStage of Development\n\nApplications: Quantum computing data centers,  where computational tasks can be distributed over superconducting quantum processors in different dilution refrigerators, End user will be researchers and industry  seeking to run larger quantum simulations or solve larger optimization problems not currently possible with current computation capabilities.\n\nAdvantages: Scalable, Improves the accuracy and capacity of the quantum channel,   especially using frequencies around 200 MHz instead of 8 GHz, Enables many hundreds of times increase in transmission rates,  especially in contrast to other approaches, i.e. using optical photons, or microwave photons through waveguides."
Stanford University,Ultrasound Heat Therapy Device for Preventing Perineal Tears During Labor and Delivery,Docket #: S23-250,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/ultrasound-heat-therapy-device-preventing-perineal-tears-during-labor-and-delivery,"Of the 1.4 million first time mothers giving vaginal birth in the United States, approximately 75% will experience tearing of their vagina or perineum. During labor, the pelvic floor stretches to accommodate fetal passage, and overstretching of this relatively inelastic tissue can result in tearing and permanent injury. Up to 7% of mothers will experience the most severe form of tears, where the laceration extends from the vaginal opening all the way to the anus and rectum, damaging the underlying tissues. These severe injuries require comprehensive repair, and put patients at increased risk of post-partum complications such as infections, wound dehiscence, and pain. Patients with severe tears are also more likely to experience long term sequelae of their injuries including incontinence, prolapse, and dyspareunia. These result in ongoing follow-up visits, out of pocket costs, and in some cases additional surgical procedures. The prevention of perineal trauma during childbirth remains a significant concern for maternal health.\nEvidence suggests that applying heat to the perineal area can potentially reduce the risk of trauma by increasing tissue elasticity and blood flow. However, current methods for delivering this heat, such as conductive heating pads or compresses, present challenges in achieving safe and effective temperatures. Conductive heat can easily lead to burns, especially in the sensitive perineal region of patients that are often under anesthesia. Most available equipment is not designed to provide the consistent, controlled heat necessary to induce beneficial changes at the tissue level. The development of an ultrasound-based heating device specifically for the perineum offers a promising solution to these challenges. By using ultrasound technology, heat can be applied more precisely and safely, reducing the risk of burns while delivering the optimal temperature needed to increase tissue elasticity and potentially lower the risk of perineal tears. This approach combines both safety and effectiveness, addressing the usability gaps in current heating methods and providing a novel intervention for childbirth-related perineal trauma prevention.\nInventors at Stanford have developed a handheld therapeutic device that uses ultrasound energy to heat the tissues of the perineum. The device consists of a reusable ultrasound unit with a single use disposable gel pad which will be exchanged between patients and can be easily replaced if soiled. The energy from the device improves pelvic floor elasticity by 1) changing the viscoelastic properties of the underlying tissue at a precisely controlled depth, 2) stimulating blood flow to improve tissue's resistance to tearing, and 3) inhibiting neural pathways that lead to over-contraction of the pelvic muscles during the delivery. The device provides a low-cost therapeutic solution that ensures sterility, patient comfort, and ease of use at the bedside.\nStage of Development\nProof of Concept - The device is at the proof-of-concept stage. Existing literature supports the efficacy of heat in reducing perineal trauma, and we have successfully demonstrated that our ultrasound technology can safely heat tissues at the required depth without causing burns. This establishes a strong foundation for the device's potential in preventing perineal tears during childbirth. Further development is focused on optimizing the device for clinical use.\n\nApplications: Perineal trauma, Maternal health, OB/GYN, Labor and Delivery, Medical device, Therapeutic ultrasound.\n\nAdvantages: No existing commercial solutions aimed at reducing perineal tears during delivery, Precise control of heat delivery: precision targeting and controlled temperature that ensures an optimal temperature at deeper tissues without overheating the skin, Non-invasive and safe, Portable and user-friendly design."
Stanford University,Using gene therapy and metabolite supplementation to treat ciliopathies,Docket #: S23-278,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/using-gene-therapy-and-metabolite-supplementation-treat-ciliopathies,"Stanford scientists have discovered that novel gene therapy and metabolite supplementation approaches show promise in treating ciliopathies. These potential breakthroughs could significantly impact patients, as there are currently no approved treatments for any ciliopathy condition.\nCiliopathies are genetic disorders affecting multiple organ systems and reducing life expectancy. Joubert syndrome, a rare form of ciliopathy, is characterized by midbrain defects, ocular motor apraxia, and developmental delays. At least 35 genes critical for cilia function have been identified in these disorders. Ciliopathies can lead to renal failure, progressive blindness, and other severe complications. Despite the identification of key genes like ARMC9 and the significant impact on patients' quality of life, there are currently no approved treatments for any ciliopathy condition, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches.\nGene therapy and metabolite supplementation resulted in a rescue of cilia formation in Joubert Syndrome patient cells. Importantly, these treatments rescued cellular defects and cilia deficiency in vivo and in cellular models. Consequently, gene therapy and metabolite supplementation have the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and transform the treatment landscape for ciliopathies by addressing the fundamental cellular and molecular defects underlying these disorders.\nStage of Development\nPreclinical - in vivo\nContinued research - continuing with future applications for NIH funding\n\nApplications: Treatment of ciliopathies, including Joubert Syndrome, Addressing cellular defects and cilia formation in genetic disorders, Potential therapy for multiple organ systems affected by ciliopathies.\n\nAdvantages: Gene therapy rescues cilia formation in Joubert Syndrome patients, Metabolite supplementation restores cellular defects and cilia deficiency in vivo and in cells, Versatile approaches that can potentially address multiple ciliopathy manifestations."
Stanford University,Using exosomes as biomarkers for non-invasive brain tumor detection,Docket #: S23-327,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/using-exosomes-biomarkers-non-invasive-brain-tumor-detection,"Stanford scientists have developed a device to distinguish the molecule-specific signatures of diseased exosomes isolated from glioblastoma patients. The device is portable, disposable, and low-cost, enabling point-of-care assessment of disease. Classifying exosomes from patient plasma can be used as a diagnostic for rapid, sensitive, and non-invasive diagnoses of brain cancers.\nGlioblastoma detection poses significant challenges due to its complex nature and similarity to other brain lesions. Current diagnostic methods, primarily relying on MRI and biopsy, are limited in their ability to accurately distinguish glioblastoma from other conditions or detect early recurrence. The heterogeneity of glioblastoma further complicates diagnosis, requiring extensive molecular and histopathological analysis as per WHO guidelines. These methods are often costly, time-consuming, and not universally accessible. With a median survival of less than 15 months and a 90% recurrence rate, there is an urgent need for more efficient and accurate detection methods. Developing a rapid, cost-effective, and non-invasive screening tool could substantially enhance glioblastoma diagnosis, enabling earlier detection, more precise tumor margin identification, and improved differentiation from treatment-related changes. Consequently, a molecule-specific non-invasive tool that can provide comprehensive diagnostic information is essential to address these clinical challenges and improve patient outcomes.\nUsing Surface Enhanced Raman spectroscopy (Glio-SERS) and machine learning to classify exosomes resulted in high specificity and sensitivity in glioblastoma identification. Importantly, Glio-SERS is capable of differentiating between glioblastoma and other brain lesions with high accuracy. Consequently, Glio-SERS has the potential to drastically improve glioblastoma detection and transform the brain cancer field by providing a rapid, sensitive, and non-invasive diagnostic for glioblastoma patients.\nFigure:\nFigure description: A schematic showcasing the diagnostic device\nStage of Development:\nProof of Concept\n\nApplications: Detection of glioblastoma and other brain tumors, Diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and brain cancers, Creation of a spectral library of exosome molecular signatures, Distinguishing healthy vs brain tumor patients from plasma exosomes, Distinguishing different brain tumors from each other.\n\nAdvantages: Non-invasive due to the use of patient plasma samples, High sensitivity and specificity even when differentiating similar neurological diseases, The device is portable which allows point-of-care diagnosis, Rapid turnaround time in diagnostic procedures, Can assist physicians for deciding on whether further clinical tests required (MRI, biopsy, surgical removal of the tumor), and help reducing the unnecessary imaging/invasive surgical procedures, Can detect tumor recurrence from post-surgical tissue changes that existing imaging techniques might fall short of, eliminating unnecessary imaging/invasice surgical procedures."
Stanford University,ePay / Stanford CardinalPay Platform for Managing Merchant Accounts in Complex Organizations,Docket #: S24-158,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/epay-stanford-cardinalpay-platform-managing-merchant-accounts-complex-organizations,"This technology developed at Stanford is a software platform for administering Stripe merchant accounts shared across large, complex organizations. Payment collection via a service like Stripe when many accounts are used within a large organization or when one account is shared across a complex organization can become difficult to manage. This software was created as an all-in-one solution to allow the Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) group to manage Stripe usage across 1000+ groups and multiple unique use cases and has proven effective in managing day-to-day merchant operations for these groups.

Stanford University,"Noninvasive, ultrasonic cerebrospinal fluid clearance to treat brain injuries",Docket #: S24-235,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/noninvasive-ultrasonic-cerebrospinal-fluid-clearance-treat-brain-injuries,"Researchers in the Airan Lab have developed a noninvasive method using low intensity transcranial ultrasound to drive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glymphatic and lymphatic flow to clear brain injury waste products from CSF and brain interstitium.  Unlike other approaches, this method is nonpharmacologic; free of exogenous agents such as nanoparticles or microbubbles; requires no sensory stimulation nor a specific neural activity pattern; and can be applied when the patient is awake, asleep, or semi-conscious.  In mouse models, the ultrasonic CSF clearance (UCC) treatment reduced neuroinflammatory and neuro cytotoxic profiles, improved behavioral outcomes, and increased acute brain injury survival.   Effective, noninvasive and versatile, the UCC treatment could be a pivotal tool in treating  hemorrhagic, ischemic or traumatic brain injury; migraines; neurodegeneration; intracranial hypertension, normal pressure hydrocephalus; and other chronic brain diseases.\nStage of Development: Proof of Concept\nUnder funding from Corundum Neurosciences and the Focused Ultrasound Foundation, the Airan Lab is actively designing a prototype device to facilitate UCC treatment protocol in a human trial.\n\nApplications: Transcranial focused ultrasound treatments for:, Hemorrhagic, ischemic, traumatic, and tumor-induced brain injuries, Edema, intracranial hypertension, hydrocephalus, and intracranial pressure elevation, Autoimmune or infectious encephalitis, Migraines, headaches, and concussion, Epilepsy, sleep and circadian rhythm disorders, and other chronic brain diseases.\n\nAdvantages: Noninvasive and nonintrusive - can be applied in the awake, asleep, or obtunded patient, Nonpharmacologic, free of pharmacologic side effects, and free of exogenous agents (e.g. nanoparticles, microbubbles, etc.), Effective - reduces neuroinflammatory and neuro cytotoxic profiles, improves behavioral outcomes, decreases morbidity and, increases survival for acute brain injury, Broadly applicable to treat various brain diseases."
Stanford University,Predictive Biomarker for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Recurrence,Docket #: S24-299,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/predictive-biomarker-hepatocellular-carcinoma-hcc-recurrence,"Stanford researchers have developed a predictive biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence post-treatment that provides key spatial distribution information about cell interaction.\nHepatocellular carcinoma is the most common form of liver cancer and has poor five-year survival rates of below 20%. Early-stage HCC patients often undergo surgery to remove damaged livers as a means of disease intervention. However, the effectiveness of surgery is often counteracted by high recurrence rates, which can range from 50-70%. To reduce high recurrence, adjuvant therapies can be used in the clinic, yet these therapies cause severe adverse events in more than a third of the patients.\nOne of the primary challenges of combating early recurrence is identifying reliable biomarkers to help predict patients who are most likely to experience HCC recurrence after treatments like surgery or chemoembolization. Prior biomarkers for HCC, such as gene signatures or protein expression, are limited in their ability to provide information about the spatial distribution of cells or how cancer and immune cells interact with each other.\nTo address this gap Stanford researchers developed a novel spatial signature/ biomarker capable of identifying patients at high risk of recurrence with high accuracy. This predictive capability could enhance patient outcomes by making more informed selection of patients for risky adjuvant therapies, as well as enabling more tailored post-operative treatment plans. The technology is also designed to work with standard histology samples, making it easily integrable into current clinical and commercial workflows without the need for specialized equipment or processes.\nStage of research\nIn vivo data\n\nApplications: Predictive diagnostic tool for liver cancer, Identifying patients who need adjuvant therapy, Personalized medicine & patient management (aid more effective post-surgical treatment decisions), Monitoring and managing HCC recurrence.\n\nAdvantages: Incorporates complex spatial contexts of cellular interactions., More accurate prediction of disease progression., Easily integrable into current clinical workflows.."
Stanford University,A general method for large-scale alignment of cellular and molecular properties measured in live beings and postmortem on the same biological sample,Docket #: S23-533,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/general-method-large-scale-alignment-cellular-and-molecular-properties-measured-live,"Typically, cell live imaging and cell molecular profiling are performed on two different samples without the direct observation of two modalities of information on the exact same cells. The main challenge lies in tissue distortions and loss of spatial information during sample processing, such as slicing or chemical treatments.\nStanford researchers have developed a solution to track the spatial coordinates of the sample throughout the process. By maintaining a coordinated reference system and correcting for distortions, the method allows researchers to map molecular profiles back to the same cells that were observed in vivo. This approach offers a new level of precision in studying organs like the brain, liver, or kidney, where understanding both cellular function and molecular properties is critical.\nStage of Development \nIn vivo: studies in neurons in the mouse brain\n\nApplications: Aligning of in vivo cell imaging and ex vivo structural molecular profiling of the same cells, Research in:  Neuroscience, cancer, clinical diagnostics, drug development, immunotherapy.\n\nAdvantages: Large-scale alignment, Precise, Economical, Reliable, Only such method in the market."
Stanford University,Deep Learning Enabled Hybrid CT-MRI with Highly Sparse Sensory Data,Docket #: S21-073,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/deep-learning-enabled-hybrid-ct-mri-highly-sparse-sensory-data,"Among the many medical imaging modalities, CT and MRI scans are utilized most often for imaging bone and soft tissue respectively. As such, physicians often require both images to fully diagnose patients and determine treatment plans. To better harness these advantages, this work has developed a deep-learning model for creating hybrid CT-MRI images from highly sparse sensory data. The key component of this technology utilizes the assumption that each hybrid, CT, and MRI image can be reconstructed from a shared latent feature space. Therefore, the training set only requires a mini-batch of CT and MRI images each which is fed into the cross-modal auto encoder framework. Preliminary testing has shown that analytic reconstruction of just the CT or MRI images show large streak artifacts due to under-sampled data, but the hybrid image has high similarity with the true images. The degree of fusion between CT and MRI can also be tuned using a fusion hyperparameter allowing physicians to create the most useful image.\nStage of Research\n\nApplications: Treatment planning for radiation therapy, Hybrid image guided interventions (e.g., radiation therapy or surgery), Effectively fuse different modality images: low-dose CT and fast MRI reconstruction.\n\nAdvantages: Higher image quality for improved diagnostics and image guidance: hybrid images preserve high bone contrast and clear soft tissue dynamic range, Creation of MRI image from CT sensory data, and vice vera., Reduced human intervention in regularization term design."
Stanford University,Novel small molecule negative allosteric modulators of the mu-opioid receptor,Docket #: S23-339,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/novel-small-molecule-negative-allosteric-modulators-mu-opioid-receptor,"Researchers at Stanford University and Washington University in St. Louis have discovered a novel molecular pathway for the treatment of opioid overdose.\nOpioids are a powerful tool for pain management when used in clinical care settings. However, in recent years these drugs have been misappropriated for recreational use, spurring a public health crisis. In the US alone there were over 80,000 deaths due to opioid overdose in 2022. Naloxone has proven to be a key tool in the fight against opioid overdose by acting as an agonist of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). However, use of naloxone for opioid overdose has drawbacks, including that naloxone requires larger, repeated doses in response to more potent fentanyl. To this end, a need exists for novel negative allosteric modulators of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) that are selective with limited off target effects.\nStage of Development\nResearch - in vitro\nStage of Research\nResearchers sought to improve upon their previous finding (compound 368) via structure-based optimization in order to find compounds with enhanced medicinal chemistry properties. Specifically, researchers modified a potentially labile sulfide to an ether to improve its pharmacokinetic properties.  Researchers found that this compound is an allosteric modulator of the MOR in vitro. While this molecule is still a full inhibitor of the MOR, it has a dampened ability to enhance naloxone affinity for the receptor, which in turn makes the molecule less dependent on co-administration with naloxone for activity.\n\nApplications: Novel treatment of opioid overdose.\n\nAdvantages: Potentially less dependent on co-administration with naloxone for therapeutic effects."
Stanford University,Design of Universal H5 Influenza virus vaccine candidates via Antigen Reorientation,Docket #: S24-068,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/design-universal-h5-influenza-virus-vaccine-candidates-antigen-reorientation,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed novel universal vaccine candidates for H5 influenza viruses.\nInfluenza remains a serious threat to public health. H5 avian influenza strains are among the most concerning despite lack of documented human to human transmission due to their high mortality rates (40-60%). Currently available vaccines are unlikely to confer significant immunity to H5. Additionally, a large portion of public health resources every year are expended to create a seasonal vaccine for influenza viral strains that are circulating in the general population. Taken together, these facts point towards the urgent unmet need for a universal influenza vaccine.\nStage of Development\nResearch - in vivo\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have created novel vaccine candidates for H5 influenza viruses. Specifically, the immune response to these vaccine candidates is directed towards specific epitopes that are conserved across strains and are less mutable than epitopes that are traditionally exposed. A modified H5 HA antigen is presented in a defined orientation via electrostatic interactions with the adjuvant such that specific epitopes are exposed and the immune response is therefore directed towards those exposed epitopes.\nThis in turn will confer immunity to a larger breadth of viral variants. Experiments in mice with these vaccine candidates have shown that these vaccine candidates generate broad immunity to a number of influenza strains.\n\nApplications: Vaccine candidates for H5 avian influeza, Vaccine candidates for a breadth of influenza viruses.\n\nAdvantages: Generates broad immunity to a number of influenza viral strains via exposure of a conserved epitope."
Stanford University,Selective sensitization of cancer cells to elimination by cytotoxic lymphocytes,Docket #: S24-186,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/selective-sensitization-cancer-cells-elimination-cytotoxic-lymphocytes,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed a novel method for the treatment and prevention of cancer.\nThe immune system is an integral part of the human body's response to outside threats, including cancer. Specifically, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells have been shown to selectively seek and eliminate cancer cells. However, cancer cells have evolved several ways to evade this immune response, including downregulating receptors, altering tumor associated antigens, and changing the tumor microenvironment. High throughput genetic knockdown and knockout screens have been highly effective in identifying key genetic drivers of these mechanisms. However, these screens are most likely to identify factors that are necessary but not sufficient for a response. A need exists for new methods in identifying and isolating novel regulators of the cancer immune interface.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a method by which cancer cells are able to be specifically sensitized to enhance their elimination by cytotoxic lymphocytes. Specifically, the inventors performed a screen to identify factors which make cancer cells more susceptible to killing by CD8+ T cells. These targets were then overexpressed, individually or in combination, in cancer cells in order to sensitize them to cytotoxic lymphocyte killing. Targets for this sensitization also include ligands that can act in a paracrine signalling mechanism to induce cytotoxic killing activity in engineered lymphocytes. Taken together, this invention comprises a promising therapeutic avenue for the treatment and prevention of cancer.\nStage of Development\nResearch - in vitro\n\nApplications: Production of sensitized cancer cells and engineered cytotoxic lymphocytes, Novel therapeutic avenue for the treatment and/or prevention of cancer.\n\nAdvantages: Targets are more likely to be necessary and sufficient to produce significant anti-cancer effects."
Stanford University,Compositions and methods for re-activation of dysfunctional skeletal stem cells,Docket #: S24-195,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/compositions-and-methods-re-activation-dysfunctional-skeletal-stem-cells,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed a novel therapeutic avenue for the treatment of osteoporosis and other musculoskeletal diseases.\nMusculoskeletal disease incidence rates have increased in recent years in response to an aging population. Available therapies for osteoporosis-related bone loss are effective but come with significant side effects. As such, there is a need for novel therapeutic approaches with minimal side effects profiles. In a separate vein, stem cell technologies represent a new frontier in modern medicine. Indeed, human skeletal stem cell (hSSC) dysfunction has been implicated in musculoskeletal diseases, specifically in the context of aging. There remains a major unmet medical need for therapies targeting the re-activation of dysfunctional hSSCs in the context of musculoskeletal diseases.\nStage of Development\nResearch - in vivo\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have pioneered a novel method for re-activating dysfunctional hSSCs in the context of disease or age related dysfuntion. These researchers found that aged SSCs have lower bone-forming potential due to their a lack of diversity via their skewed lineage trajectory towards fibrostromal tissues.\nUsing a Boolean mathematics approach, they identified two factors that can re-instate youthful SSC activity in dysfunctional diseased or aged SSCs. Specifically, this method involves contacting stem cells with a combination of an inhibitor of bone morphogenic protein (BMP)/transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B) and an activator of Hedgehog (Hh) signalling. Indeed, co-administration of such factors was shown to increase osteogenesis in mice.\n\nApplications: Regeneration of bone due to aging and or disease.\n\nAdvantages: Has the potential to offer a more limited side effect profile than currently available therapies, Can be delivered using biodegradable hydrogels."
Stanford University,Photon spin processor for on-chip classical and quantum information systems,Docket #: S24-212,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/photon-spin-processor-chip-classical-and-quantum-information-systems,"Researchers in the Dionne lab (D-Lab) at Stanford University have designed an on-chip, optical spin processor for classical and quantum information systems.  The D-Lab chip-size spin processor efficiently generates one-handed circular polarized light regardless of excitation sources (e.g. light or electrical excitation), and detects both the circular polarization state and intensity of an incoming light at the same time.\nFigure 1 Photon Spin Processor for On-Chip Classical and Quantum Information Systems\n(Image courtesy the D-Lab)\nThe integrated nanophotonic platform (figure 1) includes a high-quality-factor (high-Q) chiral Si metasurface integrated with a light-emitting or absorbing thin-film.

To demonstrate the photon spin processor for classical and quantum light sources, the D-Lab integrated the Si metasurface with a monolayer crystal MoSe2, transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) film. The resulting processor, free of bulky birefringent crystals, can generate valley-selective emission at room temperature with a user-defined chirality. Importantly, the light emitter can be photoexcited or electrically excited.  Compact chiral light generation for both classical and quantum systems can greatly improve multiplexing of data streams, increase speeds, lower latency, and increase data volume.\nStage of Development – Proof of Concept Prototype\nOngoing development includes expanding the number of spin processor pixels per chip, integrating the spin processor chip with an electrical circuit board, and packaging a prototype electro-optic device.\n\nApplications: Quantum computing:, Chiral quantum light sources for increased encoding capacity and multiplex operations, On-chip sensors within photonic ICs for quantum states initialization, manipulation, and readout, Ultracompact classical chiral light sources and 2D sensors for:, Chiral sensing and circular dichroism spectroscopy, Enantiomers separation crucial to pharmaceuticals development and manufacturing, Photodynamic therapy and optogenetics, Optics-free chiral light detector to simultaneously measure circular polarization state and intensity (without birefringent crystals or photodiodes).\n\nAdvantages: High performance, Multiplexing capability -  A single chip (1 cm2) can encompass over 4000 processors (or pixels) with uniform or different functionalities, High spin selectivity -  Integrated with a light-emitting or absorbing thin film, the metasurface reaches nearly 100% selectivity of one-handed circular polarization over the other, High spectral resolution, CMOS compatible fabrication, Highly compatible with transparent conducting films (e.g. indium tin oxide and graphene)., Scalable production – Competing chiral TiO2 metasurfaces require precise control of TiO2 slant etch angle, Robust  – Competing technologies like chiral perovskite thin films degrade, Readily integrable with standard electro-optic device architectures, with no need for a camera for chiral imaging."

Laborious, costly, and subject to substantial variability, radiation therapy (RT) treatment planning requires precise imaging, target identification, dose calculation, and optimization by human planners often using trial and error to balance conflicting objectives.  Deep learning and reinforcement learning methods require large, diverse datasets and effective reward functions.\nGPT-RadPlan uses multi-modal large language models, such as GPT-4Vision (GPT-4V) from OpenAI, to leverage prior radiation oncology knowledge and incorporate additional knowledge and clinic-specific preference (via in-context learning prompt) in a fully automated treatment planning framework where the user need not train the model.\nGPT-RadPlan has three modules:\nWhen integrated into Stanford Medicine's in-house treatment planning system, GPT-RadPlan either outperformed or matched clinical plans, demonstrating superior target coverage and organ-at-risk sparing.

Current gold standards for identifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), in patient sputum samples are lengthy processes that depend on method and technician quality.  As such, there is a need to improve the diagnostics accuracy, simplicty and specificity for TB.  Stanford researchers have developed an environment-sensitive probe (DMN-Tre) for fast and accurate detection of mycobacteria. DMN-Tre is a solvatochromic trehalose conjugate that undergoes dramatic fluorescence enhancement when incorporated into mycobacterial cell wall. As a result, this probe enables the rapid, no-wash visualization of a panel of mycobacterial and corynebacterial species without nonspecific labeling of gram-positive or –negative bacteria. Additionally, DMN-Tre selects for live organisms and is able to detect Mtb in sputum sample from TB patient. Thus, DMN-Tre has a wide range of applications in microbiology research and medicine.\n\nFigure\n\nApplications: Allows for trehalose glycolipid biosynthesis imaging studies., Can be used as a viability assay reagent in research., Detects live M. tuberculosis in TB patient sample., Can be used to monitor M. tuberculosis viability in TB patient during the course of treatment..\n\nAdvantages: Simple, accurate and specific for mycobacteria and corynebacteria - can visualize Mtb in patient's sputum with no wash steps, Low cost, Easy to use - no additional extensive training required, Little to no background fluorescence from unincorporated probe."
Stanford University,Managing cancer-promoted atherosclerosis through gene regulation,Docket #: S23-525,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/managing-cancer-promoted-atherosclerosis-through-gene-regulation,"Stanford researchers have discovered that tumors increase the risk of atherosclerosis by regulating expression of a specific gene that stimulates angiogenesis and intraplaque neovessel formation.\nPrevious studies have shown that cancer patients have a significantly higher risk of developing atherosclerosis than those without cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this increased risk have not yet been identified. Understanding the cancer processes that influence atherosclerosis is crucial for developing therapies to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disorders in cancer patients and survivors.\nResearchers from the Leeper Lab at Stanford University have identified a specific gene in aortic endothelial cells that is responsible for tumor-promoted atherosclerosis. By comparing mRNA expression levels in the aortic arches of mice with and without tumors, they found that this gene is upregulated in the presence of tumors. The tumor-promoted upregulation was also confirmed in cultured human aortic endothelial cells. The increased expression of this gene triggers angiogenesis and intraplaque neovessel formation, contributing to heightened atherogenesis and plaque vulnerability. An effective dose of an agent that inhibits this gene could stabilize, prevent, or reduce atherosclerotic plaque formation in cancer patients.\nStage of Development\nIn vivo animal data, in vitro human cell data\n\nApplications: RNA silencing products, Neutralizing antibodies, Gene modification products.\n\nAdvantages: No competing technologies and products targeting tumor-promoted atherosclerosis."
Stanford University,"Reproducible, scalable in situ manufacturing method for quantum moiré interfaces",Docket #: S24-221,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/reproducible-scalable-situ-manufacturing-method-quantum-moire-interfaces,"Stanford researcher Professor Fang Liu and her student, Greg Zaborski Jr., have developed a more uniform, reproducible, efficient fabrication method for moiré structures in 2d materials that produces structures with cleaner interfaces, near perfect yield, and mass production compatible sizing (centimeter size vs current micron size).\nCreated via precise stacking or 'relative twist' of van der Waals (vdW) layers, moiré superlattices exhibit unpredicted and unexpected emergent electronics states, including superconductivity, making them attractive for a wide range of applications such as quantum devices, sensors, superconductors, ferroelectric memory, spintronic devices, and metamaterials.  The most common preparation method (tear-and-stack of Scotch tape exfoliated monolayers) is inefficient, unreproducible, and suffers twist angle inhomogeneity, interfacial contamination, micrometer sizes, and a tendency to untwist at elevated temperatures.\nThe Fang Liu Group fabrication method (see Figure 1) produces moiré superlattices from a wide range of 2D materials with unprecedented uniformity and versatility, achieving much higher throughput and near-unity yield over centimeter-scale macroscopic areas, representing a significant improvement compared to conventional techniques.  The target twist angle in homo twisted moiré structures can be precisely controlled (either manually or through automated processes), due to the perfect lattice alignment of the exfoliated monolayer within the original van der Waals layered crystal. Furthermore, the macroscopic dimension enhances thermal stability of the small twist angle structures, preventing untwisting under high-temperature processes that are essential for device fabrications.\nStage of development - Prototype\nFigure 1 Quantum moiré interfaces manufacturing method\n(Image courtesy the Fang Liu Group)\n(a) Clean gold surface templated-stripped from a plasma-cleaned silicon substrate.

Stanford University,Use of an antimicrobial cationic biopolymer for UTI and sepsis prevention in kidney stone surgery,Docket #: S23-399,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/use-antimicrobial-cationic-biopolymer-uti-and-sepsis-prevention-kidney-stone-surgery,"Stanford scientists have discovered that treating colonized kidney stones with a cationic biopolymer effectively disrupts bacterial biofilms and reduces bacterial burden while remaining biocompatible with kidney tissue. Irrigating the kidney with this cationic biopolymer during surgery could serve as a novel method to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and sepsis in kidney stone procedures.\nKidney stones are an increasingly prevalent urological disorder, often causing significant pain and requiring surgical intervention. Pathogenic bacteria are present in up to 40% of stones and can form biofilms which protect them from antibiotic treatments. As a result, stone surgeries can inadvertently disperse bacterial biofilms across the urinary tract and cause up to 30% of patients to develop a UTI and 15% to develop sepsis. Despite these known complications, little effort has been made to address this clinical issue. The standard clinical practice involves urine tests for infection followed by antibiotic treatment if the culture is positive. However, urine culture positivity rates are low compared to pelvic and stone culture positivity rates and intravenous antimicrobial therapies do not lower the risk of postoperative UTIs. Therefore, a new method of UTI and sepsis prevention during kidney stone procedures is needed.\nA cationic biopolymer has been demonstrated to interact with negatively charged bacterial surfaces, disrupting their membranes and inducing cell death through the leakage of intracellular components. Furthermore, the biopolymer disrupts bacterial biofilms, thereby reducing their resilience to antibiotic treatments. And, in the urinary tract, the biopolymer interacts with the urothelium, inducing exfoliation that expels and facilitates the eradication of highly resistant intracellular bacterial reservoirs. Treatment of colonized patient kidney stones with the biopolymer resulted in a greater than 90% bacterial viability decrease after 90 minutes. Importantly, histological analysis of human urothelium did not show any abnormalities or cytotoxic effects after treatment with the biopolymer. Therefore, the inclusion of this cationic biopolymer in saline irrigation methods during kidney surgeries can be an impactful preventative measure to decrease UTIs and sepsis in kidney stone patients.\nStage of Development:\nPreclinical – in-vivo\nContinued research – Large animal studies\n\nApplications: Antimicrobial irrigation during kidney stone surgery, Antimicrobial irrigation during endourological procedures, Prevention of UTI and sepsis.\n\nAdvantages: Currently, there are no known intravesical therapies that have broad range antimicrobial and exfoliative effects., Improves antimicrobial treatment independently of bacterial strain, biofilm biomass intensity and antibiotic resistance pattern., Biocompatible with human urinary tract tissue."
Stanford University,Small molecule inhibition of the PTER/N-acetyltaurine pathway to treat obesity,Docket #: S24-233,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/small-molecule-inhibition-ptern-acetyltaurine-pathway-treat-obesity,"Stanford scientists have discovered a series of compounds that inhibit PTER and leads to weight loss. They found that inhibition of PTER, a key enzyme that regulates N-acetyltaurine metabolism, leads to N-acetyltaurine accumulation and a reduction in food intake. Therefore, the use of PTER inhibitors may be an effective way of treating obesity and other metabolic disorders.\nN-acetyltaurine is an abundant endogenous metabolite whose levels are dynamically regulated by diverse physiologic perturbations that increase taurine and/or acetate flux, including endurance exercise, alcohol consumption, and nutritional taurine supplementation. Interestingly, taurine supplementation has been reported to reduce mitochondrial redox stress, enhance exercise performance, and suppress body weight. PTER, an orphan body mass index-associated enzyme, was shown to have N-acetyltransferase/hydrolase activity and be capable of converting taurine to N-acetyltaurine. Genetic ablation of PTER and/or pharmacological administration of N-acetyltaurine in mice resulted in suppressed body weight and adiposity.\nIterative screening for and optimization of PTER inhibitors resulted in the discovery of small molecule inhibitors with a > 250-fold selectivity for PTER. Importantly, treatment with the lead compound caused an increase of N-acetyltaurine in mice and an acute decrease in food intake. Consequently, PTER inhibitors can potentially be used as a method of treatment for obesity and other cardiometabolic disorders.\nStage of Development:\nResearch: in vivo\n\nApplications: Treatment of obesity and other metabolic disorders, Energy balance and body weight control, PTER inhibitors can be administered as a therapeutic.\n\nAdvantages: Novel inhibitors of energy balance linked to taurine metabolism, PTER activity can be inhibited as a method of increasing N-acteyltaurine levels to treat obesity."
Stanford University,Increased Packaging Capacity of Viral Vectors for Genome Editing,Docket #: S24-279,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/increased-packaging-capacity-viral-vectors-genome-editing,"Stanford researchers have developed a method to overcome the packaging capacity limitation of adeno-associated virus (AAV) Vector CRISPR/Cas9 systems to help treat genetic diseases for which the cargo is larger than 4.7kb.\nCRISPR/Cas9 systems have gained momentum in the past decade as a fast, cheap and relatively targeted approach to genome editing. Adeno-associated viral vectors are commonly used to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 due to their efficiency, safety, lower immunogenicity and non-integrative features (i.e. AAV does not integrate into the host genome reducing the likelihood of Cas9 off-target effects). Despite these benefits, one of AAV's shortcomings is its relatively low packaging capacity of 4.7 kb which makes AAV's difficult to use for larger/bulkier cargo.\nTo overcome this packaging limitation, Stanford researchers developed a delivery construct that increases the packaging capacity of recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors. The improvement creates new therapeutic delivery avenues for genetic diseases that have previously fallen outside of the packaging limitation of AAV's such as hemophilia A, cystic fibrosis, duchenne muscular dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, Stargardt Disease, Usher Syndrome 1B, Miyoshi myopathy and more. The advancement also creates opportunities for current CRISPR-based technologies to incorporate the method to improve existing delivery mechanisms.\nStage of Development\nIn vitro data\n\nApplications: Genetic editing of larger genes for gene therapy, Cell engineering in research & industrial applications (i.e. generating cell lines that require the integration of large DNA sequences).\n\nAdvantages: Increased AAV packaging efficiency, Works in diverse cell types such as T-cells, iPSCs, HSPCs, HBECs etc., Can be easily implemented/integrated into current CRISPR/Cas9 systems."

Stanford University,A Novel Mitochondrial-Targeted Treatment for GBM,Docket #: S23-283,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/novel-mitochondrial-targeted-treatment-gbm,"Stanford researchers have developed Miro1 Reducer, a small molecule that targets the mitochondrial protein Miro1 to treat Glioblastoma, addressing the root cause of tumor growth and immune resistance, and demonstrating significant efficacy in reducing tumor size and improving survival in preclinical models.\nGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, with an alarming annual incidence of about 16,000 cases and poor survival rate. Current treatment modalities, including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and even cutting-edge immunotherapies, have failed to provide substantial improvements in patient outcomes. Despite the therapeutic promise shown by immunotherapies in rodent models, their translation to human patients has faced significant hurdles. Moreover, existing treatments often target the immune cells themselves but fail to address the core mechanisms driving GBM proliferation and resistance. There is an urgent need for improved or alternative treatments that target the root cause of GBM.\nTo address this need, Stanford researchers have developed Miro1 Reducer, a small molecule targeting a mitochondrial protein to treat GBM. Mitochondria are crucial for cellular homeostasis and the tumor microenvironment, supporting tumor growth and evasion. Cancerous and adjacent immune cells exhibit metabolic changes including the transfer of mitochondria from non-cancerous to cancer cells, facilitating tumor proliferation. Miro1 Reducer addresses this by targeting the mitochondrial protein Miro1, which is key in these processes. By reducing Miro1 expression in GBM cells, this small molecule hinders metabolic adaptations and immune evasion strategies. In a pilot study, Miro1 Reducer has shown remarkable efficacy in the rescue of tumor size and improving survival in GBM mouse models potentially by suppressing mitochondrial DNA-dependent immune activation, preventing mitochondrial transfer, and promoting mitophagy. In summary, Miro1 Reducer offers a novel mitochondrial-targeted therapy for GBM, effectively reducing tumor size and improving survival in GBM mouse models.\nStage of Development\n In vivo. Next steps include SAS and lead optimization, and FDA-enabling studies.\n\nApplications: Oral drug that Glioblastoma patients can take to prevent tumor growth and improve prognosis, Targeted therapeutics and personalized treatment for Glioblastoma, Potential for treating Parkinson's disease and Friedreich Ataxia.\n\nAdvantages: Currently, no effective treatments exist on the market for Glioblastoma, Miro1 Reducer addresses the root cause of immune resistance and tumor proliferation by targeting the mitochondria, unlike existing methods, which primarily target immune cells.."

Stanford University,Molecules which induce targeted protein relocalization for therapeutic applications,Docket #: S23-381,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/molecules-which-induce-targeted-protein-relocalization-therapeutic-applications,"In many diseases, such as cancers and neurodegenerative disorders, the mislocalization of proteins can disrupt cellular functions and drive disease progression. Traditional therapeutic approaches often fail to address these specific localization issues. To tackle this problem, the researchers at Stanford have developed bifunctional compounds, termed Targeted Relocalization Activating Molecules (TRAMs) which couple the trafficking of a target protein to the trafficking of a shuttle protein, which have strong native localization sequences.\nUsing this strategy of hijacking protein trafficking mechanisms, the researchers have successfully demonstrated the potential to mitigate disease phenotypes, such as reducing stress granules and slowing axonal degeneration. This approach enables gain-of-function pharmacology through relocalization rewiring.\nStage of Development \nProof of concept including in in vitro work and primary neurons.\n\nApplications: Cancer, Neurodegenerative diseases, Metabolic diseases.\n\nAdvantages: Specifically targets protein redistribution, Allows control over subcellular location, Enables gain-of-function pharmacology."
Stanford University,Kirigami electronics for long-term integration and electrophysiological recording of neural organoids and assembloids,Docket #: S22-514,Published Application: WO2024145528,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/kirigami-electronics-long-term-integration-and-electrophysiological-recording-neural,"Stanford researchers have developed kirigami-inspired electronics (KiriE), flexible electronics that transition in suspension from a flat 2D pattern to a 3D basket-like configuration to seamlessly integrate with and chronically record electrical activity from 3D neural organoids and assembloids in suspension. This technology allows for long-term, non-invasive monitoring of electrical activity without disrupting the natural self-organization and development of these 3D cultures.\nTraditional methods of detecting electrical activity in neural organoids involve invasive techniques like patch clamping, slicing, or using rigid electrodes, which can interfere with the development and self-organization of these structures. Additionally, existing  non-invasive methods require the organoids to be in contact with a substrate, potentially affecting their growth and function. The new technology developed by Stanford researchers overcomes these challenges by employing ultra-thin kirigami-inspired electronics (KiriE) that integrate with 3D neural organoids in suspension. This system includes a multifunctional culture platform that supports long-term medium perfusion, multimodal assays, and chronic electrophysiological measurements. The KiriE patterns, specifically designed for high deformability and mechanical durability, adapt to the 3D geometry of the organoids, allowing continuous monitoring over months of development, while preserving their morphology, cytoarchitecture and cell composition.\nStage of Development \nProof of Concept\n\nApplications: Electrical recording from 3D multi-cellular systems in suspension, Long-term monitoring of neural development and activity, Study of neuropsychiatric disorders, Large-scale drug testing platform, Integration with various tissue systems and multi-cellular models, including cardiovascular organoids and 3D bioprinted tissue constructs, Probing multi-synaptic transmission in complex 3D geometries.\n\nAdvantages: Non-invasive long-term recording from 3D cultures, Does NOT interfere with 3D cytoarchitecture or development of organoids, Enables continuous monitoring over months, Multifunctional platform for medium perfusion, live-cell imaging, real-time electrophysiology measurements and optogenetic modulation, High deformability and mechanical durability of KiriE patterns, Stable integration with intact neural organoids in suspension without the need for insertion, slicing or contacting the substrate."
Stanford University,Tuberculosis epitope targets for vaccine development,Docket #: S24-176,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/tuberculosis-epitope-targets-vaccine-development,"Stanford scientists have identified tuberculosis (TB) epitopes preferentially recognized by T cells in patients who naturally resist or control TB infection. Targeting these epitopes for vaccine development could lead to effective vaccines for TB.\nTB is a significant global health problem that has been worsening in recent years with 1.6 million deaths in 2021. Despite the high mortality caused by TB, many individuals that test positive for TB have no symptoms and do not spread the bacteria to others. These patients have a latent TB infection and their immune system were able to successfully control the TB infection. Additionally, some patients have had significant exposure to TB and are not only asymptomatic but also test negative for a TB infection. This suggests that these individuals remain uninfected or rapidly clear their infection early on following exposure. The adaptive immune systems of these patients have likely targeted a TB epitope which is highly effective and ideal antigen candidates for vaccine design.\nA TB epitope that is recognized by CD4 T cells in patients that are naturally resistant to TB has been identified. Importantly, an improved antigen discovery library is expected to identify additional targets which could be highly relevant for TB vaccine design.\nStage of Development:\nin vitro\n\nApplications: Development of vaccines against TB, Increasing vaccine efficacy against TB.\n\nAdvantages: Epitopes that are preferentially targeted by individuals resistant to TB infections, Identification of several epitopes for vaccine design."
Stanford University,Tau-targeting therapy for Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies,Docket #: S22-503,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/tau-targeting-therapy-alzheimers-disease-and-other-tauopathies,"Stanford researchers have developed a targeted therapy for Alzheimer's disease that focuses on inhibiting the spread of tau protein, a key factor in disease progression. By repurposing FDA-approved drugs, this novel approach offers a practical and timely intervention for treating Alzheimer's and related tauopathies.\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a global health crisis, marked by the buildup of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) primarily composed of tau protein. A critical factor in AD progression is the propagation of tau protein, which drives the spread of disease pathology throughout the brain, leading to neuronal damage and accelerated cognitive decline. Current therapeutic approaches mainly target amyloid plaques, another hallmark of AD, but have shown limited success. This has resulted in a significant gap in effective treatments that can halt or reverse the progression of AD, underscoring the urgent need for new therapeutic strategies. The propagation of tau protein presents an untapped opportunity for developing novel interventions.\nOur invention addresses this unmet need by targeting tau protein propagation, offering a novel and previously unexplored therapeutic pathway. Stanford researchers have delved into the mechanisms underlying tau propagation and identified specific sequences responsible for this activity. Leveraging this knowledge has enabled the screening of a range of bio-reagents, which identified candidates capable of inhibiting tau propagation. Several of these bio-reagents are FDA-approved drugs, which opens the door to drug repurposing, a strategy that can significantly expedite the development and approval process. In summary, this invention marks a significant advancement in AD treatment by introducing a novel approach that directly targets tau propagation using FDA-approved drugs, thereby offering a practical and timely intervention for treating Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies.\nStage of Development:\nResearch - in vitro. The next steps include increasing the test sample size and begining testing on animal AD models.\n\nApplications: Novel treatment approach for Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies, Combination therapy potential.\n\nAdvantages: There are no existing effective therapies for Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies, Repurposing FDA-approved drugs allows for faster transition to clinical trials, Reduces costs and regulatory hurdles, Broad application extending to other tauopathies, Personalized treatment plans based on patient profiles."

This condition presents a unique inheritance pattern: males who lack PCDH19 are unaffected, while heterozygous females experience severe symptoms due to random X-chromosome inactivation, leading to disrupted cell-cell interactions in the forebrain.\nTo address this, the researchers at Stanford designed a series of ASOs to modulate the splicing and reduce the levels of PCDH19. By applying these ASOs directly to dissociated cells from human cortical organoids, they identified one ASO that effectively reduced PCDH19 expression.\nStage of Development \nProof of concept: in organoid models\n\nApplications: Epilepsies in children.\n\nAdvantages: Targeted therapy."
Stanford University,A Novel Method for Detecting Lytic Human Herpesvirus 6 in T cell Therapies to Identify Patients at Risk of Encephalitis and Enable Safety Screening of T cell Products,Docket #: S22-277B,Published Application: WO2024035951,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/novel-method-detecting-lytic-human-herpesvirus-6-t-cell-therapies-identify-patients-risk,"Stanford scientists have developed a method to detect reactivated human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) in T cell therapies using genomics technologies, including single-cell sequencing. Detecting lytic herpesvirus 6 in T cell therapies can identify patients at risk of encephalitis and assist in ensuring the safety of T cell products.\nCell therapies have yielded durable clinical benefits for patients with cancer but have been accompanied by unexpected side effects. For instance, approximately 1 in 40-100 patients who undergo CAR T cell therapy suffer from HHV-6 encephalitis. Unexpectedly, the source of the lytic HHV-6 virus can come from the cell therapy itself. Therefore, the detection of lytic HHV-6 in T cell therapies can serve as a diagnostic tool to identify patients at risk of encephalitis and as a safety screening method for T cell products.\nUsing single-cell sequencing, a rare polyclonal population of HHV-6 'super-expressors' (~1 in 360-10,000 cells) that possess high viral transcription and lytic activity late in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell culture were identified in vitro. Further, through the reanalysis of single-cell sequencing data from FDA-approved cell therapy products, the presence of CAR+, HHV-6+  super-expressor T cells were detected in vivo. Together, this implicates the T cell therapy as a potential source of lytic HHV-6 reported in multiple clinical trials and has broad implications for the design, screening, and diagnosis of unexpected toxicities in cell therapies.\nStage of Development:\nPreclinical – in-vivo data\n\nApplications: Identification of patients likely to develop HHV-6 encephalitis who receive T cell therapies, Safety screening autologous and allogenic CAR T cells for HHV6 virus in vitro for HHV-6 via genomics technologies, Screening of patient samples to detect HHV6  in cells, including the cell therapies, in vivo.\n\nAdvantages: In cell therapies, there is no standard / routine screening for HHV-6, so this represents a significant conceptual advance, Utilizes standard / widely-available tools (experimental and computational) to identify HHV6 expression in cells, Uses easily-adoptable molecular biology reagents (including genomics tools) and informatics pipelines with custom downstream analyses to confidently call HHV6 expression.."

After ligation the circular DNA molecules are isolated and used for either direct qPCR readout or library preparation and subsequent NGS readout. The additional proof-reading step enabled through DNA complementarity increases the specificity of the assay by suppressing random background ligation events and makes the assay compatible with low affinity capture reagents.

Stanford University,Development of Novel Polyacrylamides for Use as Broad-spectrum Antibiotics,Docket #: S22-266,Published Application: WO2023244605,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/development-novel-polyacrylamides-use-broad-spectrum-antibiotics,"Stanford scientists have developed novel polyacrylamide-based copolymers that exhibit antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria through a membrane disruption mechanism. This approach of using polyacrylamides to selectively disrupt bacterial membranes as a killing mechanism is able to circumvent known antimicrobial resistance pathways. Consequently, this technology could play a significant role in addressing the growing antibiotic resistance crisis.\nAntimicrobial resistance is a critical global health threat, with antibiotic-resistant pathogens projected to cause over ten million annual deaths by 2050. Despite this crisis, the development of new antibiotic classes has stagnated while resistant bacteria rapidly emerge. Common resistance mechanisms include drug uptake inhibition, drug target modification, and enhanced drug efflux. Broad-spectrum antibiotics that disrupt bacterial membranes are an attractive solution that could potentially bypass these mechanisms, but existing compounds face challenges in synthesis, scalability, toxicity, and/or stability. Polyacrylamides offer promise in addressing these issues, with inexpensive scalable synthesis and high chemical stability enabling potential global distribution without cold chain requirements.\nThe synthesized polyacrylamide compounds demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative (E. coli and K. pneumoniae) and Gram-positive (S. aureus and E. faecium) bacteria, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) approaching clinically relevant levels. Importantly, these polymers exhibit selectivity in killing bacteria over lysing red blood cells, with a 50% hemolytic concentration (HC50) more than twenty times higher than their MICs. They exhibit antimicrobial activity through a membrane-disruption mechanism that is able to delay or prevent the development of resistance in E. coli over 15 passages. They also improve the potency of existing antibiotics and prevent or delay the development of resistance to existing antibiotics when delivered in a combination therapy. The broad-spectrum activity of these polyacrylamides, combined with their membrane-disrupting mechanism, indicates effectiveness against bacterial infections while circumventing common resistance mechanisms. This demonstrates the potential of these compounds to replace or rehabilitate existing antibiotics.\nFigure\nStage of Development\nPreclinical: in-vitro data\nContinued research: Expanding library of novel polyacrylamides to screen for high antimicrobial activity and low hemolytic activity.

Stanford University,Use of recombinant osteopontin (SPP1) protein for prevention of foreign body response,Docket #: S23-249,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/use-recombinant-osteopontin-spp1-protein-prevention-foreign-body-response,"Researchers at Stanford University have found that recombinant osteopontin (SPP1) protein reduces foreign body response (FBR) and thereby facilitates successful integration and function of implantable devices.\nFBR is an immune response in which detected foreign material is encapsulated in dense fibrotic scar tissue. While this response is crucial for protecting the body from bioactive foreign substances, it can be a problem when implants are intentionally placed in the body for treatment. FBR against these implants can lead to complications such as malfunction, infection, soft tissue disfigurement, and pain. Acellular dermal matrix (ADM) has been used as a coating on implants to effectively attenuate FBR, despite an incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Given that ADM is expensive and not easily scalable, it is important to identify alternatives by uncovering its mechanisms of action.\nStanford researchers have discovered that SPP1, upregulated by ADM, is necessary and sufficient for FBR attenuation. When a recombinant-SPP1-loaded hydrogel was placed adjacent to an implant, the fibrotic capsule was thinner compared to the conventional FBR. Additionally, the connective tissue architecture within the fibrotic encapsulation was comparable to that derived from ADM-coated implants. Directly managing FBR's main underlying driver SPP-1 could lead to significant improvements in biocompatibility of implantable devices.\nFigure\nStage of Development\nIn vivo data\n\nApplications: Biomedical implants, Biomedical devices.\n\nAdvantages: Cost effective, Scalable."
Stanford University,Differentiable Beamforming: Dynamic Optimization of Ultrasound Imaging Parameters for Enhanced Image Quality and Diagnostic Accuracy,Docket #: S23-113,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/differentiable-beamforming-dynamic-optimization-ultrasound-imaging-parameters-enhanced,"Stanford researchers have developed a novel approach to ultrasound imaging using the differentiable beamforming pipeline, which optimizes critical imaging parameters, significantly enhancing image quality and diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging.\nUltrasound imaging is a well-established diagnostic tool in medicine, due to its non-invasive imaging capabilities. While the performance of ultrasound imaging relies on the accuracy of the imaging parameters, these parameters are often empirically determined and remain fixed for a given imaging device. This reliance on fixed parameters can result in images of poor quality in situations where the initial assumptions fail and might not accurately reflect the underlying biological structures. This limitation hinders achieving high-quality imaging necessary for an accurate diagnosis.\nTo address this need, Stanford researchers have developed a novel approach to ultrasound imaging using the differentiable formulation of the beamforming pipeline which adjusts parameters based on the specific imaging context. The software allows the system to learn and continuously optimize parameters during the imaging process, ensuring that the settings are always aligned with the current imaging environment. This approach differs from the static parameters used in traditional ultrasound imaging which is set for a given imaging device. Stanford researchers have demonstrated the efficacy of this technology in optimizing sound speed and element position for flexible arrays which are critical for accurate ultrasound imaging, resulting in more reliable imaging parameter estimates. By leveraging the differentiable formulation of the beamforming pipeline, our invention offers an innovative solution through optimization of imaging parameters, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy and driving the future of ultrasound imaging technology.\nStage of Development:\nProof of Concept.

This highlights the need for an alternative diagnostic technique.\nStanford researchers have combined a single-nucleotide infrared (SnIR) fluorescent dye and a complex sugar maltotriose moiety to achieve specific and sensitive detection of bacterial infections.

Stanford University,Enhancing Gene Targeting Efficiency in Human Cells with AZD7648 Treatment,Docket #: S22-103,Published Application: WO2023220418,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/enhancing-gene-targeting-efficiency-human-cells-azd7648-treatment,"Stanford researchers have developed AZD7648, a novel DNA-PK inhibitor that enhances HDR efficiency in CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing by shifting DNA repair from the error-prone NHEJ pathway to the precise HDR pathway, significantly improving gene targeting outcomes in human cells for effective ex vivo gene therapies.\nEx vivo gene therapy is a powerful approach, which involves genetically modifying human cells outside the body using CRISPR-Cas9 technology and then reintroducing them into the patient for treatment of genetic disorders and cancers. Genetic modifications using CRISPR-Cas9 occurs by creating double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in DNA, repaired by either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR). HDR is more precise but less consistent across different genomic loci due to the inconsistency in the levels of HDR activity, often leading to repairs by error-prone NHEJ pathway resulting in suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Though DNA-PK inhibitors have been used to improve HDR efficiency, results are inconsistent across different human cell types. There is an urgent need for innovative solutions that enhance HDR efficiency in different genomic loci and cell types.\nTo address this need, Stanford researchers have developed AZD7648, a novel potent DNA-PK inhibitor to enhance the HDR efficiency in CRISPR-Cas9 based gene editing across different genomic loci. By inhibiting the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a key component of NHEJ repair pathway, AZD7648 shifts the DNA repair mechanism towards the HDR pathway, allowing for more precise gene modifications.

Stromal cell-derived factor-1? (SDF-1?) is a key regulator of that effectively localizes endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to ischemic areas by inducing angiogenesis and increases cardiac cell survival. Normally, SDF and its analogs requires a direct injection to the heart with an open chest surgery.

It allows researchers to dissect complex genetic interactions and cellular responses at single-cell resolution to investigate gene functions and regulatory networks. However, existing methods for perturb-seq are expensive (often in excess of $1.5MM) and have limited efficiency.\nStanford researchers therefore developed a new method that uses an innovative circularized capture approach to directly read out the sgRNA, ensuring stable capture efficiency across different cell types and enabling multiplexed delivery of distinct sgRNAs.

Stanford University,On-chip laser microdissection for single cell sorting,Docket #: S23-293,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/chip-laser-microdissection-single-cell-sorting,"Stanford researchers have developed a new on-chip system for laser microdissection that enables more reliable isolation of single cells or small regions of tissue and permits long-term sample storage.\nLaser microdissection enables scientists to precisely visualize specific cells or small regions of tissue under a microscope and isolate them for downstream analysis. This is especially critical when analyzing specific cell types in heterogenous samples like tumors. However, available instruments for laser microdissection have significant drawbacks, as they are unable to reliably isolate single cells, are error-prone, and struggle with physical influences such as electrostatics. Additionally, such open systems leave samples prone to contamination and cannot reliably store samples for later analysis.\nStanford researchers therefore developed an improved system combining laser microdissection with microfluidics. Cells are isolated using a laser and dispensed into buffer running through a microfluidic chip, where a system of valves sorts different samples. In contrast to systems that rely on gravity, this allows for reliable and standardized sample isolation. This also protects samples from contamination and enables their long-term storage. Additionally, a miniaturized format allows for cheap and easy integration into upstream imaging and downstream analysis workflows.\nStage of Development\nPrototype: Reserachers have demonstrated isolation of cell shapes from a sample and their transportation though the microfluidic chip\n\nApplications: Precise cell isolation and analysis for basic biology research, Single-cell genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics, Single cell analysis for drug development, Analysis of patient samples for diagnostics and biomarker discovery, Label-free enrichment of rare cell populations, Generation of monoclonal colonies.\n\nAdvantages: Reliable and standardized sample collection, Closed system protects sample from contamination and permits easy sample storage, Can be automated, Can integrate with upstream tissue processing and downstream analysis platforms, Miniaturization permits inexpensive integration with other imaging platforms."

When used with PPMS® the system can reach a 2 K base temperature and magnetic field up to 12 T.  The polyimide-based strain probe's in-situ camera monitors material deformation in real time which allows tuning and continuous measurement at cryogenic temperatures without breaking vacuum or warming up. The unique polyimide support can achieve larger tensile strain values (above 10%) compared to bulk samples which are limited to less than 2%.  Strain symmetries and directions can be precisely aligned relative to the material's principle axes, unlike bulk-sample-based piezo-setup where the strain direction is constrained by the shape of the bulk samples.

Eukaryotic genomes are generally compacted into chromatin except for the active regulatory elements that control gene activity.  The spatial organization of these accessible elements is linked to gene expression, replication and DNA repair, however the in situ organization is largely unknown.  To overcome this, the inventors have developed the ATAC-see method.  It uses a novel bifunctional enzyme complex.   When the complex is placed on cell samples it simultaneously makes the active regulatory DNA fluorescent and ready for sequencing.   This method enables direct imaging of the accessible genome in situ, cell sorting, and deep sequencing to reveal the identity of the imaged elements.  ATAC-see provides a combination of spatial and epigenomic information for a molecular portrait of the cell.\nStage of research\nThe ATAC-see method has been used to examine the spatial organization of the accessible genome in its native context for a variety of cell types, including five human cell types.\n\nApplications: Research:\n\nSingle cell analysis\nMorphological identification of diseased cells\nProspective sorting of cells based on regulatory DNA status\nIdentification of regulatory DNA by imaging and sequencing, Single cell analysis, Morphological identification of diseased cells, Prospective sorting of cells based on regulatory DNA status, Identification of regulatory DNA by imaging and sequencing.\n\nAdvantages: New method to:\n\nCapture spatial information on regulatory DNA in intact cell\nSort cells based on status of regulatory DNA\nImage and sequence DNA from the same sample, Capture spatial information on regulatory DNA in intact cell, Sort cells based on status of regulatory DNA, Image and sequence DNA from the same sample, Allows identification of epigenomic information from formalin-fixed cells, including clinical samples, Integrated preassembled system that performs imaging and sequence library preparation at the same time, Easy quality control for DNA sequencing libraries, Labeling strategy is compatible with different fluorophores and chemical tags compatible with multimodal imaging of landmark proteins."

The accumulation of fragmented mitochondria in otherwise healthy tissue results in a heightened inflammatory state that contributes to disease pathology, reduces cellular ATP levels, increases reactive oxygen species and triggers cell death. Drp1 mediates both physiological mitochondrial fission, a process essential for maintaining mitochondrial quality and functioning. as well as pathological (excessive) fission.  Therefore, Drp1 has proven difficult to drug on account of its important role in maintaining normal mitochondrial physiology.\nInventors from Stanford's Mochly-Rosen lab have identified a small molecule that targets a druggable site on the Drp1 protein, specifically blocking a its interaction with a partner protein that mediates its pathological responses- retaining normal function of Drp1 while blocking its pathological activity.\nThe small molecule replicates the previously characterized activity of peptide P110, but without the inherent limitations of a peptide drug. P110 is not orally bioavailable, has a limited penetration to the brain and has a short halflife in vivo, thus limiting its translational potential.  The small molecule mimicking the activity of P110 is expected to overcome these pharmacokinetic barriers.\nIn a mouse model of sepsis, the small molecule increased survival in animals challenged with LPS with nanomolar potency, while also improving symptom scores.\n\nApplications: Small molecule therapeutic for the treatment of:, Neurodegeneration, Sepsis, Myocardial infarction.\n\nAdvantages: New chemical entity and associated chemical space, Improved pharmacokinetics over existing Drp1 inhibitor, invented by the same laboratory, Improved selectivity to pathological Drp1 functions only, Binding mechanism retains baseline activity levels of Drp1."

Typically, Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) is electroporated into cells and induces a double-stranded break at a target site in the genome, while AAV delivers single-stranded DNA repair templates into the nucleus. The cell then employs endogenous DNA repair machinery to fix the Cas9-induced break using the AAV-delivered DNA as a template. This strategy has been used to make both small changes and large insertions in the genome, enabling both cures for genetic disorders as well as immune cell engineering for the treatment of cancers and autoimmune disorders.\nHowever, Stanford researchers recently discovered that a large proportion of cells (~50% or more) edited in this way contain target-site concatemeric knockins of the AAV genome. Critically, these concatemeric knockins greatly affect the level of gene expression but cannot be readily detected by commonly used assays. Researchers therefore developed novel strategies to detect these knockins as well as an approach to greatly decrease their occurrence.\nStage of Development\nPreclinical: Researchers demonstrated a protocol to detect concatemeric knockins and reduce their occurrence by ~10-fold.\n\nApplications: Improved AAV/Cas9 mediated precision gene insertions, Treatment of genetic disorders, including sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, and epidermolysis bullosa, Ex vivo cell engineering, including CAR-T, Detection of concatemeric viral vector insertions and other complex genotypes, Prevention of concatemeric viral vector insertions.\n\nAdvantages: No existing methods to detect and reduce concatemeric knockins, Protocol requires minimal modification to existing gene editing pipelines."

These bacteria help digest our food, protect us from infection, and regulate our immune system. Accordingly, alterations in the human microbiome are associated with diseases ranging from diabetes to cardiovascular disease, and therapeutics that alter the microbiome represent a promising approach to treating a wide range of disorders. However, deciphering the roles of bacterial strains in disease has remained a major challenge, due to the large number of unique bacteria that compose the microbiome and their variability from individual to individual.\nResearchers therefore developed an approach that integrates microbiome analysis and multi-omics to better understand the roles of different members of the microbiome. Levels of immune markers and co-culture of immune cell organoids with different commensal bacteria further inform their role in the immune system. Using this approach, researchers discovered bacterial strains that could treat high cholesterol and insulin resistance or act as vaccine adjuvants. This strategy has broad applicability in creating new therapeutics that act by altering the microbiome.\nStage of Development\nClinical data: microbiome data, multi-omics, and clinical markers collected from 86 individuals over up to 6 years.\n\nApplications: Diagnosis of disease and disease progression through a microbiome signature, Microbiome-based therapeutics, including personalized therapeutics, Discovery of bacterial strains that can act as vaccine adjuvants.\n\nAdvantages: Simultaneous analysis of microbiome and immune response, Comprehensive multi-omics analysis, Personalized approach."

Stanford University,Cold Gas Stream Method for CryoEM Sample Grid Vitrification,Docket #: S22-149,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/cold-gas-stream-method-cryoem-sample-grid-vitrification,"Stanford researchers have developed an innovative technology for cryo-vitrification using a temperature-controlled cold gas stream instead of traditional liquid cryogen, which prevents grid distortion, enabling gentle sample cooling and continuous imaging throughout the vitrification process.\nTraditional cryo-vitrification methods which involve a plunge freezing or blot-less deposition or spraying liquid cryogen on cryoEM grids for vitrification encounter numerous challenges, from grid distortion and damage, imaging limitations, complex sample handling, equipment dependencies and constraints on time-resolved experiments. There is an urgent need for a solution that addresses these challenges for cryoEM sample preparation.\nStanford researchers have developed a technology which addresses these issues by simplifying the vitrification process. Instead of submerging samples in liquid cryogen, this innovation uses a novel approach which exposes the sample and cryoEM grid to a temperature-controlled cold-gas stream delivered via a cryo-nozzle, which eliminates grid distortion and allows continuous imaging before, during, and after vitrification. Prior to vitrification, the gas stream is blocked to prevent premature cooling. Upon activation, the cold gas rapidly cools the sample grid, ensuring efficient vitrification. Since the sample and cryoEM grid do not move during the vitrification process and not submerged in a cryogen, the grids can be continuously imaged using an optical microscope and exposed to various triggers for time-resolved measurements during and after vitrification. Additionally, the sample-grid can safely remain in the cold gas stream for other operations and removed using a specialized cryo-tong (also part of this invention) and saved for cryoEM imaging. In summary, this innovation overcomes the limitations of traditional cryo-vitrification methods, offering a comprehensive solution for advanced sample preparation in cryoEM research.\nStage of Development:\nPrototype.

Stanford University,BRINP3-derived peptides – A Breakthrough in Obesity Treatment,Docket #: S24-073,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/brinp3-derived-peptides-breakthrough-obesity-treatment,"Stanford researchers have discovered BRP3, a novel peptide derived from the BRINP3 protein, which effectively reduces food intake and body fat in mice, while preserving muscle mass, thus offering a novel, safe and effective solution to treat obesity.\nObesity is a major global health concern expected to affect over 25% of the global population by 2035. It shortens life expectancy by 5-10 years and increases the risk of death from diabetes, heart disease, and other related conditions. Current weight loss methods, including caloric restriction and existing weight loss drugs, often lead to muscle mass reduction, compromising overall health and physical function. Combination therapies have been explored, but no current treatment prevents muscle loss while promoting weight loss. Effective drugs that can reverse obesity without causing significant side effects, including loss of muscle mass, remain an unmet need.\nTo address this, Stanford researchers have discovered a novel peptide (BRP3) derived from the human BRINP3 protein that reverses obesity without causing muscle loss. BRP3 is a peptide cleaved from the parent protein BRINP3 and detected in human plasma. When administered to diet-induced obese mice, the peptide BRP3 reduced food intake within 30 minutes of a single injection, with effects lasting up to 3 hours. Subsequent studies showed that daily administration of BRP3 in diet-induced obese mice led to significant weight loss by 10% and improved glucose tolerance, with weight loss attributed to a reduction in subcutaneous and visceral fat mass, without changes in skeletal or heart muscle mass.\nIn summary, this invention introduces BRP3, a BRINP3 peptide, which combats obesity by suppressing food intake and body fat without affecting muscle mass, showcasing its therapeutic potential as a safe and promising anti-obesity treatment.\nStage of Development:\nIn vivo.

Species cross-reactivity enables direct testing of the antibody in murine models without modification, providing a better prediction of efficacy in humans.\nNKp46 is an emerging NK cell receptor that has recently been receiving attention as a target for increasing NK cell cytotoxicity and proliferation. Currently available antibodies against NKp46 are only capable of binding a single species ortholog (e.g. only human or only murine), which has necessitated significant modifications to the antibody to enable testing in preclinical mouse models. Species cross-reactive antibodies that bind to NKp46 would make it possible to validate an unmodified antibody in preclinical models before progressing into human clinical trials.\nThe species cross-reactive antibodies displayed nanomolar affinity to human, murine and cyno NKp46. The antibodies enabled NK cell proliferation and expansion. Importantly, bispecific antibodies constructed with these antibodies demonstrated increased cytotoxicity of both human and mouse NK cells towards tumor cells as compared to their monospecific counterparts.

Stanford University,Thermal process to transform silicate minerals into alkaline solids for carbon removal,Docket #: S23-304,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/thermal-process-transform-silicate-minerals-alkaline-solids-carbon-removal,"Stanford researchers in the Kanan Lab have developed a scalable method for achieving verifiable, safe, and permanent carbon removal at relatively low energy demand.\nThis work demonstrates that calcium oxide can react with diverse magnesium silicates to form calcium silicate and magnesium oxide. When exposed to air and moisture, these products convert to dissolved bicarbonate ions or carbonate minerals, sequestering CO2. By cycling this chemistry with calcium carbonate calcination, a new carbon dioxide removal process emerges where the calcium/magnesium products capture CO2 from air as stable (bi)carbonates while process emissions are sequestered.\nStudies shows this could provide efficient CO2 removal using less than half the energy of leading direct air capture technologies. If applied to soils, the calcium silicate/magnesium oxide materials could provide agronomic value as a silicon fertilizer. The process unlocks magnesium silicates as an abundant resource for safe, permanent atmospheric carbon removal with co-benefits.\nStage of Development\n\nApplications: Large-scale removal of CO2 from the atmosphere (carbon dioxide removal or CDR), Agronomic input to provide plant-available silicon and soil pH adjustment, Can provide high quality carbon offsets  that could be purchased by any company or other entity that seeks to offset their GHG emissions or contribute to CO2 drawdown, Safe and permanent sequestration of captured CO2 as stable dissolved bicarbonates or carbonate minerals.\n\nAdvantages: Much lower energy requirements compared to leading direct air capture (DAC) technologies (less than half the energy per ton of CO2 removed), Produces stable and environmentally benign carbonate minerals  for CO2 sequestration, Utilizes abundant magnesium-rich silicate rocks  as a vast feedstock resource, Verifiable and permanent removal of CO2 from the air, Potential to improve crop yields and resistance to pests."

Tr1 cells. Currently, we do not have means for in vivo therapeutic targeting of Tr1 cells, but Tr1 cells differentiated in vitro have a potent therapeutic potential. However, in vitro differentiated Tr1 cell therapy products, called T-allo10 cells, contain ~10% of Tr1 cells.   Thus, strategies to target Tr1 cell differentiation in vivo and generate purified Tr1 cell products in vitro can provide therapeutic benefit in wide variety of human diseases.\nInventors at Stanford developed a method targeting master regulator transcription factors of Tr1 cells to increase the efficacy of their differentiation and manipulate their functions. Master regulators are key transcription factors that regulate cell lineage identity, differentiation and functions.

Once this early window has been missed, the 5-year survival rate precipitously drops below 50%. Due to the current lack of effective screening modalities targeting early ovarian carcinomas, only ~15% are detected during the early stage--these lucky few cases are usually detected incidentally, during an imaging procedure carried out for unrelated reasons. If a rapid, cheap, easily accessible screening modality for early ovarian cancer were to be created, patient outcomes would drastically improve. Dr. Blankenberg and colleagues at Stanford invented a detection method using exosomes - small vesicles that are prolifically shed into the blood by tumor cells with molecular characteristics of their parent cells.

With a gene therapy vector, a more predictable and stable treatment is possible to treat glaucoma and inflammatory conditions of the eyes when utilizing specific gene targets.  The Mahajan Laboratory at Stanford used tissue culture in vitro to identify a minimal DNA promotor to drive gene expression in the NPCECs.  The method has shown that a BEST2 minimal promoter (specific to NPCECs gene expression) can be manipulated and linked to a sequence of gene encoding of interest in the NPCECs to treat eye disease.  Primarily, NPCECs are linked to glaucoma which affects 60 million people worldwide with no cure.

With these biomarkers, a more efficient and reliable approach compared to conventional methods (mainly clinical findings and gram stains/cultures) can be used to treat uveitis caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, helminths, or parasites. Instead of waiting days or weeks for laboratory results to determine microbial content, use of biomarkers to identify the etiology of uveitis is faster, more accurate, and more reliable.  Particularly in ocular inflammatory cases, waiting for the correct diagnosis and treatment (50% of cases are idiopathic) can cause visual impairment, and ultimately blindness due to the recurrent and chronic nature of the disease process.

By leveraging deep learning models and single-cell analysis, this method identifies robust biomarkers associated with treatment outcomes.\nEsophagogastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, posing a significant health concern. While immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is the standard of care and has shown remarkable efficacy, its benefits vary widely among patients. Many patients fail to experience benefits from these expensive treatments, highlighting the urgent need for reliable predictive biomarkers. Existing biomarker tests like PD-L1 immunohistochemistry suffer from inaccuracies and high variability, leaving patients to endure ineffective treatments, toxic side effects, and financial strain. This discrepancy underscores a critical challenge and highlights a urgent need for reliable biomarkers for predicting immunotherapy treatment response.\nTo address this problem, Stanford researchers have developed an innovative AI-driven solution for predicting immunotherapy response in esophagogastric cancer patients. By conducting single-cell analysis of standard histopathology images from immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated patients, this methodology accurately forecasts treatment outcomes. By leveraging deep learning models and fully automated cell annotation, this approach provides a comprehensive analysis of the tumor microenvironment, including cell density, composition, and spatial interactions, thereby identifying robust biomarkers associated with treatment outcomes.

However, taking such measurements can be an invasive process, including the need for connective devices with wires and other conduits. The passage of such wires into an organism can create opportunities for infection and they often need to be removed once the measurements are complete.

Stanford University,Dialysis-Based Method for Affinity Mapping of Chromatin Interactions,Docket #: S23-484,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/dialysis-based-method-affinity-mapping-chromatin-interactions,"Researchers at Stanford have developed methods for preparing chromatin from cells for downstream genomic chromatin mapping.\nChromatin profiling strategies are widely used to map the genomic location of chromatin elements, such as histone post-translational modification and chromatin associated proteins. Though there are various different techniques to perform this profiling, they each tend to suffer from the same drawbacks, which limit their utility under certain conditions. For instance, some assays include incubating permeabilized cells with enzymes, where the nuclear envelope retains the chromatin structure and interacting biomolecules. However, this precludes anucleated cells, such as bacteria, or in cells undergoing cell division. In addition, substantial wash and centrifugation steps can introduce unwanted variability and produce negative impacts on chromatin quality that can hamper downstream analysis. Therefore, there is a need in the art for improved methods for sample preparation for chromatin mapping with lower starting material, minimal handling steps, and a non-reliance on the nuclear membrane.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a single vessel (i.e. a """"one-pot"""") method for preparing samples for genome wide mapping of protein-DNA interactions. Compatible workflows can include DiMeLo-seq, or other methods such as CUT&RUN or CUT&TAG. In this method, wash steps have been replaced with a series of dilution and/or precipitation steps that enable addition of components that would otherwise interfere with downstream workflow steps above a certain concentration.\nStage of Development\nResearch – in vitro\n\nApplications: Determining the genomic location of at least one biomolecule-genomic DNA interaction., Sample preparation with DiMeLo-seq., Chromatin profiling approaching using tethered enzymes such as CUT&RUN..\n\nAdvantages: The one-pot or single vessel method can drastically shorten the overall time and workload., Lower sample requirements., Minimized handling steps., Allow chromatin preparation in the absence of a nuclear envelope., Provide reliable performance in downstream profiling techniques.."

Due to their desirable band gaps and high absorption coefficient, TMDs are promising for next generation, high specific power solar cells.  Current TMD fabrication methods rely on exfoliating small flakes from a bulk TMD crystal, which does not produce full, mass production friendly, multi-layer films.\nThe Pop Lab deposited wafer-scale, multilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) films by selenizing pre-deposited, pre-patterned tungsten with solid source selenium and H2Se precursors (See Fig. 1). These WSe2 films yield a charge carrier lifetime of up to 144 ns, corresponding to power conversion efficiency of ~22% and specific power of ~64 W g-1 in a packaged solar cell, and ~3 W g-1 in a fully packaged solar module.  Initial focus was WSe2, but the method could be applied to sulfur (instead of selenium), and other transition metals or even other transition metal oxides (e.g. WSe2, WS2, MoSe2, MoS2). This breakthrough could pave the way for mass-production of low cost, high-efficiency, lightweight, flexible, multilayer WSe2 (and other TMD) solar cells that are capable of irregular shapes like a drone wing, car roof, or wearable devices. Alternatively, layered TMDs could be used as contact layers for CdTe and CIGS solar cells.\nFigure 1  Wafer-scale, multilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) film deposition schematic\nImage courtesy the Pop Lab\nStage of Development - Prototype\n\nApplications: Ultra-thin, high-specific-power, transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) solar cells for drones, low-earth-orbit satellites, electric vehicles, and wearable electronics., Contact layer for CdTe and CIGS solar cells.\n\nAdvantages: Multilayer, uniform, full coverage, large-area TMD films as required for high performance solar cells., Mass-production friendly film quality, stability, reliability, scalability, and low cost, Ultra-thin, lightweight, flexible, with high absorption – compared to other solar materials, TMDs absorb ultra-high levels of sunlight.."
Stanford University,Red blood cell-specific transgene expression for treating genetic enzyme deficiencies,Docket #: S21-377,Published Application: WO2023224992,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/red-blood-cell-specific-transgene-expression-treating-genetic-enzyme-deficiencies,"Stanford researchers have developed a new gene editing approach that enables red blood cell-specific gene expression for the treatment of enzyme deficiencies.\nAvailable protein-based enzyme replacement therapies are not curative, require frequent infusions, and often become less effective over time. Similarly, emerging strategies that use a viral vector to deliver a functional copy of the defective gene to the liver are limited by pre-existing neutralizing antibodies, potentially life-threatening immune responses, and a decline in enzyme production over time.\nResearchers therefore developed a new strategy in which red blood cells are turned into enzyme-producing factories, taking advantage of the fact that red blood cells are produced in large numbers and circulate throughout the body. To achieve red blood cell specific gene expression, researchers use ex vivo CRISPR/Cas editing of hematopoietic stem cells to insert a functional copy of the enzyme behind a promoter (HBA1 or HBA2) that is only active in red blood cells. Scientists further optimized this strategy for the treatment of hemophilia B, caused by mutations in factor IX.

Stanford University,Robust 3D printed pyrolytic carbon micro-array patch for transdermal applications,Docket #: S23-282,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/robust-3d-printed-pyrolytic-carbon-micro-array-patch-transdermal-applications,"Researchers at Stanford have combined 3D printing and pyrolysis to produce a robust and biocompatible high resolution micro-array patch (MAP) for transdermal drug delivery.\nMAPs are an innovative transdermal drug delivery system that allows for relatively painless, efficient, and controlled administration of medications through the skin. They are composed of an adhesive backing and an array of drug-eluting microneedles. Additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing, is emerging as the preferred fabrication method for MAPs because it offers more design options and capabilities compared to the conventional silicon microfabrication method. However, the materials currently used to 3D print MAPs have limited printing resolution, are often too soft for complete insertion into the skin, and lose biocompatibility with wear.\nTo overcome these limitations, Stanford researchers used a pyrolytic polymer to manufacture MAPs. They 3D printed the desired micro-array structure using a soft pyrolytic polymer. The printed structure was then subjected to pyrolysis, a thermal decomposition process, to form a miniaturized replica made of hard monolithic carbon. These steps ensured both high-resolution structural details and enhanced mechanical strength and stability, facilitating skin insertion and drug release. Additionally, high electrical conductivity of these MAPs enabled their use in electrochemical sensing.\nFigure:\nStage of Development\nPrototype\n\nApplications: Drug delivery/transfection, electrochemical sensing:\n\nPoint-of-care\nRapid response to pandemic events\nSelf-administration, Point-of-care, Rapid response to pandemic events, Self-administration.\n\nAdvantages: High resolution, Biocompatible, Robust, Design flexibility, Scalable, Low electrical resistance – biomarker detection."

While scientists have discovered the genetic basis for the disorder in many patients (mutations in exon 8A of the calcium channel CACNA1C), there are no available treatments that act on this root cause.\nResearchers therefore developed a treatment strategy to modulate the splicing of CACNA1C. Using human cortical spheroids derived from patient cells, they screened a series of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to identify one that biases pre-mRNA splicing to include the healthy exon 8 instead of the mutated exon 8A. Scientists showed that this candidate could restore calcium defects in patient-derived cortical neurons, influence interneuron migration, and restore activity-dependent dendritic retraction in transplanted cortical organoids. This ASO therefore has significant promise for the treatment of Timothy syndrome.\nStage of Development\nIn vitro: selectively causes mutagenic exon 8A exclusion in patient-derived cortical organoids, restores calcium defects in patient-derived cortical neurons, influences interneuron migration, restores activity-dependent dendritic retraction in transplanted cortical organoids.\n\nApplications: Treatment of Timothy syndrome type 1, ASO development for other CNS disorders using a multi-level patient-derived organoids and assembloids.\n\nAdvantages: No available treatment that acts on the genetic basis of Timothy syndrome, ASO is highly selective for exon 8A exclusion, ASO has been extensively validated in human cellular models."
Stanford University,Chimeric Cytokine Receptors for Enhancing the Efficacy of Cell Therapies,Docket #: S22-208,Published Application: WO2024044768,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/chimeric-cytokine-receptors-enhancing-efficacy-cell-therapies,"Stanford researchers have engineered chimeric cytokine receptors that are expressed in therapeutic cells to enhance their activity and therapeutic potential. To prevent toxicity from hyperactivity, the activation state of these receptors can be regulated by a drug that acts on proteases.\nWhile chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy effectively treats liquid cancers, further improvements in persistence and potency are needed to combat solid cancers clinically. Regulating cytokine-triggered intracellular signaling cascades related to growth and proliferation could help augment CAR-T cell activity, enhancing anti-tumor efficacy.\nTo achieve this, Stanford researchers developed chimeric cytokine receptor (CCR) systems capable of constitutive signaling in the absence of their cognate cytokines. Their CCR system is comprised of two subunits, each including a heterologous dimerization domain and a cytokine receptor intracellular signaling domain (ICD). Because a cognate for the first dimerization domain is selected as the second dimerization domain and the two domains are in proximity, therapeutic cells with these CCRs have active intracellular signaling associated with persistence and potency downstream. The signaling cascade can be interrupted by regulating protease activity on ICDs to avoid exceeding the therapeutic window and causing toxicity. Cells with these CCRs could demonstrate sufficient anti-tumor activity to fight solid tumors.\nStage of Development\nIn vivo data\n\nApplications: Immunotherapy for cancer, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and more:\n\nCAR-T therapy\nTCR therapy\nCAR NK cell therapy, CAR-T therapy, TCR therapy, CAR NK cell therapy.\n\nAdvantages: Has a wide dynamic range of control, Safe, with no leaky activity in the off state, Utilizes an FDA-approved small molecule to regulate cytokine signaling, Can use autologous, allogeneic or stem cell-derived therapeutic cells, Cysteine residues can be included in the extracellular domain to stabilize the CCRs via disulfide bonds, Detection tags can be optionally included for cell surface expression."

While single-cell genomics can identify cell types based on marker transcripts, there are no methods for isolating these populations for further downstream analysis. This is a particular challenge for studying rare cell types, including many involved in disease.\nStanford researchers therefore developed a scalable assay that enables single-cell RNA sequencing profiles from complex subcellular mixtures defined by the presence or absence of RNA transcripts. This new strategy integrates single-molecule nucleic acid imaging (e.g., smFISH) with single-cell sequencing. Researchers were able to enrich and study rare cell populations from immune populations as well as fixed brain tissue.

Diagnosis of celiac disease is determined by presence of transglutaminase 2 (TG2) autoantibody and histology of intestinal biopsies. However, those seeking diagnosis often already maintain a gluten-free diet prior to gastroenterology consultation and therefore test negative for autoantibody and present normal duodenal mucosa. So, it is necessary to have patients receive a gluten-rich diet for weeks to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Celiac patients will thus experience symptoms including diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain. Air-liquid interface (ALI) organoids enable culturing epithelium and stroma to recapitulate the human small intestine, and patient-derived organoids can be used for suspected celiac patient diagnosis instead. ALI organoids could be used whether the individual is on a gluten-free diet or gluten-rich diet.

However, some inadvertently invoke heterologous immunity against non-targeted antigens. This can be leveraged to design pathogen-agnostic universal vaccines. Recent studies suggest that both immunological memory in the adaptive immune system and trained immunity of innate immune system are involved. However, further investigation is needed to identify specific mechanisms to modulate to induce nonspecific immunity.\nStanford researchers have found that the interaction between the adaptive and innate immune systems and non-hematopoietic cells in tissues is key to antigen-agnostic protective immunity. Based on their previous finding that BCG vaccine induces heterologous immunity via CD4 T-cell derived IFN-gamma, which imprints an antiviral state on the innate immune system and epithelial cells, they developed a vaccine containing antigen ovalbumin and GLA/3M-052 adjuvants, which elicit IFN-gamma responses.

Stanford University,Preventing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy using a combination treatment,Docket #: S23-089,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/preventing-chemotherapy-induced-peripheral-neuropathy-using-combination-treatment,"Stanford scientists have developed a working model that chemotherapy drugs induce peripheral neuropathy by activating a pathway that favors neuronal degeneration and impairs sensory neuron function. Combining modulation of factors downstream of this degenerative pathway with chemotherapy represents a promising strategy to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy without compromising tumor growth inhibition.\n40%-60% of patients treated with anticancer drugs develop chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). CIPN symptoms, such as tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, difficulty walking, and other challenges with daily activities, significantly deteriorate the quality of life and commonly develop into persistent, chronic neuropathic pain. As a result, the healthcare costs associated with CIPN are substantial, with treatment expenses for patients suffering from CIPN exceeding those for patients without the condition by $15,000 (in 2006 dollars). With the number of cancer survivors projected to top 20 million by 2030, preventing CIPN is both a pressing and a growing healthcare challenge.\nActivating the neuronal degenerative pathway through overexpression and treatment with a chemotherapy drug in C. elegans impairs touch sensation which recapitulates symptoms if CIPN seen in patients. Importantly, in mice, knockout animals that genetically lack the downstream factors are less sensitive to chemotherapy than their wild-type littermates suggesting inhibition of this pathway may be preventative of CPIN. Importantly, targeting downstream factors makes it unlikely that tumor growth inhibition will be compromised during chemotherapy. Consequently, a combination treatment strategy can potentially prevent or minimize chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in oncology patients.\nStage of Development:\nResearch – in-vivo data\nContinued research – Using several biological models to validate that the pathway is an effective treatment target for preventing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy\n\nApplications: Prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, A combination therapy for cancer treatment.\n\nAdvantages: There are currently no FDA-approved chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy treatments, Potential for few on- or off-target effects."

A significant number of marginal organs are recovered but are not transplanted due to concerns of poor quality, suboptimal function, and limited regenerative capacity. What is critically needed to address this organ shortage are methods that allow for marginal organ rehabilitation, thus enabling them to be successfully transplanted without compromising patient outcomes.\nThere are two features of the proposed technology. The first is a perfusion device that mimics heart function, an oxygenator that mimics lung function, and a dialysis system that mimics kidney function. The second feature is the use of a novel perfusate additive, liposome-packaged human WNT protein (L-WNT). WNTs are potent stem cell activators that activate endogenous stem cells and enhance cell viability, thereby improving engraftment efficiency. The unique perfusion device loosens the narrow time constraints for transplantation, thereby allowing in-depth organ evaluation and clinical intervention. The use of L-WNT raises the possibility of functional liver reconditioning. Such a regenerative intervention has the potential to dramatically reduce organ shortages and in doing so, transform the organ transplantation landscape.\nStage of Development:\nNormothermic perfusion device: in clinical development\nL-WNT: GMP manufacturing complete\n\nApplications: Enable organ procurement organizations (responsible for donor management, organ retrieval, organ preservation, and organ transportation) to retrieve marginal organs and optimize them ex vivo prior to dispersal., Enhance hospital systems with organ transplant programs that are responsible for organ preservation, optimization, and transplantation into intended recipients., Support hospitals with major oncologic and hepatobiliary programs that offer major resections or ablations of partial liver for benign and oncologic conditions..\n\nAdvantages: The technology ameliorates ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI), thus reducing postoperative complications and their associated costs., The normothermic perfusion device with dialysis capabilities allows for sustained holding times, while the L-WNT perfusate additive enhances tissue repair and regeneration through its action on endogenous stem cells., The normothermic perfusion device with dialysis capabilities allows for sustained holding times, while the L-WNT perfusate additive enhances tissue repair and regeneration through its action on endogenous stem cells.."

Lithium dendrite growth is the leading cause of degradation and failure in lithium metal batteries, which has hindered the adoption of the lighter, faster charging, and high energy density batteries.  Stanford researchers modelled the physics and chemistry of lithium dendrite formation and found that anisotropic electrolytes (electrolytes with anisotropic diffusion coefficients of the Li ions) and control of the local electric field can suppress dendritic growth in lithium-metal batteries.   Electrolytes with electric field-dependent diffusion coefficients reduce dendritic growth in small batteries, while anisotropic electrolytes (or separators with anisotropic pore structures or columnized membranes) are appropriate for batteries of any size. Using these guidelines for the development of electrolytes and separators, can improve the safety and longevity of lithium metal batteries.\nStage of Development – Proof of Concept\n\nApplications: Lithium metal battery design.\n\nAdvantages: Safer batteries through mitigating dendrite growth, Lithium-metal batteries with longer life span, More cost-effective - avoids the need to explore & certify new electrolyte chemistries."
Stanford University,Apparatus for sensitive fluorescence optical measurement of biological parameters in freely behaving animals,Docket #: S22-228,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/apparatus-sensitive-fluorescence-optical-measurement-biological-parameters-freely,"Brief Description: Inventors at Stanford have developed a novel fiber-optic technology to achieve unprecedented sensitivity and immunity to motion artifacts that can be used in freely moving animals. The uSMAART (ultra-Sensitive Measurement of Aggregated Activity in Restricted cell-Types) technology enables the study of small dynamic variation of one or more biological process in the healthy and pathological brain from animal undergoing ecologically relevant behavior.\nMore Details: Fiber photometry, a measurement technique that aggregates fluorescence signal using a fiber optic, is a highly pervasive approach in the field of systems neuroscience to study in vivo brain tissue dynamics during ecologically relevant behavior. Despite its common usage by researchers and companies alike, none of the state-of-the art fiber photometry device is capable of detecting small and fast signal changes in a low-light regime in freely behaving animals. Current technologies are benchmarked against cytosolic calcium indicators whose dynamic ranges far exceed that of the instrument and biological noises. Therefore, when used outside of this original configuration, i.e. with other fluorescent indicators (voltage, neuromodulator sensors…) with much weaker dynamic ranges, these instruments do not protect against unwanted noise sources which can lead to biological confounds, especially when the instrumental noise correlates with the animal motion.\nInventors at Stanford have developed a novel fiber-optic technology that achieve ~10 fold greater sensitivity than prior fiber photometry systems and is immune to optical artefacts induced by animal motions. The uSMAART (ultra-Sensitive Measurement of Aggregated Activity in Restricted cell-Types) technology tracks signals from up to 2 reporters from up to 2 different brain regions concurrently, with high sensitivity. The uSMAART system outperforms similar fiber photometry implementations in at least one of the three following aspects: (1) stability of illumination source, (2) immunity to fiber motion-induced illumination artefacts, and (3) detection sensitivity in the visible range. The novel technology offers a low-cost, flexible, and highly sensitive tool to decipher the precise temporal relationship of multiple physiological processes from multiple brain regions simultaneously.\nStage of Development:\nResearch – in vivo – working prototype and proof-of-concept in mice\n\nApplications: Neuroscience research, Medical Diagnostics and Treatment Monitoring, Pharmaceutical Development, Drug discovery platform, Analytic chemistry.\n\nAdvantages: Can be used in freely moving animals, Measurements are immune to instrumental and biological artefacts., High bandwidth, high sensitivity detection of biological parameter dynamics, Simultaneous dual biological parameters with identical performance, such as quadruple processes recordings from two brain regions (two per region) with identical performance, Experimental flexibility to combine multiple fluorescence sensors and monitor signals from multiple, deep brain areas., Universally applicable to any fluorescent reporters, from genetically encoded fluorescent proteins to synthetic dyes and nanoparticles.."
Stanford University,Strategy and technological implementations for concurrent fluorescence measurements of multiple biological parameters in behaving animals,Docket #: S23-493,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/strategy-and-technological-implementations-concurrent-fluorescence-measurements-multiple,"Inventors at Stanford have developed a novel strategy to perform concurrent fluorescence measurements of multiple biological parameters in freely moving and head-restrained animals. As more genetically encoded fluorescent indicators (GEFI) are being developed to monitor, in living animals, a wide range of biological phenomenon (e.g. transmembrane voltage, ions, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, opioids, pH…), optical approaches that capture the precise temporal relationship of many physiological processes simultaneously in awake animals become critically necessary. Unlike our invention, none of the existing technologies offers the experimental flexibility to combine multiple fluorescence sensors and monitor those signals.\nTwo of the most common optical tools in neuroscience to study in vivo brain tissue dynamics during ecologically relevant behavior are fiber photometry and mesoscopic imaging. Fiber photometry is a measurement technique that aggregates fluorescence signal using a fiber optic. While it captures signal at the tip of the fiber, mesoscope imaging will instead capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of the fluorescence signal in awake, head-fixed animals. Recent studies have used both techniques to optically sense voltage, calcium, or neuromodulator dynamics in a variety mouse behavior.\nHowever, none of the state-of-the art fiber photometry devices or 1-photon epifluorescence mesoscope systems are capable of imaging more than 1 biological parameter at once while precisely referencing biological noises. Indeed, until now, there has not been a suitable method to account for various biological artifacts while imaging 2 spectrally orthogonal fluorescent proteins that capture two independent biological parameters. Therefore, while multiplexing fluorescent signals gain more appeal in the field, molecular strategy and technological implementations to achieve this with high sensitivity and low cost is needed.\nHere, we introduce a new molecular strategy and offer two technological implementations for fiber photometry and mesoscope imaging. While the former relies on a lock-in amplification technique, the latter relies on precise control over the illumination activation and imaging frame acquisition. Our simple molecular solution can be used with any fiber photometry systems (used in freely behaving animals) or 1-photon epifluorescence wide-field imaging techniques (used in head-fixed animals) to probe the dynamics of multiple molecular phenomena concurrently in awake animals. This strategy is universally applicable to any fluorescent reporters, from genetically encoded fluorescent proteins to synthetic dyes and nanoparticles. This strategy will reduce by 50% the cost of instrumentations used for fluorescence multiplexing of dynamic processes.\nStage of Development:\nResearch – in vivo – working prototype and proof-of-concept in mice\n\nApplications: Neuroscience research, Medical Diagnostics and Treatment Monitoring, Pharmaceutical Development, Drug discovery platform, Analytic chemistry.\n\nAdvantages: A cost-effective method to multiplex fluorescence signals., Simultaneous dual biological parameters with identical performance, in freely and head-restrained behaving mouse., Safeguarding against instrumental and/or biological artefacts., Universally applicable to any fluorescent reporters, from genetically encoded fluorescent proteins to synthetic dyes and nanoparticles.."
Stanford University,Functionally biased ligands for the Complement 5a Receptor,Docket #: S23-011,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/functionally-biased-ligands-complement-5a-receptor,"Stanford scientists have discovered multiple functionally biased ligands that can selectively activate distinct subsets of signaling pathways downstream of the complement 5a receptor. These ligands will be useful for the scientific study of complement 5a receptor signaling and, more importantly, can potentially be used as therapeutics.\nThe complement 5a receptor (C5aR) is an important cellular receptor that exerts many critical physiological functions, including regulating the immune response and promoting cancer resistance to treatments. It has been shown that C5aR can simultaneously activate many downstream signaling pathways; however, the biological consequences of individual pathways are unclear. The biggest obstacle in the understanding of C5aR signaling is the lack of pharmacological tools to selectively modulate subsets of the signaling pathways and allow the analysis of their biological functions in isolation.\nThere are two major signaling pathways downstream of C5aR: cAMP and beta-arrestin. Various mutants have been discovered: 1) those that completely abolish beta-arrestin signaling, 2) those that partially inhibit the cAMP pathway 3) those that inhibit both beta-arrestin and cAMP pathways. The short-term application of these ligands would be their use as research tools to dissect the signaling pathways downstream of C5aR. In the long term, with a better understanding of the physiological functions of the ligands, they could be used as therapeutics to treat diseases that require the selective activation of the related signaling pathways.\nStage of Development:\nPreclinical – in-vitro data\nContinued research – elucidation of the exact biological function of the ligands\n\nApplications: Use as research tools to dissect C5aR signaling, Therapeutics for diseases that benefit from the selective activation of C5aR.\n\nAdvantages: Selectively activate a subset of C5aR signaling pathways as opposed to complete blockage, Use of peptides leads to much stronger binding affinity."
Stanford University,"Structurally optimized, double-double, metal-like laminate for lightweight fabrication",Docket #: S24-054,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/structurally-optimized-double-double-metal-laminate-lightweight-fabrication,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a composite material that mimics the structural characteristics of metal, with the added benefits of laminates.\nFabrication with durable materials is essential for manufacturing of many composite structures, such a vehicles, airplanes and satellites. Traditionally, these have been fabricated using aluminum due to its durability, but composite laminates would provide a lighter, more cost-effective solution. Despite this, composite laminates, have been difficult to apply due to their complex, non-homogenized nature.\nNow, the Tsai lab at Stanford has proposed a novel double-double laminate design to overcome the challenges of traditional composites. This design enables perfect homogenization, eliminating shear- and stretch-bend coupling. Consequently, it improves upon metals by offering lighter weight, higher stiffness, and better possibilities for tapering. As a result, the double-double laminate solves problems of complexity and sub-optimal outputs associated with previous composites.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Reduced weight and cost of composite structures\n\n\nMedical devices and prosthetics\nAutomotive and aerospace industry\nIndustrial machinery and equipment\nSpace and satellite compositions\nHigh-performance sport equipment\nInfrastructure and civil engineering, , Medical devices and prosthetics, Automotive and aerospace industry, Industrial machinery and equipment, Space and satellite compositions, High-performance sport equipment, Infrastructure and civil engineering.\n\nAdvantages: Lighter than metals, More durable than metals, Higher stiffness than metals, Better tapering due to orthotropic nature of ply, Cheaper than metals."
Stanford University,Pressure as a Second Driving Force to Overcome Diffusion Limitations in Encapsulated Islet Cell Therapy,Docket #: S23-508,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/pressure-second-driving-force-overcome-diffusion-limitations-encapsulated-islet-cell,"Researchers at Stanford have found that applying pressure to macroencapsulation can enhance insulin transport from encapsulated islet beta cells to surrounding tissue and assist in glucose metabolism in type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients.\nT1D is an autoimmune disease in which insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed by the patient's own immune system. The resulting insulin deficiency is most often managed through exogenous insulin administration. This requires frequent or constant blood glucose level monitoring and insulin administration, significantly diminishing the patient's quality of life. Many studies have suggested transplantation of macroencapsulated islet beta cells as a means to achieve insulin independence. The encapsulation can provide a robust barrier against the host immune system. However, it could also impede insulin diffusion from the encapsulation, making it difficult to release insulin at physiological levels.\nStanford researchers have discovered that applying pressure to the macroencapsulation could enhance insulin transport kinetics. A modest pressure equivalent to normal diastolic blood pressure sufficiently improved insulin flux across encapsulating membranes. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that pressure-driven flow is superior to relying solely on diffusion. Transplantation of the pressurized macroencapsulation of beta islets could help T1D patients achieve full insulin independence.\nFigure Caption: Pressure-driven dosing from macroencapsulated islets supporting physiologic insulin dosing in mice\n\nApplications: Cadaveric, donor, or stem cell-derived beta islet transplantation, Artificial pancreas, In vivo cell-based bioelectronics.\n\nAdvantages: Improved transport of islet cells compared to diffusion-based macroencapsulation devices, Complete immunoisolation, Retrievable, Precise temporal regulation of insulin delivery."

Researchers at Stanford have optimized a genome editing method in HSPCs using CRISPR/Cas9 in combination with AAV6-medicated homologous recombination (HR). The Cas9 nuclease and a short guide RNA (sgRNA) were delivered to the target genomic sequence. The double-stranded DNA break made by Cas9 was repaired by HR with a designed donor DNA template in the AAV6 vector that contains the desired genetic modification. Using this new method, researchers were able to achieve highly efficient editing, where both single nucleotide and several kilobases of DNA can be changed.\nThe researchers have applied the method to monogenic diseases, and have developed sgRNA and AAV6 donor DNA sequences that work well in HSPCs for several severe combined immunodeficiency disorders (SCID), including X-linked Chronic Granulomatous Disease (X-CGD) Deficiency.\n\nApplications: Gene editing for treatment of X-linked Chronic Granulomatous Disease (X-CGD) Deficiency, Therapeutic delivery: Safe harbor approach in human CCR5 locus constitutes a flexible platform for delivering therapeutic proteins for other disorders (e.g. metabolic diseases).\n\nAdvantages: Novel: No existing  treatment available for X-linked Chronic Granulomatous Disease (X-CGD) Deficiency, High frequency of success: Genome editing frequencies in human HSPCs higher than previously reported, High specificity and safe: No evidence of abnormal hematopoiesis following transplantation and minimal off-target activity and toxicity were observed, Flexibility: From single nucleotide up to several thousand bases can be modified ex vivo or in vivo."

Stanford University,Stereotactic irradiation for lung volume reduction (SILVR) in severe emphysema,Docket #: S23-549,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/stereotactic-irradiation-lung-volume-reduction-silvr-severe-emphysema,"Stanford researchers have identified an appropriate method and dosage for radiotherapy-based noninvasive lung volume reduction to treat severe emphysema.\nEmphysema is a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease characterized by irreversible damage to the lung's air sacs. Severe emphysema can be treated with lung volume reduction surgery, which involves resection of the affected areas. However, many patients are not candidates for this invasive procedure. An existing less invasive treatment option, bronchoscopic endobronchial valve placement, is often ineffective due to collateral ventilation through damaged airways.\nTo develop an alternative, Stanford researchers have repurposed stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, commonly used to treat acute lung cancer. Irradiation can noninvasively induce scarring in the treated lung tissue, resulting in volume reduction. Through a phase I clinical trial in severe emphysema patients, optimal strategies for radiation dose distribution and patient selection were determined. Stereotactic irradiation for lung volume reduction (SILVR) has the potential to become a noninvasive and efficacious treatment option for patients with severe emphysema.\nStage of Development\nPhase I clinical trial\n\nApplications: Treatment for severe emphysema\n\nFocused emphysematous tissue\nHomogeneous tissue damage across the lung, Focused emphysematous tissue, Homogeneous tissue damage across the lung.\n\nAdvantages: Noninvasive, Efficacious, Uses existing radiotherapy devices and techniques."
Stanford University,Methods and Composition for Targeted Receptor-Mediated Programmable Macromolecule Delivery,Docket #: S23-161,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/methods-and-composition-targeted-receptor-mediated-programmable-macromolecule-delivery,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a novel method for programmable macromolecule delivery via engineered cells, using trogocytosis.\nGenome editing technologies have revolutionized the field of personalized medicine. Despite its initial promise, many of these methods have failed to deliver useful clinical therapeutics. Two commonly used methods, AAV and nanoparticles, lack flexibility in their cellular specificity programming to be widely used in tissue or cell specific diseases. Engineered cells have emerged as promising delivery vehicles, but current engineering methods lack specific and programmable macromolecule delivery. Cells have evolved several methods of direct molecule exchange that have cell type specificity, including trogocytosis. Trogocytosis is favorable because it has been shown to be bidirectional, and it maintains the functional integrity of the transported molecules. However, engineered macromolecule delivery methods have yet to capitalize on this method of cell-to-cell transport.\nStage of Development\nResearch - in vivo\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have created a novel cell engineering strategy (TRANSFER) for the delivery of macromolecules in a cell specific fashion. More specifically, the inventors have harnessed the power of trogocytosis to deliver macromolecules from an engineered cell to another cell in vivo, allowing for targeted delivery while maintaining the functional integrity of the macromolecules being transported. The macromolecules can subsequently be freed from endosomes in recipient cells and optionally functionalized in a trogocytosis-like pH-responsive membrane fusion. This method is fully programmable and allows for tissue and cell specific targeting as well as the delivery of many different macromolecules.\n\nApplications: Programmable and specific delivery of functional molecules into various cell types.\n\nAdvantages: Fully programmable delivery of most macromolecules to tissue specific or cell specific targets, Tunable, efficient, and versatile delivery method."

One application of NGS is assaying the nucleic acid binding or modifying for a single protein interacting with thousands to millions of sequences simultaneously. However, increasing the number of proteins assayed has been difficult, costly, and labor-intensive. In another vein, microfluidics platforms have allowed for the parallel assessment of binding affinities of a several sequences with hundreds of transcription factors (TFs). Microfluidic technology has not yet been leveraged to assay the binding of many TFs to many sequences in parallel.\nStage of Development\nResearch - in vivo\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a novel approach to assay many sequences and many proteins binding affinity at the same time. Specifically, they use a barcode and print approach that links particular members of pooled sequenced libraries to specific protein variants that interact with the particular library members. Briefly, a barcoded library of sequences and a library of proteins that are imprinted at discrete locations to provide a barcode of sorts for the protein variant are created and pooled. These libraries are then put through a microfluidic device separately such that each microfluidic droplet contains one protein variant and one sequence. These are then incubated with a capture agent that binds to variant proteins and the captured sequences bound to the variant proteins are sequenced. This allows for the assessment of many different protein-sequence binding partners in a single assay.\n\nApplications: High throughput assessment of many different protein-sequence interactions in the same assay..\n\nAdvantages: Can produce measurements of 100,000+ protein-sequence interactions in a single day., Reduces costs associated with performing many assays vs one assay with the proposed method.."
Stanford University,High Density Soft Bioeelctronic Fibers,Docket #: S23-326,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/high-density-soft-bioeelctronic-fibers,"Stanford researchers have developed a method for manufacturing high quality multifunctional soft electronic fibers based on conventional microfabrication techniques.\nElectronic fibers, with electronic components integrated into one-dimensional form, present a wide range of opportunities for applications across various fields, from consumer electronics to healthcare and more. Their unique one-dimensional structure allows for more compactness and deformability compared to 2D and 3D systems. Unfortunately, currently available electronic fibers are manufactured through complex processes, such as fiber spinning, 3D printing, microfluidics, and thermal drawing. As a result, they suffer from bulkiness, rigidity, and low density and imprecise positioning of active components.\nStanford researchers have devised a strategy to manufacture high density and versatile electronic fibers by transforming microfabricated 2D films into 1D fibers using spiral transformation. This approach takes advantage of well-established microfabrication techniques developed for planar substrates, simplifying the manufacturing process while giving precise control of positions of the active components. The researchers have demonstrated that centimeter-scale 2D thin films with micro-patterned components can be rolled into micro-scale electronic fibers. They have successfully built and tested electronic fibers for gastrointestinal monitoring/stimulation and neural recording. This new manufacturing method can make electronic fibers more accessible for a wide range of applications.\nFigure Caption: 2D-to-1D transformed fiber\n\nApplications: Probes, Guidewires, Pacemakers, Deep brain stimulation, Neural recording, Smart biopsy needles, Electronic sutures, Electronic textiles, Soft robotics, Wearables, Sensors.\n\nAdvantages: High density, Thin, Flexible, Precise control over the positions of components, Can be multifunctional, Compatible with conventional microfabrication techniques."

However, current iterations of CAR-T cell therapies face limitations in achieving enduring remission against various liquid and solid tumors, primarily stemming from issues like inadequate persistence and the development of T cell exhaustion.\nIn order to enhance CAR T cell efficacy, researchers from Crystal Mackall's group have identified the transcription factor FOXO1 as critical to CAR T cell antitumor potency. Furthermore, they find that overexpression of FOXO1 mediates a memory-like phenotype in CAR T cells, thus identifying an axis through which CAR T cells can be modulated to prevent the development of exhaustion, promote persistence, and enhance adoptive cell therapy in the fight against cancer.\nStage of Development \nResearch:\nIn vivo\n\nApplications: CAR-T therapeutics, TIL therapeutics, TCR T-cell therapeutics, Therapeutics for liquid tumors, Therapeutics for solid tumors.\n\nAdvantages: Longer remission from solid and liquid cancers, Less T-cell exhaustion, Better persistence of T-cell therapeutics."

Blocking the immune signal can be applied in various contexts, such as treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), diabetic nephropathy, and metabolic syndrome among other metabolic diseases.\nObesity is a global issue and commonly associated with conditions such as liver dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. The lack of effective therapeutics, coupled with a predicted 57% of the world population having an obesity-related condition by 2030, necessitates the development of novel treatment options.\nBlocking the immune receptor signal in a fatty liver disease mouse model led to a ~28% decrease in weight and complete removal of abdominal fat over 10 weeks in treated mice     relative to control mice. Additionally, a verified biomarker in the form of a risk allele is available which can be used to quickly and reliably determine if patients are likely to benefit from the treatment. Consequently, blocking agents for the immune receptor have the potential to enhance and complement current treatment options for obesity, such as weight management and GLP-1 agonists, and serve as a broadly useful treatment strategy for patients suffering from obesity-related conditions.\n\nApplications: Treatment of obesity-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and hyperglycemia, Treatment of chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the liver and other organs, Combined treatment with current available options such as weight management and GLP-1 agonists.\n\nAdvantages: Treatment agents can be readily developed (antibodies, peptides, etc.), Biomarker is available to identify patients that will likely benefit from treatment, Flexible dosage and administration."
Stanford University,Quantitative AML patient risk assessment using RNA signatures associated with sensitivity and resistance to immune cell killing,Docket #: S23-017,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/quantitative-aml-patient-risk-assessment-using-rna-signatures-associated-sensitivity-and,"Stanford researchers have discovered RNA signatures that can be used to predict patient outcomes and identify optimal treatments in acute myeloid leukemia.\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common leukemia in adults, with over 20,000 new cases a year in the US and a five-year overall survival rate of only 27%. While reliable methods for predicting patient outcomes in AML could aid clinical decision making by e.g. predicting which patients would benefit from more aggressive treatment, AML risk is currently evaluated by a complex combination of factors including age, patient performance status, cytogenetics, and medical history. This method is unreliable particularly for the 30% of patients that lack genetic abnormalities associated with clinical outcomes.\nTo address this, Stanford researchers discovered transcriptional programs in AML that are associated with either improved or worse patient outcomes. Researchers treated AML patient cells with human immune cells, identifying subsets of AML cells that are either sensitive or resistant to immune cell killing. Immune-resistant AML cells were found to express RNA transcripts associated with poor survival rates in a large database of AML patient transcriptomes. Better and poorer patient outcomes could be predicted from the expression of RNAs associated with sensitivity and resistance to immune cell killing.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept: AML patient cells that are resistant to immune cell killing in vitro express transcripts associated with poorer patient outcomes, while patient cells that are sensitive to immune cell killing express transcripts associated with improved outcomes.\n\nApplications: Molecular diagnostic tests for AML patient risk stratification, Pre-clinical research in AML.\n\nAdvantages: More quantitative and reliable than current methods for patient risk assessment in AML, Easy to implement using established workflows for RNA sequencing or qPCR, Can be performed non-invasively from a peripheral blood sample or from diagnostic bone marrow aspirate (already used to diagnose AML)."

Previous differentiation methods yielded heterogeneous cell populations, with HSC-like cells constituting only a small fraction. Also, the resulting HSC-like cells displayed limited expression of key HSC transcription factors.\nStanford researchers devised a system to differentiate hPSCs into >90% pure HSC-like cells that express transcription factors at levels comparable to human HSCs, by involving a transition through an artery intermediate. The resulting hPSC-derived HSC-like cells can be differentiated into a range of blood and immune cell-types, including myeloid cells, erythroid cells, T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells.

Moreover, existing AI approaches lack interpretability and struggle with spatial resolution limitations, hindering precise analysis of cell types. Hence, prior efforts at automation have been hampered by inefficient manual annotation processes, limiting analysis to few cell types, and yielding suboptimal results.\nTo address these challenges, Stanford researchers have developed an innovative method using mIF imaging to accurately classify cells in H&E-stained images, providing a robust ground truth based on protein markers. This approach enables the identification of diverse cell types with higher accuracy and generates extensive data for training deep learning models. By training on this ground truth, deep learning models outperform existing methods, facilitating precise cell type identification for personalized treatment decisions in precision medicine.

Drug-resistant infections are often difficult to treat because of the presence of persister cells, a subpopulation of bacterial cells that is highly tolerant of traditional antibiotics. Persister cells are dormant, making them less susceptible to many antibiotics, which are designed to kill growing cells. Administration of nanoparticles in combination with one or more antibiotics was found to be highly efficacious in eradicating persister cells and effective against both planktonic bacteria as well as biofilms for a broad range of bacterial species, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The formulations are useful for enhancing the effect of antibiotics as well as reducing the virulence of bacteria.\nStage of Development\nNanoparticles alone or combined with antibiotic were effective in dispersing pre-formed Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, compared to antibiotic alone.

Stanford University,Simplified sequencing library preparation for digested DNA and improvements to cDNA library priming,Docket #: S22-283,Published Application: WO2024073034,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/simplified-sequencing-library-preparation-digested-dna-and-improvements-cdna-library,"The cost of DNA and RNA sequencing have decreased in recent years to aid effective research and clinical applications; however, the labor time and throughput of preparing DNA and RNA sequencing libraries remains a challenge. To address these challenges, inventors at Stanford created a simplified protocol for DNA sequencing library preparation as well as a reinforced primer for improved cDNA library priming.\nThe simplified protocol for DNA sequencing library preparation works by combining the reaction conditions for multiple steps. This protocol produces an amplified sequencing library from fragmented DNA using only a single master mix for a single incubation program in a standard thermal cycler. One application of the invention is called fragmentation at methylated loci and sequencing (FML-seq) and involves only three benchtop steps. Genomic DNA is digested by a methylation-dependent restriction endonuclease. Then, a unique master mix is added that combines reagents for adapter ligation, adapter loop breaking, and indexing PCR. Lastly, a single cleanup without size selection is used to purify the library. Using FML-seq, the inventors have successfully profiled DNA methylation—a crucial epigenetic mark.  Compared to existing DNA methylation profiling methods, the invention enables FML-seq to reduce the risks of error, reagent costs, and especially labor time due to its short protocol. The invention is also suitable for other sequencing targets via the substitution of different enzymes and adapters.\nThe reinforced cDNA library primer* is intended to replace standard oligo(dT) primers. Many RNA sequencing approaches target the recovery of a diverse library of different reverse-transcribed complementary DNA (cDNA) molecules. They often use a short sequence of deoxythymidines (oligo(dT)) as the primer because it hybridizes to the longer tail of adenines (poly(A)) found on almost every mature non-ribosomal RNA. A downside of this approach is that every base sequence in the resulting cDNA library then includes a homopolymer of continuous dT bases, which creates a variety of problems. This invention's optimized, reinforced primer sequence alleviates those problems, reducing loss of the primer's affinity for its poly(A) target, increasing base diversity, and making it less prone to being lost or misread by the sequencer than pure oligo(dT). In optimization experiments, using the reinforced primer increased the proportion of sequence reads passing the sequencer's quality filter from 50%-60% to 80%-90%. The primer was designed by well-established technology and can be synthesized for additional applications from a different design with the same cost and ease.\n*The additional technology mentioned in this abstract refers to Stanford docket no. S22-285\n\nApplications: DNA sequencing library preparation kits for research and clinical use, DNA methylation profiling kits, Genomic sequencing kits, RNA sequencing library preparation kits for research and clinical use, such as for single-cell RNA-seq.\n\nAdvantages: Standardized storage conditions across salt solutions are safe in a standard freezer, simplifying reagent supply chain, More cost-effective and less labor-intensive compared to existing protocols, Reduces errors due to its short single-step program, Increased proportion of sequence reads that pass the sequencer's quality filter, oligo(dT) tends to be used when only a small amount of RNA is available, a specialized niche with fewer competitive products on the market."

Stanford University,Targeting the DSIF Complex as a Therapeutic Method for Interfering with Telomere Lengthening in Cancer Cells,Docket #: S22-392,Published Application: WO2024064192,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/targeting-dsif-complex-therapeutic-method-interfering-telomere-lengthening-cancer-cells,"Inherently, the telomeres located at the ends of chromosomes shorten during each cycle of DNA replication and cell division, eventually  topping DNA replication and leading to cell senescence and death. Cancer cells have unlimited replication potential and evade cell senescence by preventing telomere shortening.  They depend on aberrant expression of the enzyme telomerase for their ability to continue to propagate in their victims.   Consequently, development of anti-cancer therapies that target telomerase has been attempted. However, success of such therapies has been limited, and this has been attributed to  the slowness  of attrition of nucleotide repeat sequences of telomeric DNA, and importantly, to the ability of cancer cells to develop alternative (ALT) methods of telomere elongation. The technology being marketed teaches a novel approach to telomere shortening that is accomplished by preventing RNA transcript elongation on telomeric DNA templates.\nStanford researchers have identified SUPT4H1, a component of DSIF complex as a  target  for  preventing growth of ALT-dependent cancer cells. Inhibiting SUPT4H1's action affects transcription of TERRA, a non-coding RNA synthesized using telomeric DNA as template.  Inhibiting SUPT4H1's actions  reduces the ability of the RNA polymerase to produce TERRA transcripts required by ALT,   leading to telomere shortening (Figure 1) and consequently to cessation of cell division. The SUPT4H1 gene and its partner in formation of the DSIF complex can be inhibited using established gene silencing methods or chemical compounds. Some such compounds have been identified and have been shown to affect the actions of SUPT4H1 and SUPT5H in vitro  and  in vivo.\nFigure\nStage of Development\nIn vitro data\n""""Hit"""" compounds identified\n\nApplications: Treatment of cancers by interference with telomere elongation..\n\nAdvantages: Affects ALT-dependent  telomere elongation, Can be implemented using any of the established gene silencing techniques., No existing competitive product."
Stanford University,Chemokine Receptor Antagonist for Cancer Treatment,Docket #: S22-094,Published Application: WO2024010842,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/chemokine-receptor-antagonist-cancer-treatment,"Stanford researchers have found that a chemokine receptor antagonist can reduce immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment and thereby delay tumor progression.\nImmunotherapy is a cancer treatment approach that modulates the patient's immune system to target and eliminate tumor cells. While it has greatly improved the outlook for patients with liquid tumor cancer, its effectiveness against solid tumors, which account for most cancers, has been relatively low. This is because solid tumor cells release chemokines to their microenvironment to attract certain cells that exert immunosuppressive effects. Accumulation of these cells leads to immunosuppression, tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis – all of which could interfere with cancer treatment. Therefore, removing these cells from the microenvironment could help improve patient prognosis.\nThe Stanford researchers discovered an antagonist that acts on chemokine receptor found on these immunosuppressing cells and showed that such antagonist can delay tumor progression by interfering with recruitment of these immunosuppressing cells. Administration of the antagonist could be a promising treatment option for cancer patients, especially those with immunotherapy-resistant solid tumor, either as a stand-alone therapy or in conjunction with other neoadjuvant therapies. It has shown synergistic effects when combined with immunotherapy and chemotherapy.\nStage of Development\nThe inventors are conducting in vivo experiments to study the therapeutic efficacy in mice with different cancer types.\n\nApplications: Cancer treatment\n\nStand-alone treatment to delay tumor progression\nIn combination with other neoadjuvant therapies (ex.

Traditional techniques like skin prick tests and allergen specific IgE tests, often yield inconclusive and non-specific results. Moreover, the gold standard, Oral Food Challenge is risky and resource intensive. While the existing BAT offers better accuracy, its clinical adoption is hindered by the necessity for fresh blood samples, complex equipment, and skilled personnel. Addressing these challenges is essential for improving accessibility to food allergy diagnosis in routine clinical care.\nStanford researchers have tackled these challenges by developing easyBAT, which simplifies BAT with a user-friendly microfluidic sample preparation device and a fully automated analysis pipeline. This eliminates the need for laboratory equipment or skilled personnel, reducing processing time and expediting diagnosis.

The Noh Lab invention (see figure 1) uses floor-mounted vibration sensors (geophones) to capture floor vibrations generated by footsteps during walking. The data is processed using machine learning algorithms to estimate various gait parameters, including temporal parameters (step, stride, stance, swing time), and spatial parameters (step length, width, angle), as well as health indicators (cadence, left-right symmetry, gait balance, initial contact type), which are important for gait abnormality detection and characterization.\nFigure 1 Gait Analysis via Geophone Sensors\nImage courtesy the Noh Lab\nThis non-intrusive, scalable, and perceived as privacy-friendly gait analysis provides continuous monitoring of an individual's gait parameters and health-related information at home, allowing for early detection of health issues, evaluation of rehabilitation program effectiveness, and timely interventions when needed.\nStage of Development – Proof of Concept\nThe Noh Lab tested a proof-of-concept prototype.

Stanford University,Variant Flow-FISH Technology to Modulate Gene Expression Using Genome Editing,Docket #: S22-375,Published Application: WO2024064761,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/variant-flow-fish-technology-modulate-gene-expression-using-genome-editing,"Stanford researchers have developed a new technology, Variant-FlowFISH, to enable high-throughput, highly sensitive measurements of how variants, introduced via CRISPR, affect gene expression.\nIt is challenging to therapeutically modulate gene expression only in specific cell types to treat disease. One solution would be to reprogram the gene regulatory sequences in the genome, which control gene expression in cell-type specific ways. Stanford researchers have developed a new technology, called Variant Flow-FISH, that efficiently edits the human genome as desired and is also able to measure the effects of the variants on gene expression. The technology involves three steps: pools of edits are introduced into the human genome using CRISPR prime editing, ii) cells are sorted via FACS into 6 bins based on gene expression levels using RNA FlowFISH, iii) DNA sequencing is performed to determine the frequency of edits across the 6 bins and determine the effect of the variants on gene expression.\nStanford inventors have successfully applied the technology to identify specific synthetic sequences that can be introduced into a non-coding regulatory sequence at the PPIF locus, to change expression of the PPIF gene in monocytes, a gene linked to inflammatory bowel disease. Variant Flow-FISH was used to introduce hundreds of noncoding variants into cells in a single experiment and measure each of the variants' effects on the expression of the PPIF gene.\nFigure Description: Schematic of Variant-FlowFISH. Edits are introduced into a pool of cells (e.g. via prime-editing), which are then stained for an RNA of interest and sorted into expression bins. The edited sites are sequenced, and the distribution of variant frequencies across the 6 bins, allows us to infer the effect of each variant.

Stanford University,High-affinity Decoy Cytokines for IL-11 Receptor Super-agonism and Antagonism,Docket #: S23-081,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/high-affinity-decoy-cytokines-il-11-receptor-super-agonism-and-antagonism,"Stanford researchers have developed a high-affinity IL-11 decoy cytokine for super-agonism and antagonism of the IL-11 receptor, enabling the treatment of a wide variety of diseases from inflammatory disease to cancer as well as research into IL-11 signaling pathways.\nInterleukin-11 (IL-11) signaling plays a significant role in many diseases through its roles in inflammation, tissue repair, and cancer progression. For example, IL-11 blocking antibodies are in clinical development for pulmonary fibrosis while wild-type IL-11 is approved as a treatment for thrombocytopenia. However, stronger binders to the IL-11 receptor have the potential to be more effective treatments.\nStanford researchers therefore developed an IL-11 decoy cytokine with much higher affinity for the IL-11 receptor than the wild-type cytokine. High-throughput combinatorial screening identified mutations to IL-11 that increased its binding affinity to the IL-11 receptor 70-fold. Rresearchers identified additional mutations that converted this super-agonist to an antagonist by ablating binding to the gp130 co-receptor. Finally, they identified other mutations that enabled high-affinity binding to the mouse IL-11 receptor (~10-fold over wildtype) without affecting human IL-11 receptor binding. This engineered cytokine slows the growth of tumors in a mouse model of non-small cell lung cancer.\nStage of Development\nIn vivo: In mouse models of non-small cell lung cancer, treatment with the engineered cytokine slowed tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner\n\nApplications: IL-11 antagonists, for the treatment of e.g. cancer, inflammatory disease, and fibrotic disease, IL-11 agonists, for the treatment of e.g. thrombocytopenia, Research in IL-11 signaling.\n\nAdvantages: Highly specific for the IL-11 receptor, High affinity binding to the human IL-11 receptor (~70-fold higher than endogenous IL-11), High affinity binding to the mouse IL-11 receptor (~10-fold higher than endogenous mouse IL-11) to enable research in mouse models, Small size allows for diffusion into tumors (~19 kDa cytokine vs ~150 kDa antibodies)."
Stanford University,Organoid Microfluidic Chip for Psychotropic medication side effect prediction,Docket #: S23-112,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/organoid-microfluidic-chip-psychotropic-medication-side-effect-prediction,"Pharmacologic agents are commonly used to treat psychiatric diseases. These compounds, however, react differently across patients, are often followed by negative side effects and can have varied efficacy timeframes. Unfortunately, determining the efficacy and side-effect profile for therapeutics can be a time-consuming and costly process. To circumvent this issue, inventors at Stanford have designed a solution to analyze patient-specific drug responses by integrating organoids within a microfluidic chip for tissue culture and high-throughput screening. Microfluidics allows precision control of fluid flow to determine parameters like nutrient delivery, mechanical stimulus, and drug delivery at the microscale level, all by using a thousand-fold smaller volume of materials compared to standard plate assays. Using the chip, users can measure how drugs of interest would act in the patient's body by using a small skin sample. As a proof of concept, the inventors utilized the platform to model antidepressant effects on the gut-brain axis. The system seeds gut organoids with patient-representative gut microbiota onto a microfluidic chip, through which the drugs can be run through. Then, the inventors measured serotonin concentration as an output indicative of gut serotonin production over the course of treatment with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). The output provided a snapshot into how different SSRIs affect the gut microbiome and gut serotonin production on a patient-specific basis, while laying the foundation for understanding variability in treatment response. Overall, the platform enables a high accuracy, high throughput, patient-centered approach for screening drug responses that increases the potential for positive therapeutic outcomes.\n\nApplications: Precision medicine, High-throughput screening assay for therapeutic compounds, Microfluidic device.\n\nAdvantages: Predicts side effect profiles for psychiatric medications, High-throughput, low-cost assay with microfluidics, Customizable to patients with skin sample."
Stanford University,Pioneering Targeted Gene Therapy for Treatment of Glaucoma and Inner Retinal Disorders,Docket #: S23-196,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/pioneering-targeted-gene-therapy-treatment-glaucoma-and-inner-retinal-disorders,"Stanford researchers have developed a pioneering gene therapy by targeting reactive astrocytes in the optic nerve head (ONH) and modulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels for targeted treatment of glaucoma and other retinal disorders.\nDespite the increasing prevalence of retinal disorders like glaucoma in the US, effective targeted therapies for afflicted patients are scarce. Current treatments, such as eye drops, merely aim to slow disease progression without addressing the root cause. Despite the pivotal role of ONH astrocytes driving the pathogenesis of glaucoma and various optic neuropathies, there is a lack of therapeutic methods targeting this cell population in retinal disorders. Addressing this gap is crucial for developing effective targeted treatments for irreversible conditions like glaucoma and other retinal disorders.\nStanford researchers have filled this critical gap by pioneering a gene therapy solution targeting reactive astrocytes in the optic nerve for the treatment of glaucoma and other inner retinal disorders. These astrocytes, when injured, differentiate into either protective or harmful reactive astrocytes, which are controlled by cAMP. This invention specifically modulates the cAMP levels, either by increasing nuclear or depleting cytosolic cAMP, promoting the proliferation of protective astrocytes, and inhibiting harmful ones, ultimately aiding in retinal ganglion cell survival after optic nerve injury in glaucoma. By targeting specific reactive astrocyte populations and modulating compartmented cAMP, this invention marks a significant advancement in targeted gene therapy and holds promise for treating glaucoma and other inner retinal disorders.\nStage of Development:\nPre-clinical. Next steps involve continued testing in preclinical models of glaucoma, followed by large animal proof-of-concept and toxicology studies.\n\nApplications: Targeted gene therapy for glaucoma and other inner retinal disorders, Treatment of optic neuropathies, Prophylaxis of CNS disorders, Gliotherapeutics..\n\nAdvantages: No available gene therapies for glaucoma and other optic neuropathies, No therapeutic methods that target optic nerve head astrocytes for the treatment of glaucoma and inner retinal disorders."

Abdominal adhesions are fibrotic scars that form between abdominal organs and occur in 50-90% of abdominal operations. Their work shows that the formulation prevents adhesion and does not hinder healing at the site of surgery. There are currently no effective standard-of-care anti-adhesion treatments for abdominal adhesion, therefore, this has the potential to immensely improve clinical care.\nAdhesions occur post-operatively in 50- 90% of all open abdominal operations, representing an enormous clinical problem impacting hundreds of millions of patients worldwide. Currently, there is no standard-of-care treatment to prevent adhesions which can cause bowel obstruction, chronic pain, and/or infertility. T-5224 is a small molecule inhibitor of the Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex, and local application of the drug has previously been shown to prevent abdominal adhesion. But, a practical and effective delivery method of the drug has not been developed for clinical use.\nUsing a mouse and porcine model of abdominal adhesions, the researchers found the hydrogel formulation promotes sustained release of T-5224 and inhibits adhesion formation in vivo. Importantly, no negative side effects were observed. Consequently, sustained release of AP-1 inhibitors to the surgical site has the potential to drastically improve post-surgical outcomes by eliminating abdominal adhesion in patients.\nStage of Development:\n\nApplications: Prevention of abdominal adhesions in patients following surgical operations or intra-abdominal infection, Treatment of other peritoneal diseases related to fibrosis (e.g., peritoneal carcinomatosis), Fibrosis elsewhere in the body (e.g., prevention of pleural or pericardial fibrosis in the context of surgical procedures in the chest or prevention of adhesions after tendon repairs).\n\nAdvantages: These findings represent a topical formulation for an effective anti-adhesion treatment, No effective standard-of-care anti-adhesion therapies exist, Potential significant advancement in the prevention of abdominal adhesions."
Stanford University,"Low-cost, Comprehensive Methylation Profiling Using Low DNA Inputs for Cancer Diagnostics",Docket #: S23-456,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/low-cost-comprehensive-methylation-profiling-using-low-dna-inputs-cancer-diagnostics,"Stanford researchers have developed a new, low-cost method for tumor methylation profiling that enables tumor classification even from low amounts of fragmented DNA characteristic of liquid biopsies.\nMethylation profiling has emerged as a critical tool in the diagnosis and classification of cancer. The abnormal patterns of gene methylation found in cancer cells can enable early diagnosis, cancer type classification, prognosis assessment, and treatment monitoring. However, available methods for classifying methylation status are lacking. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing is prohibitively costly, while methylation arrays are limited by a requirement for high amounts of input DNA and poor overlap with cell-type markers critical for tumor classification. Other methods are also not suited for the fragmented DNA and low tumor cellularity found in many biopsies.\nStanford researchers therefore developed a new method for methylation classification (""""XR-methylseq"""") that is low cost, unbiased, enables tumor type classification, and suitable for low, fragmented DNA inputs (down to 250 pg). DNA fragments are ligated to an adapter, digested with a restriction enzyme at CCGG motifs, and ligated to a second adapter. Fragments are enzymatically converted to distinguish methylation status and only fragments with both adapters are amplified and sequenced. Researchers demonstrated that this technique can accurately classify CNS tumors from CSF, which is not possible using other methods due to the low DNA content and tumor cellularity found in CSF.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept: XR-methylseq enables tumor classification from CSF\n\nApplications: Analysis of both solid and liquid biopsies (e.g., urine, CSF, biopsy supernatant), Diagnosis and classification of cancer, Early cancer detection, Prediction of cancer prognosis, Personalized cancer treatment, Minimal residual disease testing, Monitoring of treatment response and resistance, Basic research into methylation profiles.\n\nAdvantages: Overlaps with cell type markers to enable tumor classification, Uses enzymatic digestion instead of harsh bisulfite chemistries that break DNA, Works with low DNA inputs (250 pg) and low tumor cellularity, Low cost, Works with fragmented DNA often seen in biopsies, Highly correlated with WGBS gold standard (not biased), 95%+ on-target rate, leading to an 18-fold enrichment at CCGG flanks."

They optimize the transfer of signals between components, ensuring efficient power transfer and minimizing signal distortion. However, conventional tunable matching networks that use passive components are bulky and suffer from slow transient responses. Meanwhile, recently developed tunable matching networks that use passive components and active semiconductor switches are complex and costly.\nStanford researchers therefore developed a new design for tunable matching networks that are compact, fast, low-cost, robust, and simple to control.

This software can make clinical identification and assessment of fibrotic diseases more precise, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes.\nFibrosis represents a major cause of morbidity worldwide and can involve a wide variety of organs and tissues. It is estimated that 45% of deaths in the United States are attributable to major-organ fibrosis (e.g., myocardial infarct, stroke, liver cirrhosis), fibroproliferative disorders (e.g., scleroderma, myelofibrosis), and scarring associated with trauma. Clinicians and pathologists diagnose and stage these diseases using visual observation, leaving room for physician bias and the inability to capture subtle clinical progression. The Longaker lab has developed a machine learning algorithm that can digitally analyze and classify patient samples. This approach is highly sensitive and can avoid biases inherent with human observation. In addition, it can more accurately track and recognize changes in disease progression. The algorithm identifies a variety of properties relevant to fibrosis, including the appearance of extracellular matrix fibers and branchpoints, and fiber length and width. This technology has the potential to greatly improve patient outcomes and streamline disease classification and tracking.\n\nApplications: Pathological and clinical assessment of fibroses, including: scarring, systemic sclerosis, myelofibrosis, and cirrhosis, Early identification of fibrotic diseases, Precise, objective quantification of fibrotic diseases.\n\nAdvantages: Removes physician bias in diagnosis and staging of disease, Rapid quantification and scoring of fibrotic samples, Can capture the spatial and morphological complexity of the disease in question."
Stanford University,Use of Verteporfin for Prevention of Skin Scarring,Docket #: S19-318,Published Application: WO2021021607,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/use-verteporfin-prevention-skin-scarring,"The Longaker lab at Stanford University has recently discovered that local injection of the drug Verteporfin after wounding can reduce scarring, improve the strength of healed skin, and regrow the hair follicles and sweat glands that are usually lost during the scarring process. Verteporfin has the potential to prevent millions of patients around the world from suffering with large, distressing scars.\nHundreds of millions of patients worldwide develop new scars every year, and scars and their associated problems cost the United States over $20 billion every year. Despite the high demand for scar treatments, there is currently no drug on the market that can successfully prevent or reverse scarring. The Longaker lab has uncovered the cell signaling process that results in scarring and have found that the FDA approved drug Verteporfin can dramatically reduce scarring and improve wound appearance when injected directly after wounding. When wounded mice were injected with Verteporfin, their healed connective tissue was stronger than scarred skin and their healed skin closely resembled healthy, unwounded skin. Further, while typical scarred skin lacks hair follicles and sweat glands, Verteporfin allowed the regrowth of these very important skin elements.\nWhile the Longaker lab knows that Verteporfin has the potential to dramatically improve scarring of wounded skin, they also postulate that this treatment could have positive effects on other fibrotic processes present in other areas of the body. Given that Verteporfin is already FDA approved as an injectable, this drug is already known to be clinically safe.\nStage of Development\nProof of Concept\n\nApplications: Treatment of incisions that normally result in large scars, Potentially applicable to other fibroses of skin and body.\n\nAdvantages: Improved scarring outcomes: reduced scarring, stronger healed skin, improved scar appearance, Regrowth of skin elements, including: hair follicles, sweat glands, Can be administered close to time of surgery."

Despite a plethora of clinical options and an enormous consumer market for scar treatment; no current therapeutic strategy prevents or reverses this fibrotic process. Inventors at Stanford developed a novel method of use of Piezo1 and Piezo2 inhibitors in the prevention of skin scarring. Piezo channels are mechanosensitive ion channels that mediate stretch sensation. Piezo1 and Piezo2 inhibitors inhibit cellular mechanical signaling, an important contributor to scarring and fibrosis. Using a mouse model of wound healing, we find that a single dose of piezo1 or piezo2 treatment (local injection) reduces scarring and fibrosis, specifically via adipocytes as they are mechanically sensitive. Aside from physically offloading wound tension through specialized wound dressings, no effective therapy for skin scarring exists. No targeted molecular agents have been able to reduce scar burden while not comprising or delaying wound repair. The novel method not only reduces scarring, but also improves scar appearance and allows for regrowth of skin elements such as hair follicles and sweat glands (absent in scars), which are highly significant outcomes for patients suffering from skin scarring.\n\nApplications: Scar prevention in the skin, Inhibition of mechanical sensing in adipocytes, Treatment of organ fibrosis.\n\nAdvantages: Currently, there is no effective drug that can overcome skin fibrosis in the skin.

No disease-modifying drugs exist, making major joint replacement surgery the only viable long-term solution. A critical hindrance to developing disease-modifying drugs for osteoarthritis is its usual late detection in patients, making it challenging to reverse disease pathogenesis.\nImmune cell involvement in OA pathogenesis has been identified, but the specific cell types involved, their spatiotemporal dynamics in disease, and cellular crosstalk that results in joint degeneration have not been extensively studied. Studying the peripheral blood of patients is a low-cost, accessible way to gain insight into the OA immune landscape.\nStanford researchers identified differentially abundant immune populations in OA peripheral blood using mass cytometry (CyTOF) and deployed machine learning to identify OA immune signatures.

Binding moieties expressed on viruses and virus-like system can target desired specific cell types and bind off-the-shelf or custom antibodies in a plug-and-play manner.\nCell and gene therapies rely on successful delivery of therapeutic genetic payloads to specific cells or tissues. Retroviruses are used to directly integrate genetic payloads into the target cell for long-term, heritable, and stable expression of the gene. A major challenge in the field remains highly selective transduction to specific cell types. Stanford researchers have addressed the selectivity problem by developing a retrovirus that is decorated by a binding moiety that either directly binds the cell of interest through a cell binding domain (CBD) or binds an antibody/antibody fragment/ligand (ABD) that then binds the cell. The system is expandable to virus-like particles (VLPs).\nFigure\nFigure description: A) Universal retroviruses are created by engineering the envelope or packaging plasmid with a binding moiety (envelope version shown).

C) The binding moiety can contain either a cell binding domain (CBD, top) or an antibody/antibody-fragment/ligand binding domain (ABD, bottom). In the CBD case, the binding moiety directs the virus toward a very specific protein, enabling it to transduce the cell type.

Stanford University,Predicting Gestational Age and Time to Delivery in Pregnant Women,Docket #: S20-384,Published Application: 20220142477,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/predicting-gestational-age-and-time-delivery-pregnant-women,"Researchers at Stanford have developed computational modeling methods for improved prediction of gestational age and time to delivery. This work is based on the identification of blood metabolites in pregnant women that can accurately predict gestational age and provide insights into pregnancy variations undetected by ultrasound (currently the most accurate timing method for pregnancy). In the new method, a computational model, trained using temporally aligned analyte measurements derived from a cohort of pregnant individuals, is used to assess metabolite data sampled from a pregnant subject over one or more time points. This approach aligns temporal data to evaluate gestational age, time to labor, preterm birth, and preterm abortion including diagnostics to be utilized for clinical interventions.  Accurate estimation of the timing of pregnancy and birth is important for many clinical decisions in obstetrics, including determination of preterm birth and related treatment regimens. However, current clinical methods are based on information about the last menstruation date, which can be imprecise, or ultrasound imaging, which depends on accessibility at early pregnancy. Moreover, the accuracy of ultrasound for estimating gestational age is suboptimal, with only 40% of the newborns delivered within 7 days of the predicted due dates.\nStage of Development\nA recent study by the researchers demonstrated that the development of clinical tools with a few metabolites in maternal blood to time pregnancy is promising. Testing of blood drawn from the pregnant woman would likely be limited to once or a few times to be informative and have the potential to benefit pregnant women in both the developed and developing worlds.\n\nApplications: Predicting gestational age and delivery.\n\nAdvantages: Accuracy is significantly improved compared to prior technology using blood metabolites, There is a great need for accurate timing of pregnancy: in the U.S. alone, 900,000 women annually missed their first-trimester ultrasound."

Consequently, immunotherapeutics have gradually gained a strong foothold in the pharmaceutical industry. Despite this, the long-term efficacy and side effects of immunotherapies, such as CAR T cells, can be precarious, hindering their wider adoption.\nNow, researchers at Stanford have developed technologies with tremendous potential to overcome one common side effect of these therapies, T cell exhaustion. They identified a new class of small molecules that potently and transiently inhibit T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine secretion. This prevented and reversed T cell exhaustion, a common side effect of immunotherapies, in mouse models. Additionally, these compounds can be administered with various genetically engineered T cells, demonstrating a wide range of potential applications.

Immunotherapy using CAR-T cells relies on T cell receptor (TCR) signaling to activate the cells that will mediate potent antitumor or anti-infective effects. However, over time, chronic signaling through the endogenous TCR or CAR can induce a dysfunctional state called """"T cell exhaustion"""", reducing the overall effectiveness of therapy. Moreover, CARs are prone to antigen independent signaling in vitro and in vivo, further underscoring the need to modulate CAR signaling to preserve CAR T function.  The inventors utilized small molecules to inhibit protein kinases and address this overstimulation problem. Since proximal kinases are necessary to transmit TCR and CAR signaling, modulating their effects in a rational manner can enhance CAR-T cell function. This approach could be used in vivo or ex vivo to expand genetically engineered T cells that are less exhausted and therefore more potent. This reversible """"CAR-T switch"""" system transiently inhibits TCR or CAR signaling to prevent or reverse T cell exhaustion and restore T cell function, with applications in basic research or immunotherapy for infectious disease or cancer.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors initially used a known, FDA-approved drug to demonstrate the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on reversing T cell exhaustion and augmenting T cell function in vivo. Further studies and collaborations with additional Stanford researchers have demonstrated similar effects using different, novel compounds (further described in Stanford Docket S18-061: Small Molecule modulators of chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) T cells).\nCAR-T cells expanded ex vivo in the presence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors maintained a memory-like phenotype, which is associated with improved clinical responses in patients. When these cells were infused into mice, they: a) demonstrated profoundly augmented proliferative capacity and persistence in vivo and b) exhibited durable control of leukemia or osteosarcoma compared to CAR-T cells expanded in the absence of the inhibitors.\n\nApplications: Immunotherapy - Prevent or reverse T cell exhaustion in cell therapy for cancer or chronic infection for:\n\nEx vivo expansion of engineered CAR-T cells\nIn vivo modulation of CAR or T cell receptor signaling, Ex vivo expansion of engineered CAR-T cells, In vivo modulation of CAR or T cell receptor signaling, Research – methods using protein kinase inhibitors could be used to study basic T cell function and signaling.\n\nAdvantages: Enhanced CAR-T immunotherapy:\n\nPreventing or reversing T cell exhaustion could improve effectiveness of immunotherapy for cancer or chronic infections\nCould improve cytotoxicity, proliferative capacity and/or cytokine secretion, Preventing or reversing T cell exhaustion could improve effectiveness of immunotherapy for cancer or chronic infections, Could improve cytotoxicity, proliferative capacity and/or cytokine secretion, Transient effects – Transient and reversible effects on CAR and T cell receptor signaling, providing a mechanism for T cells to """"rest"""" and maintain or restore functionality, Direct modulation - addresses root cause of T cell exhaustion (i.e., continuous TCR signaling) instead of relying on accessory pathways (such as PD-1/PD-L1)."
Stanford University,Single-molecule Peptide Sequencing Enabled by Intramolecular DNA Encoded Edman Degradation,Docket #: S22-476,Published Application: WO2024178395,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/single-molecule-peptide-sequencing-enabled-intramolecular-dna-encoded-edman-degradation,"Stanford researchers have developed a next-generation protein sequencing platform capable of identifying all the proteins in a cell at single amino acid resolution.\nMethods for single-cell RNA and DNA sequencing have revolutionized science and medicine. However, genetic data poorly reports on the proteins in a cell, as post-transcriptional modifications critical to cellular function (e.g., protein phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination) are not encoded in mRNA, and mRNA levels are often poorly predictive of protein levels. Despite this, robust methods for identifying and quantifying the proteins in a cell are lacking. Current mass spectrometry approaches can only identify a small fraction of all the proteins in a cell, while emerging approaches such as nanopore and real-time dynamic protein sequencing suffer from poor generalizability, throughput, and sensitivity.\nResearchers therefore developed a new protein sequencing method that combines the well-established technologies of Edman degradation and high-throughput DNA sequencing. Briefly, one amino acid at a time is removed from the end of each protein and barcoded with DNA that are specific to the protein molecule. The DNA barcoded amino acid derivatives are recognized by an antibody specific for that amino acid. Importantly, such antibodies can also recognize specific post-translational modifications. DNA barcodes associated with each antibody encode the identity of the amino acid, the protein it came from, and its location in the protein. DNA sequencing of these barcodes then reveals the amino acid sequence of each protein. Critically, signal amplification during DNA sequencing allows for high sensitivity.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept: development of Edman degradation conditions compatible with DNA and DNA-barcoded antibodies specific for certain amino acids (including post-transcriptionally modified amino acids)\n\nApplications: Single-cell de novo protein sequencing at single-molecule resolution, High throughput database-assisted single-cell protein identification, Basic proteomics research, Diagnostics (e.g., detection of aberrant proteins such as beta-amyloid variants in Alzheimer's disease), Target discovery, Drug development (e.g., targeted protein degradation, de-ubiquitination, phosphorylation, etc).\n\nAdvantages: Combines the well-established methods of Edman degradation and high throughput sequencing, Potential to sequence all the proteins in a single cell at single molecule resolution, High sensitivity, High throughput, Can identify any arbitrary protein sequence, Can detect post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, glycosylation, methylation, acetylation, etc.)."

They have also developed a precision medicine platform for identifying novel therapeutic leads that lower oxidative stress and selecting which patients may benefit most from these leads.\nMore than 65 million individuals worldwide are estimated to have Long COVID (LC), where patients often report fatigue and other symptoms resembling myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Currently, there are no treatments or reliable diagnostic markers for fatigue. To address this gap in knowledge, Stanford researchers analyzed blood samples from individuals with fatigue syndromes, including LC, ME-CFS, and lupus patients, to successfully identify a common molecular signature of elevated oxidative stress in cells. Diagnostic analysis for fatigue can then be performed with one or more of flow cytometry, RNA-seq analysis, mass spectrometry, and systems chemistry analysis.\nFurthermore, the developed assays can identify specific drugs that can redress or lower oxidative stress in cells. Using this platform, Stanford researchers have successfully identified several FDA-approved drugs that can lower oxidative stress in cells.\nStage of Development \nIn vitro: Strong signal to noise ratio in assays\n\nApplications: Molecular diagnostic for ME-CFS and Long COVID, Quantitative diagnostic for fatigue, Identifying novel therapeutic leads for fatigue based conditions.\n\nAdvantages: First quantitative diagnostic for fatigue, First identified treatment for Long COVID or ME-CFS, Precision medicine approach, Non-invasive."

However, cancer cells also shed RNA into the blood. Analyzing this cell-free RNA could enable much more thorough characterization of cancer than DNA, as RNA reports on gene expression patterns that vary widely between cancer types and can inform cancer progression.\nTo better enable cancer diagnosis, classification, staging, and early detection, Stanford researchers therefore developed a highly sensitive and specific method for analyzing cell-free cancer RNA. Researchers extensively optimized methods for blood collection, plasma separation, cell-free RNA purification, and library preparation. They designed a custom panel of 5,546 genes to identify and classify cancer with high sensitivity. They showed that this method could diagnose a wide range of cancers from patient blood samples with sensitivities of 66-100%, including non-small cell lung cancer and prostate cancer. It also could distinguish histological subtypes and differentiate cancer from other, non-malignant conditions.\nStage of Development\nPreclinical: detection of NSCLC (73.7% sensitivity), SCLC (66.7% sensitivity), PAAD (80% sensitivity), PRAD (77.8% sensitivity), LIHC (100% sensitivity).\n\nApplications: Cancer diagnosis, classification, and staging, Early detection of cancer, Personalized cancer treatment, Companion diagnostics for cancer treatment, Monitoring of treatment response and resistance, Development of new treatments for cancer, Identification of cancer driver and resistance mutations, Non-invasive research into cancer transcriptomics, Classification of noncancerous cells in the tumor microenvironment (tumor-associated macrophages, etc.)..\n\nAdvantages: Non-invasive testing, cfRNA enables more thorough molecular characterization than cfDNA, Low limit of detection (~0.01%), High sensitivity (67%-100%, depending on tumor type), High specificity."

This method will ensure improved interventions and treatment outcomes.\nPostoperative cognitive decline (POCD), defined as cognitive impairment arising after surgery, is a common clinical problem that occurs in 10-54% of patients within the first few weeks following surgery and can persist for several months and years. POCD affects patients of all ages but is more common in older people. A recent study reported that 28.5% of people over 60 develop POCD upon discharge. Predicting the risk of developing POCD would improve interventions and patient care.\nTherefore, Stanford researchers developed a method that assesses patient risk for POCD after surgery that involves:\n1.	Quantifying protein activity of multiple immune cell subsets in peripheral blood using fluorescence flow or mass cytometry.\n2.	Quantifying plasma proteins using an antibody-based or aptamer-based technology.\n3.

These floorplate organoids can be fused with spinal cord organoids to form midline assemboids to induce specific cell fate and cell-cell interactions at the interface.\nOrganizer cell populations are crucial to neurodevelopment as they control spatial patterning and neural connectivity by establishing signaling gradients of guidance molecules. Disruptions in organizer cell type function can lead to neuropsychiatric disorders. Due to the lack of access to neural tissues, the investigation of human organizers is limited. Currently, there is no in vitro generated three-dimensional floorplate organoid described to date.\nThis first-time generation of functional neural organizers from hiPS cells brings new opportunities in biological investigation of human organizers and neurodevelopment.

By combining this surgery technique with targeted delivery of specific growth factors (e.g. BMP2 and VEGFR1) to the site of tissue degeneration, they were able to stimulate skeletal stem cells to regenerate cartilage. This process involves both mechanical stimulation from the surgery and biochemical stimulation from the growth factors to encourage stem cells to transform into cartilage.\nOsteoarthritis is a degenerative disease that results in irreversible and progressive loss of cartilage lining joints and is the most common form of musculoskeletal disorder. Currently, surgeons commonly use the microfracture surgery technique in an attempt to regenerate cartilage in osteoarthritis. But, although the surgery results in 'fibrocartilage' that provides some symptomatic relief, the mechanical properties compared with normal articular cartilage are significantly reduced. Concurrently, BMP2 has been shown to be a potent bone growth factor and inhibition of VEGF signaling has been shown to reduce osteoarthritis progression and fibrosis in vivo. A combination therapy using both mechanical and biochemical stimulation at the site of tissue degeneration can be a powerful approach to treating osteoarthritis.\nConcomitant microfracture surgery and delivery of BMP2 and VEGFR1 results in robust and stable regeneration of cartilage in models of osteoarthritis. Importantly, these findings were validated in both mouse and human tissues using pure, functionally defined skeletal stem cells. Consequently, growth-factor-enhanced microfracture surgery can serve as a first-in-class treatment for patients suffering from osteoarthritis.\nStage of Development:\nPreclinical – in vivo (xenograft) data\n\nApplications: Treatment of osetoarthritis and focal chondral defects in joints, Cartilage formation in the craniofacial skeleton.\n\nAdvantages: Cell-specific mechanism, Robust and stable cartilage formation, Reduction in fibrosis."
Stanford University,Quantification of Antigen Molecules Without Calibrators Using Dynamic Flow Cytometry,Docket #: S15-009,"Published Application: 20160238597, Issued: 10,379,118 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/quantification-antigen-molecules-without-calibrators-using-dynamic-flow-cytometry,"Researchers in the Herzenberg laboratory at Stanford University have patented a method to quantify antigens during flow cytometry without the use of calibrators.  Traditional methods for estimating the number of antigens on a cell are based on the detection of target antigens bound with fluorescently labeled antibodies.  A calibration procedure is then used to convert the intensity of the fluorescence signal to the number of target antigens.  Current commercial calibration methods are limited.  Results can vary based on the choice of calibrator, fluorochrome conjugates and sample handling.  In addition, these methods are not applicable to labeling with lower affinity antibodies or labeling under non-equilibrium conditions.  To overcome these limitations the inventors developed this method for antigen quantification which, instead of using a static calibration system, quantifies the antigen molecules per cell by determining the binding rate constant for each antibody-antigen reaction.  This method can be applied to both low and high affinity antibodies, under saturating and non-saturating conditions independent of the conjugated fluorochrome.\nStage of Development\nProof of Concept: The inventors demonstrated the applicability of this method by quantifying the CD8α antigen concentration on human T cells.\n\nApplications: Quantitative flow cytometry analysis, including use in:\n\nImmunology\nClinical diagnostics, Immunology, Clinical diagnostics.\n\nAdvantages: Does not require calibrators- approach is independent of specially prepared calibration beads, antibody regents and dyes, Can be applied to both high and low affinity antibodies, Can be used under both saturating and non-saturating conditions, Allows comparison across flow cytometry instruments and experiments."

The molecule naturally exists in a monomeric form, which impedes easy detection of T cells due to their weak equilibrium dissociation with the lymphocyte. To overcome this limitation, inventors at Stanford have developed a flexible pMHC display system on a self-assembling protein scaffold. Termed a spheromer, the platform has high compatibility with currently available pMHC molecules and streptavidin reagents that are routinely used for T cell analysis. Due to its increased  specificity and sensitivity, the pMHC-spheromer platform overcomes the current limitations of existing T cell detection platforms. The platform is a valuable tool that can be used for the detection, isolation, and activation of antigen-specific T cells, enabling the successful tracking and modulation of the adaptive immune response.\nStage of Development – Research in vitro\n\nApplications: Detection and quantitation of disease-relevant T-cells, Disease tracking, such as immunity in vaccinated individuals, Induction of antigen-specific immunological tolerance to treat autoimmune conditions.\n\nAdvantages: Greater detection efficiency than any commonly used pMHC multimer reagents, Customizable system enabling addition of co-stimulator molecules, Modulation of anti-tumor/anti-viral immunity by inducing antigen-specific responses."

The approach demonstrates significant promise in treating dilated cardiomyopathy, offering a potential cure for a condition with limited therapeutic options.\nDilated cardiomyopathy presents a significant challenge due to its prevalence and lack of effective treatments, making heart transplantation the only current option. Although there are heritable mutations, amenable to CRISPR-based gene therapy, challenges related to delivery of the editing complex and off-target concerns hamper the broad applicability of CRISPR agents in the heart. Stanford researchers have developed a solution by utilizing AAVMYO for precise delivery to heart muscle tissue and CRISPR base editors to correct heritable mutations in the Rbm20 gene. The technology achieves a remarkable repair rate, and has demonstrated efficacy in restoring normal cardiac function in mouse models.\nStage of Development\nIn vivo: researchers have repaired >70% of cardiomyocytes in two Rbm20 knock-in mouse models. Three months after injection, cardiac dilation and ejection fraction reach wild-type levels.

When the researchers tried to combine them with the hope to enhance antitumor activity, they observed macrophage-mediated clearance of the adoptive T cells because the anti-CD47 agent also recognized the CD47 marker on these T cells.\nTo overcome this challenge, these researchers engineered a variant of CD47 that allows retained """"don't eat me"""" signals on T-cells but ablates the therapeutic CD47 antibody binding. CAR-T or TCR-T cells expressing this CD47 variant were resistant to clearance by macrophages when combined with anti-CD47 antibody and resulted in synergistic enhancement in antitumor efficacy. By allowing for the combination of these two different immunotherapies, this work provides a path to immunotherapy that takes advantage of the immune system to deliver superior tumor-type agnostic control.\nStage of Development \nResearch: in vivo\nRelated Technology:\nS21-084: Methods to improve CAR T cell efficacy and safety by modulating mediators of phagocytosis\n\nApplications: Tumor agnostic immunotherapies, Combining anti-CD47 therapy with CAR T or TCR T cell therapies.\n\nAdvantages: Superior efficacy to existing treatments, Allows targeting of solid tumors, Combines innate and adaptive immune responses in cancer therapies, removing pathways of tumor resistance."

Currently, there is no minimally-invasive deliverable therapeutic that could be administered to stop or reverse the adverse effects of myocardial ischemia, much less the associated immune response that results in further deterioration of cardiac function and reverse remodeling of the ventricles.\nThe Woo and Lim labs at Stanford have invented a method that leverages inhibitory immune checkpoint expressions to reduce collateral damage caused by myocardial infarctions. The invention utilizes programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) to protect against autoimmunity from immune cells. When PD-L1 was delivered immediately intramyocardially following a heart attack in a rodent model, the left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly improved compared to control animals who did not receive PD-L1 treatment. PD-L1 when delivered systemically was found to have similar beneficial impact on heart function. Regardless of the dose and delivery route, the method significantly reduced left ventricular infarction size compared to controls without treatment. This invention has the potential to be a valuable tool to preserving cardiac function and significantly enhancing patient outcomes.\n\nApplications: Therapeutic, especially for cardiology, Autoimmunity, Cell signaling research tool.\n\nAdvantages: There is currently no effective therapeutics that can be delivered via a minimally invasive method to preserve cardiac function following myocardial infarctions, Easily delivered to patients, Effective at varying doses and delivery routes."

Current methods by manually or automatically selecting regions of images lead to high-variance or noisy perfusion maps that may be unreliable for detecting abnormal blood flow in the brain. The invention enables reliable automated generation of perfusion maps, using a supervised deep learning algorithm, that takes 3D CT perfusion images as an input and returns time-resolved perfusion maps. The invention is comprised of a neural net trained to reduce image artifacts, deep learning of temporal information embedded in the images, and deep learning of spatial distribution of image features.

Newborn babies face a high risk of blood infections (sepsis) and gastrointestinal inflammation and injury disease (necrotizing enterocolitis 'NEC').  NEC affects 1 of 1000 premature infants with mortality rates up to 50%.  Currently there is no early detection method available.  The BIODESGIN NEC breath analyzer will facilitate treatment and save up to ten thousand or more lives each year through early detection. The device may be adapted to detect sepsis, a deadly late-stage infection.\nThe device consists of four key components - breath collection, gas analysis , data processing algorithm, and a data readout.

Stanford University,Knock-In of Large DNA for Stable and Long-Term High Genomic Expression,Docket #: S20-259,"Published Application: WO2022104344, Published Application: 20240018493",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/knock-large-dna-stable-and-long-term-high-genomic-expression,"Advances in CRISPR-Cas technology have sparked a multitude of novel gene editing possibilities for therapeutic applications. However, synthetically engineered cells using lentiviral systems or adeno-associated virus (AAV) often do not express transgenes to a high enough concentration and cannot persist for a long period of time. In addition, knock-in (KI) efficiency of gene fragments into a precise genomic locus requires improvement, while maintaining long-term, stable, and high expression of the desired KI fragments.\nThe Qi lab invented a novel KI system and methodology that increases efficient KI of DNA fragments with stable, long-term genomic expressions. The two-part KI system includes a nuclease system and an engineered pseudovirus system from a lentivirus to enhance KI and gene translocation. This technology enables incorporation of large genes (7-8kB), exceeding the limitations from currently available technology. The technology also allows simultaneous KI of two genes at different genomic loci in a one-pot reaction. After KI, the cargo can be expressed even after months, showing superior expression stability. By increasing the efficiency and efficacy of gene incorporation, followed by stable gene expression, the invention can overcome the current limitations of existing methods and be a valuable tool in advancing cell-based therapies.\nDesign of KI system: A) the pseudovirus KI template design; B) the nuclease system\nImage courtesy the Stanley Qi lab @ Stanford Bioengineering\nStage of Development – Proof of Concept In Vitro\n\nApplications: Cellular engineering and manufacturing, T cell therapy (i.e., CAR-T), iPSC engineering, Stem cell therapy, Cell-based vaccines.\n\nAdvantages: More efficient than traditional KI methods, Can handle large payloads (over 4kbs, high efficient even for payload 7~8kb), Long-term, stable, and high gene expression, Precise insertion of single and multiple gene fragments."
Stanford University,Targeting Histone Modifier KDMA2 to Enhance Immunotherapy for Cancer,Docket #: S22-040,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/targeting-histone-modifier-kdma2-enhance-immunotherapy-cancer,"Scientists in the Sunwoo Lab at Stanford have discovered that inhibition of the histone lysine demethylase KDMA2 can enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapies, like anti-PD-1.\nWhile anti-PD-1 therapies have revolutionized cancer care for a number of different cancer indications, only about 20% of patients overall are responsive to these drugs. One reason for tumor resistance is a lack of T cell infiltration of the tumor. Strategies that enhance infiltration are promising for overcoming this low response rate and making these life-changing therapies effective for more patients.\nResearchers in the Sunwoo lab have discovered such a strategy by studying the tumor-intrinsic factors leading to anti-PD-1 resistance and lack of tumor infiltration. They discovered a novel target involved in histone demethylation called KDMA2 whose knockdown enhances tumor response to anti-PD-1 therapy in vivo. Small molecule therapies against this target, which are in development in the lab, present a new tool in the immunotherapeutic toolbox that will allow these therapies to reach more patients.\n\nApplications: Small molecule therapeutics to treat cancer, especially in combination with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.\n\nAdvantages: Novel strategy to enhance activity of common anti-cancer therapeutics like anti-PD-1, Expand patient population that can respond to anti-PD-1 therapy."
Stanford University,Granulysin nanobodies to prevent the development of heart attack and stroke,Docket #: S22-067,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/granulysin-nanobodies-prevent-development-heart-attack-and-stroke,"Stanford scientists designed a nanobody platform to inhibit the activity of granulysin, a protein that is often found in arterial plaque and released by T cells, to prevent the development of atherosclerosis such as heart attack and strokes. Currently, direct modulation of the immune system's involvement in the development of heart attacks and strokes is unavailable and prior research involving immune modulators has shown adverse outcomes. While the exact mechanisms through which granulysin affects the development of atherosclerosis are unknown, there is evidence to suggest that granulysin may play a role in the formation and destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. To address this challenge, the scientists designed a nanobody to specifically block the secretion of granulysin and thereby inhibit the formation of plaques. This method differs from conventional treatments, which can have broader effects and sometimes cause unintended side effects. The advantages of the nanobody approach are threefold, spanning greater precision, as it directly targets granulysin to the potential to increase effectiveness by addressing a suspected underlying factor.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Prevention of heart attacks and strokes.\n\nAdvantages: Higher specificity as targeting granulysin directly, Greater potential efficacy as addressing underlying factor, Safer profile with limited off-target impact to healthy cells."
Stanford University,Amphiregulin nanobodies to prevent the development of fibroatheromas,Docket #: S22-068,Published Application: WO2023172699,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/amphiregulin-nanobodies-prevent-development-fibroatheromas,"Researchers at Stanford have discovered that nanobodies blocking amphiregulin (AREG) activity have the potential to impede the progression of early-stage atherosclerotic plaque lesions to advanced-stage fibroatheromas.\nCoronary artery disease is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the build-up of atherosclerotic plaques. In the early stages, the plaques are rich in lipids and can be treated with medication and lifestyle changes. However, as they mature beyond the lipid-rich phase, a subset of activated T-cells within the plaques expresses the pro-fibrotic protein AREG. This protein promotes smooth muscle cell proliferation and fibrosis, leading to advancement of lesions into irreversible advanced-stage plaques, such as fibroatheroma. Fibroatheroma is a major precursor to plaque rupture that could lead to life-threatening acute cardiac syndromes.\nTo prevent the development of fibroatheromas, Stanford researchers have devised a nanobody-based platform that blocks the attachment of AREG to atherosclerotic plaque lesions, hindering disease progression. The nanobody is a bispecific protein with two immunoglobulin single variable (ISV) domains: one ISV domain binds to AREG and the other domain interferes with vascular smooth muscle cells activity. This nanobody-based platform targeting the root cause of fibroatheroma development could revolutionize treatment strategies for patients with coronary artery disease.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Atherosclerosis treatment.\n\nAdvantages: Specifically targets development of fibroatheromas, which cannot be mitigated with current treatments."

Across acute respiratory infections such as influenza and SARS-COVID-19, patients have been susceptible to serious complications, including acute thrombotic events and myocarditis. Notably, similar complications have been observed in certain individuals following vaccination against these viral infections. Prior research has shown that the presence of cross-reactive T cells that exhibit specificity towards arterial plaque could be a central contributing factor to these clinical phenomena. In an effort to address the limited preventative treatments, the researchers developed a method to selectively block regions on T cells responsible for binding self-epitopes. In doing so, plaque progression and the inflammatory process are reduced.\n\nApplications: Prevention of thrombotic complications (e.g., heart attack).\n\nAdvantages: Greater precision by targeting T cells directly, Slower plaque progression, Lower inflammatory-related damage."

Base editors can introduce single base pair mutations directly into genomes, but in addition, can also introduce a variety of different genetic variants. The newly developed single-cell technology can i) genome engineer mutations, ii) directly identify their presence among individual cells and iii) determine each mutation's transcriptional phenotype. The multiplexed approach involves CRISPR base-editors to introduce the desired mutation into a target gene and long-read sequencing of the target gene's transcript  to identify the engineered mutations. Simultaneously, the transcriptome profile can be assessed. The method allows for determination of the mutations' genotype and expression phenotype at single cell resolution via  integration of the long and short read data.

The invention enables complex control of multiple proteins.\nWhile tissue engineering holds immense promise in many therapeutic applications including transplantation and cancer immunotherapy,  the immune system remains a major challenge. To address this issue, Stanford researchers have previously developed  a generalized protease-responsive platform, called RELEASE, to control the secretion and display of surface proteins. Building upon it further, now they have developed a new design to attach a phospho-responsive peptide to RELEASE. Upon phosphorylation of this peptide, 14-3-3 proteins (native scaffolding proteins) will be recruited to the construct, inhibit the retention activity of RELEASE, and result in desired protein secretion. The system also allows for implementation of complex boolean logic by using a phospho-peptide that is constitutively phosphorylated (always ON), but can be removed using proteases.

Stanford University,Methods to improve CAR T cell efficacy and safety by modulating mediators of phagocytosis,Docket #: S21-084,"Published Application: WO2022232569, Published Application: 20240207314",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/methods-improve-car-t-cell-efficacy-and-safety-modulating-mediators-phagocytosis,"There are several barriers to widespread use of CAR T-cell therapy. One of them is toxicity, primarily cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity, but also on-target off-tumor toxicity. Another barrier is the lack of CAR T cell persistence, and more efficacious CAR-T cell therapies are needed especially those targeting solid tumors.\nThe Mackall Lab at Stanford invented a novel way to harness the macrophage – CAR T cell interaction with the goal to address those two limitations: 1) Create a safety switch to quickly deplete CAR T cells in cases of toxicity, and 2) manipulate CAR T cells to enhance their persistence, improving their anti-tumor activity. The safety switch works by blocking """"don't eat me"""" signals on the surface of CAR-T cells, resulting in efficient and fast elimination of CAR T cells by macrophages. Having an off-the-shelf antibody which can effectively deplete CAR T cells when they cause toxicity can be a valuable tool for immunotherapy. To obtain the opposite outcome and increase expansion and persistence exploiting the same CAR-T cell/macrophage regulatory axis, we over-express """"don't eat me"""" signals on CAR T cells. This manipulation has no deleterious effect on their cytotoxic activity, but yields CAR-T cells more resistant to elimination by macrophages, leading to superior activity in models of solid and liquid tumors.\n\nApplications: CAR-T cell immunotherapies, Other T cell based therapies.\n\nAdvantages: Capable of blocking or overexpressing """"don't eat me"""" signals on the surface of CAR T cells depending on the purpose:\n\nOff-the-shelf antibody can be used to effectively block the signal and deplete CAR-T cells when toxic\nOverexpression of the signal in CAR-T cells increase their function, persistence and efficacy, Off-the-shelf antibody can be used to effectively block the signal and deplete CAR-T cells when toxic, Overexpression of the signal in CAR-T cells increase their function, persistence and efficacy."

By discovering co-associations and patterns of cells found within a tumor from gene expression data, EcoTyper creates a detailed atlas for these cells, both cancer and immune.  This invention uses CIBERSORTx, a computational technique, to analyze the RNA of individual cells taken from tumor tissue samples and to purify their distinct gene expression profiles in silico.  The inventors first demonstrated the technology by dissecting the TME of diffuse large B cell lymphoma's (DLBCL) and then in later studies the inventors expanded the technique to profile the TMEs of 16 types of human carcinoma, characterizing multicellular communities of thousands of solid tumors at the transcriptional level.  Almost all the cell types, both known and novel, were validated in a compilation of small conditional RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) tumor atlases.\nThis information allows critical insight into the potential development of individualized immunotherapies for DLBCL and several other types of solid tumor.

Stanford University,Quantum Imaging Technology to Reduce X-Ray Dosage & Improve Sensitivity,Docket #: S23-086,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/quantum-imaging-technology-reduce-x-ray-dosage-improve-sensitivity,"Stanford researchers have developed a method that allows X-ray and CT imaging to achieve the same signal with two to three orders of magnitude less X-ray dosage.\nX-ray is a broadly used imaging modality with a large market of users for many healthcare applications. Its primary disadvantage is that this ionizing radiation can be harmful to the patients and healthcare providers that are exposed. Unfortunately, to have a high enough sensitivity to observe subtle absorption/transmission differences in the sample requires enough high X-ray photon doses which in many cases is enough radiation to be damaging.\nThe method invented here lowers the amount of radiation required by using Compton scattering through a thin carbon target with a pulsed X-ray source to produce an X-ray and an electron which are measured in coincidence. Because the electron and photon are entangled, the detection of the electron means the X-ray photon exists. This quantum concept changes the statistics of the detection allowing a reduction of the number photons required to detect the same absorption/transmission difference from 10,000 photon/pixel to 100 photons/pixel for a 1% difference (2-3 orders of magnitude improvement).\nStage of Development: Concept\n\nApplications: Diagnostic imaging by X-ray and CT.\n\nAdvantages: Reduces X-ray dose 2-3 orders of magnitude for medical image, Improves imaging sensitivity for a given dose."
Stanford University,Using Bispecific Antibodies to Target Cancer Cells for Phagocytic Removal,Docket #: S14-258,"Published Application: WO2016022971, Published Application: 20180355053, Issued: 10,087,257 (USA), Issued: 10,487,150 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/using-bispecific-antibodies-target-cancer-cells-phagocytic-removal,"Stanford scientists have discovered that bispecific antibodies can selectively bind cancer cells and block the CD47-SIRPα """"don't eat me signal"""" to efficiently clear tumors with negligible toxicity. Developing bispecific antibodies to target cancer cells for phagocytosis can be an innovative method to help eliminate tumors and treat various cancers, such as lymphoma and leukemia.\nThe interaction between CD47 and SIRPα transmits a """"don't eat me signal"""" that inhibits phagocytosis as a mechanism for the immune system to identify self from non-self. Cancer cells commonly overexpress CD47 to take advantage of this signal and avoid elimination by phagocytosis. Efforts to block CD47 using recombinant variants of SIRPα have been explored as a therapeutic approach to promote the elimination of tumor cells. However, CD47 expression on normal cells serves as an 'antigen sink,' which reduces the efficacy of CD47 blockade and potentially leads to toxicity due to their phagocytosis. Previous studies have shown that therapeutic antibodies that bind tumor antigens to induce phagocytosis are synergistic with CD47 blockage, suggesting that a bifunctional protein that performs these two functions can be a viable option for specifically and efficiently inducing phagocytosis of cancer cells.\nBispecific antibodies designed by the Stanford researchers have low affinity for CD47, rendering them unable to bind normal cells expressing CD47 alone, and high affinity for the tumor antigen CD20, demonstrating selective binding to CD20/CD47 dual antigen-expressing tumor cells. Importantly, the treatment using these bispecific antibodies in mice transplanted or transfused with cancer cells resulted in a significant extension of their survival and depleted target cells in non-human primates with no observed toxicity. Consequently, bispecific antibodies have the potential to improve cancer treatments by targeting tumor cells for phagocytic elimination in patients.\nFigure:\nFigure Description: A schematic showcasing the design of the CD20/CD47 bispecific antibodies.\nStage of Development:\nPreclinical – in-vivo\n\nApplications: Development of bispecific antibodies to treat cancer, Elimination of cancer cells in lymphoma and leukemia, Increasing the efficacy of CD47 blockage by targeting cancer cells for phagocytosis.\n\nAdvantages: Synergizes CD47 blockade with binding to tumor antigens and induction of phagocytosis, Versatile method that can accommodate the targeting of a plethora of tumor antigens, Function is confined to a single, bispecific antibody which simplifies formulations."
Stanford University,Transiently Regulated CAR-T Cells Engineered to Prevent T-cell Exhaustion and Improve Immunotherapy,Docket #: S17-119,"Published Application: WO2018183888, Published Application: 20210032363, Published Application: 20240293461, Issued: 11,938,153 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/transiently-regulated-car-t-cells-engineered-prevent-t-cell-exhaustion-and-improve,"A Stanford research team has patented methods that can prevent or reverse T cell exhaustion, thereby increasing the effectiveness of adoptive T cell therapies to fight cancer or chronic infections. These include engineering regulatable chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) as well as identifying a group of small molecules that can modulate or inhibit TCR signaling. Immunotherapy using CAR-T cells relies on endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) signaling which is responsible for optimal T cell activation and potent antitumor or anti-infective effects. However, continuous activation of CAR T cells can result in a dysfunctional state called """"T cell exhaustion"""", reducing the overall effectiveness of therapy. To address this overstimulation problem, the inventors genetically engineered a regulatable CAR by attaching a protein domain that allows for control over CAR surface expression via addition of an FDA-approved small molecule drug. This system is designed such that CAR T cells can undergo temporary periods of rest during which the CAR T cell ceases to signal, thus mitigating T cell exhaustion and restoring therapeutic efficacy. In addition, the inventors showed that certain small molecules that inhibit protein kinases can also address the overstimulation problem through transient inhibition of TCR signaling. Both inventions have applications in basic research or immunotherapy for infectious disease or cancer.\nStage of Development - Proof of Concept\nThe inventors have established an animal model of regulating CAR surface expression and demonstrated proof-of-concept for the engineered regulatable CAR system in vitro and in vivo:\nThe inventors also used a known, FDA-approved drug to demonstrate the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on reversing T cell exhaustion and augmenting T cell function in vivo. Further studies and collaborations with additional Stanford researchers have demonstrated similar or stronger effects using different, novel compounds:\n\nApplications: Immunotherapy - prevent or reverse T cell exhaustion in cell therapy for cancer or chronic infection, including:\n\nEx vivo expansion for adoptive transfer\nIn vivo modulation of T cell receptor signaling, Ex vivo expansion for adoptive transfer, In vivo modulation of T cell receptor signaling, Research - engineered T cell receptors and methods using protein kinase inhibitors could be used to study basic T cell function, signaling and exhaustion reversibility.\n\nAdvantages: Enhanced CAR-T immunotherapy:\n\npreventing or reversing T cell exhaustion could improve effectiveness of immunotherapy for cancer or chronic infections\ncould improve cytotoxicity, proliferative capacity, cytokine secretion and formation of memory T cells, preventing or reversing T cell exhaustion could improve effectiveness of immunotherapy for cancer or chronic infections, could improve cytotoxicity, proliferative capacity, cytokine secretion and formation of memory T cells, Transient effects - Controlled CAR expression (and thus CAR signaling) as well as compounds' inhibitory effect on TCR signaling both provide mechanisms for T cells to """"rest"""" and then restore functionality, Direct modulation: - addresses root cause of T cell exhaustion (i.e., persistent antigen exposure leading to continuous TCR signaling) instead of relying on accessory pathways (such as PD-1/PD-L1)."
Stanford University,Multiplex Epstein-Barr Virus Genotyping Nucleic Acid Amplification Test for Detection of High-risk Variants in Human Plasma,Docket #: S22-281,Published Application: WO2024026336,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/multiplex-epstein-barr-virus-genotyping-nucleic-acid-amplification-test-detection-high,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a nucleic acid amplification test to detect high-risk Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) BALF2 variants in plasma to aid population-level screening for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The team designed and validated a multiplex allele-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) genotyping assay to detect three EBV BALF2 variants. As compared to other current assays, this assay is single-reaction, cost-effective, more accurate, and can also provide important genotyping information. It has been through rigorous analytical/clinical validation.\nCommercial application can be in the form of a qPCR kit (analyte-specific reagents or complete kit), which could be purchased by laboratories that offer plasma-based NPC screening.\nStage of Development\nAnalytically and clinically validated assay\nFigures\nFigure Description A, B, C: Multiplex EBV BALF2 genotyping qPCR design, validation, and association studies with nasopharyngeal carcinoma in endemic and non-endemic populations.

In conjunction with the LLODs, the corresponding plasma viral load for 34 screen-detected preclinical NPC cases is presented to indicate likelihood of genotyping success. B) Analytical linearity for each of the four BALF2 qPCR targets, plotting cycle threshold (Ct) against nominal dsDNA control concentration in units of log10 copies/?L template. C) Mixing studies at fixed total template concentration (100 copies/?L template) combining high-risk and low-risk dsDNA controls, demonstrating detection of minor allele fractions as low as 10% for each of the four targets. Measured concentration is plotted against nominal concentration. In the presence of mixed alleles, the assay is approximately linear as allele fraction decreases.\nFigure Description D, E: Multiplex EBV BALF2 genotyping qPCR design, validation, and association studies with nasopharyngeal carcinoma in endemic and non-endemic populations. D) Study overview and experimental workflow. First, the multiplex BALF2 genotyping assay was analytically validated using synthetic dsDNA controls and wild-type B95-8 whole virus control. Next, our non-endemic cohort of 24 NPC cases and 155 non-NPC controls contributed to BALF2 qPCR/NGS validation, longitudinal BALF2 genotyping, and BALF2-NPC association. Finally, our non-endemic cohort and three predominantly endemic cohorts contributed to a meta-analysis of 755 EBV+ NPC cases and 981 non-NPC controls.

Stanford University,Magnetic Robotic Surgery Solution for Minimally Invasive Endovascular Procedures,Docket #: S23-047,Published Application: WO2023219964,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/magnetic-robotic-surgery-solution-minimally-invasive-endovascular-procedures,"Stanford researchers have created a magnetic spinner designed to revolutionize minimally invasive endovascular procedures. Currently, state-of-the-art technologies in this field rely heavily on the expertise of interventional radiologists who use catheters and guidewires to treat patients with various diseases, such as stroke, deep vein thrombosis, endovascular coiling, and transcatheter aortic valve replacement. However, these procedures often encounter challenges when navigating through complex arterial tortuosity in elderly patients, leading to increased procedure time and technical failures. Furthermore, patients may need to be transferred to specialized hospitals where interventional surgeons are available to perform these intricate procedures.\nThe magnetic spinner presents an ingenious solution to address these pressing challenges. By harnessing magnets to move freely inside blood vessels, this device offers a multitude of benefits. Firstly, it enhances navigation within multi-branched blood vessels, reducing procedure time and improving success rates. The device's spinning-enabled propelling enables smooth movement through tortuous paths, making it ideal for elderly patients with complex vascular anatomy. Additionally, the magnetic spinner can be operated remotely, potentially eliminating the need for patient transfer to specialized hospitals. This capability significantly enhances accessibility to high-quality interventional procedures, especially in remote or underserved areas, and ensures patients receive timely and effective treatment.\n\nApplications: Drug delivery, Robotic interventional surgery.\n\nAdvantages: Minimally invasive, Remote operation, Improved patient outcomes."

Both aspiration and stent retriever can fracture the clot during operation, leading to clot fragmentation and distal clots. This proposed procedure prevents fragmentation of the clot through shearing the clot, instead of stretching and breaking it. This invention can reduce the time required to remove large vessel occlusions that can lead to acute ischemic stroke.\nStage of Development\nResearch - in vivo\n\nApplications: Improved thrombectomy method for acute ischemic stroke treatment, Targeted drug delivery -  drug release can be tuned by the spinning speed of the spinner.\n\nAdvantages: Effective and faster, Prevents fragmentation of the clot and reduces clot size through shearing the clot, instead of stretching and breaking it, Enhanced deliverability and safety - utilizes a soft design, which is less invasive to soft tissue."
Stanford University,Use of Verteporfin to Modulate Wound Healing After an Ocular Surgical Procedure or Ocular Injury,Docket #: S21-314,"Published Application: WO2023039168, Published Application: 20240366565",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/use-verteporfin-modulate-wound-healing-after-ocular-surgical-procedure-or-ocular-injury,"Researchers at Stanford have identified the use of the drug verteporfin to treat or reduce the risk of developing ibrosis after ocular procedures or ocular injury. Of interest is corneal injury, for example after refractive surgery or crosslinking, e.g. LASIK and PRK, and also after corneal infections and ulcers, such as bacterial, viral and fungal infections of the cornea. For example, burns and injury to the cornea can lead to permanent scarring of the cornea and loss of vision. In the case of burns and severe injuries, preserving vision requires preventing fibrosis during the healing process, and facilitating transparent, """"scarless"""" tissue regeneration.  Currently, there are no FDA approved treatments that addresses the main cause of corneal blindness after injury, which is the formation of fibrotic scars that degrade or completely block vision.  A topical therapy that can blunt or eliminate the formation of scars may enable patients to avoid an invasive surgery such as a corneal transplant to remove the scar.  Verteporfin, a benzoporphyrin derivative, was FDA approved more than two decades ago as an intravenous injection with photodynamic therapy to treat choroidal neovascularization in the eye, and has been shown to be safe for use with that indication. The drug has been shown to prevent fibrosis in several human organs including the lung, skin, liver and kidney and can be dosed safely in the skin in previous animal studies with minimal side effects. Researchers have shown that a single dose of verteporfin compounded in a carrier can prevent scar formation after corneal injury.\nStage of Development\n-Preclinical animal models\n\nApplications: Treating or reducing the risk of fibrosis after corneal injury, glaucoma surgery, or after other ocular procedures and injuries.\n\nAdvantages: Unmet need for an improved approach to modulate wound healing after ocular injury or surgery, Verteporfin was approved by FDA in 2000 for unrelated mechanism of action and mode of administration for use in ophthalmology."

These reinforced grafts are fabricated using 3D printing techniques and take into account surgical design considerations such as mechanical strength, flexibility, porosity, and the ability to be tailored to specific anatomical structures. Furthermore, these reinforced grafts are designed to mitigate maladaptation and failure after surgery.\nVenous grafts used in coronary artery bypass grafting occlude and fail at a rate of 50% within five to ten years after surgery, leading to repeat revascularization procedures, myocardial infarction, or death in 30% of patients within five years of graft failure. To avoid long-term graft failure, these graft assemblies utilize an external support sheath that provides an adaptive response after surgery.\nStage of Development\nRelated Technology:\nStanford Docket - S19-419 Systems, Devices, and Methods to Prevent Auto and Xeno Graft Failure\n\nApplications: Support for vein grafts in clinical applications including:\n\n coronary bypass graft surgery\nvascular surgery\narteriovenous fistula, coronary bypass graft surgery, vascular surgery, arteriovenous fistula.\n\nAdvantages: Biodegradable, biocompatible, or bioresorbable elastomeric biomaterials, Fast production and customizable - 3D printed using thiol-ene chemistry\n\n Geometric pattern to accommodate sheath curvature\nRadial and lengthwise compressibility to accommodate proximal and distal anastomotic sites, Geometric pattern to accommodate sheath curvature, Radial and lengthwise compressibility to accommodate proximal and distal anastomotic sites."
Stanford University,Therapeutic Verteporfin-Hyaluronic Acid Conjugates,Docket #: S23-426,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/therapeutic-verteporfin-hyaluronic-acid-conjugates,"Researchers at Stanford have developed innovative Verteporfin conjugates that considerably enhance the solubility and therapeutic potential of Verteporfin.\nThe low aqueous solubility of certain therapeutic drugs, including Verteporfin, presents a significant limitation to their modes of administration. This challenge is prevalent across many pharmaceuticals and restricts their potential usage in various treatment regimes, particularly those related to ocular conditions.\nStanford's researchers have overcome this hurdle by combining Verteporfin with a natural biomolecule, thus creating an aqueous soluble compound suitable for topical administration. This conjugation significantly improves Verteporfin's bioavailability, retention time, and therapeutic efficacy. Preliminary studies indicate the conjugate's effectiveness in providing anti-scarring effects on the corneal surface post-injury. This discovery has promising implications for photodynamic therapy for retinal disorders, and the treatment of infections, wound sealing, and additional corneal ectasias.\nStagr of Development\nIn vivo\n\nApplications: Treatment and prevention of ocular surface and corneal scarring, Treatment of corneal ectasia and infections, Sealing of corneal and dermatological wounds, ealing.\n\nAdvantages: Solubilized, highly efficacious Verteporfin, Enhanced bioavailability and therapeutic potency compared to existing Verteporfin treatments."
Stanford University,Lectin-Drug Conjugates Enable Selective Cytotoxicity to Treat Cancer or other Diseases,Docket #: S23-430,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/lectin-drug-conjugates-enable-selective-cytotoxicity-treat-cancer-or-other-diseases,"Selective cytotoxicity, or the ability to selectively remove certain cell types from a population, is a vital technology that is often applied to various therapeutic applications. The most obvious application of these technologies is cancer treatment by eliminating malignant cells while sparing healthy ones, but other applications include treatments for infectious disease or elimination of specific immune cells. Outside of the clinic, researchers rely on selective cytotoxicity to conduct functional genomic screens or directed evolution campaigns.\nThe gold standard approach today is the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). ADCs are comprised of antibodies, which can bind a target antigen with exquisitely high affinity and selectivity. Cells that lack the antigen have much lower exposure to the delivered drug, which reduces side-effects and increases the therapeutic window of these molecules. While a significant advancement, ADCs are far from perfect. Numerous suitable antigens to target with ADC therapy have proven exceptionally difficult to identify. As such, there is a need to develop additional methods of selection that can better distinguish the subtle differences between target and bystander cells.\nThe Bertozzi group at Stanford University has created a lectin-drug conjugate (LDC) as an alternative strategy for selective cytotoxicity. Lectins are proteins that selectively interact with glycoproteins or glycolipids, proving to be useful to distinguish cancer cells that have altered glycosylation from healthy ones. Although they lack the affinity and selectivity of antibodies, they can differentiate between glycoforms in ways that antibodies cannot. The inventors successfully leverage lectin galectin-1 (Gal1) to increase targeting specificity and cytotoxicity in the K562 cancer cell line. They further demonstrated the technique's utility as a functional genomic research tool by isolating a cell-surface receptor that was key to the toxicity of the LDC.\n\nApplications: Targeted therapeutics, such as for cancer, Research tool, such as for functional genomic screens.\n\nAdvantages: Target versus bystander differentiation. Unlike the gold standard of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), the invention has both protein and glycan specificity for increased cytotoxicity to target cells, Improve selectivity due to ability to differentiate between glycoforms in ways that antibodies cannot, Increased cytotoxicity for target cells."
Stanford University,An improved CD206 binder for targeted immune checkpoint blockade and delivery to tumor-associated macrophages,Docket #: S23-438,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/improved-cd206-binder-targeted-immune-checkpoint-blockade-and-delivery-tumor-associated,"Stanford scientists have developed a new, better binder for the tumor-associated macrophage marker CD206. This binder can be conjugated to a variety of payloads, including an anti-immune checkpoint protein antibody for more selective immune checkpoint blockade.\nImmune checkpoint proteins expressed on the surface of immune cells inhibit their activity and prevent excessive immune responses. In cancer, the overactivation of these proteins can prevent the immune system from killing cancer cells. Antibodies that re-activate the immune system by blocking checkpoint proteins (""""checkpoint blockade"""") can therefore treat a wide variety of cancers. However, these drugs can cause dangerous side effects by also activating healthy immune cells, causing the immune system to attack both cancer and healthy tissues.\nStanford researchers therefore invented a new class of checkpoint inhibitors that selectively act on immune cells involved in cancer. These molecules comprise a novel binder for CD206, a marker expressed on tumor-associated macrophages (""""TAMs,"""" immune cells that contribute to cancer progression) conjugated to an antibody that binds but does not inhibit a checkpoint protein. When this molecule binds to a TAM, the cell internalizes and destroys the immune checkpoint proteins on its surface, allowing it to kill cancer cells. These molecules can also destroy soluble immune cell signaling proteins such as cytokines involved in cancer progression. The CD206 binder can also be conjugated to other payloads, such as siRNA, cytotoxic drugs, or imaging agents.\nStage of Development\nIn vitro: selective binding to TAMs and depletion of immune checkpoint proteins and cytokines in macrophage cell lines\n\nApplications: Targeted cancer immunotherapy, Antibodies for imaging tumor-associated macrophages, siRNA conjugates for delivery to tumor-associated macrophages, ADCs for delivery of cytotoxic drugs to tumor-associated macrophages.\n\nAdvantages: Better binding and easier to synthesize than prior, polymeric CD206 binders, CD206 binder can be conjugated to a variety of payloads, More selective and less toxic than traditional checkpoint inhibitors, Platform technology for targeted cancer immunotherapy, Degradation of both cell-surface (i.e.,  ICAM-1) and soluble (i.e., IL-4) proteins involved in cancer progression, More selective and easier to synthesize than prior tumor-associated macrophage binders."

PAN is popular for generating conductive high-strength carbon fibers commonly used in lightweight structural applications including battery systems for sustainable energy storage.  However,  because PAN is insoluble in its own AN monomer, it precipitates to form powder during VP 3D printing making it impossible to print.

Mounting evidence has begun to correlate the dysregulation of mRNA localization to an increasing number of diseases, in particular neurological diseases. However, despite decades of effort, the mechanistic and functional importance of RNA spatial localization has only been explored for a few key examples, largely due to a lack of efficient and programmable approaches that allow for the manipulation of any endogenous RNA localization in cells.\nStage of Development\nResearch – in vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed methods of localizing RNA in a cell in which a localization polypeptide and RNA carrier polypeptide form an intracellular molecular transport dimerization pair.

Immune tolerance to these microbes must be established at each of these contact sites. Treg cells play a major role in establishing and maintaining immune homeostasis in peripheral tissues, particularly at barrier sites where they stably reside.

For instance, current state-of-the-art liquid biopsies are largely focused on nucleic acids in blood plasma. Urine is the ultra-filtrate of blood; some molecules that are present at very low levels in the blood are hyper-concentrated in urine, offering an orthogonal readout to a plasma liquid biopsy. Additionally, urine provides a direct, noninvasive window into the health and functioning of cell types and tissues with low representation in blood. Therefore, the replacement or use of a urine liquid biopsy relative to current clinical readouts on urine (e.g., albumin, urine dipstick, serum creatinine, etc.) may provide a more direct readout into underlying disease.\nStage of Development\nResearch – in vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed methods of detecting cell-free RNA (cfRNA) as well as metabolites in urine samples.

By using alternating current instead of a direct current electric field, energy consumption for this technology is greatly reduced compared to conventional electrochemical remediation. This sustainable method achieves high degrees of contaminant removal for heavy metals at initial concentrations varying from 100 to 10,000 ppm, all reaching corresponding regulation levels for residential scenarios after a treatment time between 30 minutes to 6 hours with no resulting secondary toxic pollution.\nFigure:\nFigure description:\nSchematic of an AACE remediation system.

Stanford University,Enrichment of clinically relevant cell types using receptors,Docket #: S22-133,Published Application: WO2024086518,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/enrichment-clinically-relevant-cell-types-using-receptors,"Introduction: Blood cell transfusion plays a vital role in modern medicine–supporting surgery, obstetrics, trauma care, and cancer chemotherapy. In the US alone, more than 12 million red-cell units are consumed annually. However, the availability is contingent on donor material, resulting in supply constraints and safety concerns. Globally, shortages pose a significant healthcare challenge, expected to worsen with aging populations and diminishing donor numbers. To address these growing medical needs, ex vivo manufacture of red blood cells (RBCs) from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) producer lines emerges as a renewable and scalable solution that offer potential benefits compared to donor blood, including a lower risk of infectious disease transmission, streamlined production, product uniformity, and ability to source or genetically engineer antigen-negative cells. However, this approach remains extremely costly, owing in large part to purified, clinical-grade recombinant cytokines required to stimulate producer cells for expansion and differentiation into erythroid cells. Because erythropoietin (EPO) signaling through the EPO receptor (EPOR) is indispensable to RBC development, of all components in erythroid-promoting media, EPO is by far the most costly.\nMethods: We used the latest synthetic biology tools and genome engineering technologies to de-couple EPOR signaling from the EPO cytokine. Specifically, we devised a series of FKBP-EPOR chimeras that exchanged the requirement for native EPO ligand with an exogenous, orthogonal rapalog small molecule (SM) which we termed inducible EPORs (iEPORs). These were site-specifically inserted in vitro into primary human hematopoietic cells (HSCs) via CRISPR/AAV-mediated genome editing at various HSC and RBC-relevant loci (CCR5 with the PGK and SFFV promoters, EPOR, and HBA1). Using flow cytometry and ddPCR-based assays, we determined the fidelity (i.e., responsivity to SM) and potency (ability to drive differentiation from a stem cell state towards the erythroid lineage) of various iEPOR constructs (different signal peptides and extracellular and intracellular domain modifications) as well as the impact of inserting these chimeras at the aforementioned loci.\nResults & Discussion: We first optimized iEPOR constructs through a highly effective signal peptide present on IL6 and inclusion of the naturally occurring intracellular domain truncation known to enhance erythropoiesis. Together, these modifications allowed us to drive HSCs to 100% differentiation into RBCs in the presence of the iEPOR-dimerizing small molecule. However, we also observed 26.2% differentiation in the absence of any endogenous or exogenous erythroid-biasing ligand. To increase the fidelity of our iEPOR, we integrated our iEPOR at the CCR5 locus and drove expression using the PGK promoter to ablate ligand-independent differentiation (Figure 1A). This identical HSC response to iEPOR in the presence of our small molecule versus native HSC in the presence of EPO was corroborated not only by flow cytometry-based markers of erythroid differentiation but also via HPLC-based assessment of hemoglobin A and F production. iEPOR-integrated HSCs differentiated as described clustered with natively differentiated HSCs vs undifferentiated HSCs by PCA covariance plots and differential gene expression heatmaps (Figure 1B). We observed effectively identical counts of hemoglobin RNA supporting our HPLC findings. Finally, we integrated our optimized iEPOR construct into an iPSC line and devised a consolidated, differentiation strategy from induced pluripotent stem cells to HSCs and, ultimately, RBCs (Figure 1C). Together, this proves our approach serves an ex vivo, EPO-independent RBC production strategy that closely mimics native EPOR signaling by surface biomarkers, relevant protein output, and transcriptional profile. By our calculation, 1nM of dimerizer is approximately 500-fold less costly than 3U/mL of EPO cytokine. This would therefore reduce the cost of EPO cytokine required to generate a single unit of RBCs from $2,760 to approximately $6. Given that dependence on costly cytokines is a common barrier to production of cell-based therapeutics, in the future we believe the strategies defined in this work may enable scalable and renewable ex vivo production of a wide variety of clinically relevant cell types including platelets, neutrophils, T cells.\nStage of Development\nResearch – in vivo\nRelated Technologies\nS21-196: Differential Proliferation of Human HSPCs Using Truncated Erythropoietin Receptors\nS21-175: Potential Curative Treatment for Alpha-Thalassemia Using CRISPR-Mediated Genome Editing\n\nApplications: Hemoglobinopathies.\n\nAdvantages: Greater efficacy by inducing bias in transplanted HSC to yield higher RBC production., Lower toxic and mutagenic regimens are required to stimulate high RBC production., Easy integration into current treatment workflow.."
Stanford University,"Simple, quantitative PCR-based detection and characterization of cancer gene fusions",Docket #: S22-267,Published Application: WO2024081596,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/simple-quantitative-pcr-based-detection-and-characterization-cancer-gene-fusions,"Stanford Medicine's Ji Research Group has developed a simple, quantitative method for detecting and characterizing gene fusions that uses DNA rather than RNA as analyte. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), certain chromosomal translocations correlate with a good prognosis, while some deletions or duplications are linked to an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis. The ability to quickly determine specific cancer mutations provides a clinical advantage and opportunity for precise delivery of targeted therapies.  However, detecting cancer gene fusion is very difficult with current methods.\nThe Ji Research Group overcomes the associated issues by physically isolating target gene fusion from non-targets and from the wild-type, non-rearranged genes.  Their method targets a specific locus prone to rearrangement via an initial PCR based prescreen, and multiplexes for different targets specific to a given cancer, which greatly increases the efficiency of the process.   The target sites are excised with CRISPR edits, and the high molecular weight DNA targets are isolated.  A simple quantitative PCR assay provides an initial, high sensitivity detection that is then followed by long read nanopore sequencing for more extensive sequence characterization of the gene mutation.    This diagnostic method identifies and characterizes specific genomic aberrations in cancer types that can be used to more accurately provide diagnoses, prognoses, and targeted therapies.\nStage of Development – Proof of Concept \nProof of concept studies performed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  Ongoing research will focus on applying the method to clinical uses and a variety of cancers.\n\nApplications: Cancer diagnostics, prognostics, and targeted therapies..\n\nAdvantages: Stable, high-resolution data pinpointing of fused genes, breakpoints and gene variant information., Simple workflow, easy to implement for research and diagnostic labs., Broad use in cancer diagnostics."
Stanford University,Liver Viscoelasticity Changes and Biomarkers for Cancer Invasion,Docket #: S21-302,Published Application: WO2023102546,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/liver-viscoelasticity-changes-and-biomarkers-cancer-invasion,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most common liver disease, leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is one of the most common cancers and has a dismal prognosis as currently available medical treatment only improves survival by a few months. Current guidelines only focus on screening patients for HCC with cirrhotic stage liver disease. However, that 30-40% of all NASH-related HCCs occur in non-cirrhotic livers. These patients often present at a late stage when they are not eligible for liver transplant, and other treatment modalities are very limited. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new screening strategies and develop new biomarkers to improve survival of these patients.\nInventors at Stanford have developed an animal model with NASH and hydrodynamically-induced HCC. Using genetic approaches and inhibitors of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and crosslink inhibitors, inventors discovered that liver AGEs promoted HCC in vivo by increasing tissue viscoelasticity. Viscoelasticity could be modulated by targeting AGE deposition and collagen crosslinking. Higher viscoelasticity promoted HCC cell spread and migration in a novel 3D hydrogel model with high viscoelasticity. Thus, viscoelasticity measurements can be used as a screening and diagnostic tool in the pre-cirrhotic NASH population.\nStage of Development\nProof of Concept\n\nApplications: Mouse model for human NASH/HCC research, Screening platform for potential drugs, drug targets, and biomarkers.\n\nAdvantages: New technology to assess tissue viscoelasticity, Novel screening algorithm for NASH population."

Designing proteins capable of specific targeting of antigens can be transformative and enhance CAR-T treatments.\nTechnology Summary:\nStanford scientists have created a de novo protein design platform that designs binding proteins that specifically target antigens in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Designing proteins capable of specific targeting of antigens can be transformative and enhance CAR-T treatments.\nMHCs are protein molecules that bind pathogen-associated or damage-associated molecular patterns and display them on the surface of cells for recognition by the immune system. T cell receptors (TCRs) have evolved to recognize the peptide identities on the MHC-peptide complexes via interaction with both the antigenic peptide and the MHC. There have been significant efforts to engineer TCRs to allow improved recognition and destruction of virus-infected cells or cancer. However, TCR engineering remains a challenge due to its structural complexity.\nThe creation of a non-TCR protein platform to design functional mimetics of TCRs that recognize the MHC-peptide complexes can overcome the challenges associated with TCR engineering. Proteins that specifically bind to an MHC-peptide complex of interest are designed using computer-based protein engineering and high throughput screening assays. The designed binding protein, or TRACeR, is simpler in structure than TCRs, and comprises an antigenic peptide recognition element and an MHC recognition element. Selected binders are screened for binding strength against thymic epithelial cells to minimize cross-reactivity with self-MHC-peptides. Importantly, TRACeRs have been tested in CAR-T cells and have positive killing results. Consequently, TRACeRs have the potential to drastically improve CAR-T therapy efficacy and transform the CAR-T field by facilitating the design of binding proteins that specifically target relevant antigens.\nStage of Developement:\nPreclinical – in-vitro\n\nApplications: Development of antigen binders for CAR-T therapy, De novo protein design for liquid biopsy tests and other diagnostics.\n\nAdvantages: TRACeRs are straightforward to design and optimize, TRACeRs are specific for the selected antigen, TRACeRs are simpler in structure than TCRs."
Stanford University,Small-molecule control of membrane and secreted proteins via human proteases,Docket #: S23-091,Published Application: WO2024216053,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/small-molecule-control-membrane-and-secreted-proteins-human-proteases,"Researchers at Stanford have created a translational platform capable of controlling protein activity in cellular therapeutics using a human protease. Current tools in synthetic biology that offer control over protein level and activity are sourced from foreign species such as bacteria and viruses. This presents an immunogenic risk for translational applications in human medicine such as cell and gene therapies. This invention alleviates that risk and addresses other key cell therapy challenges by offering small-molecule control over protein level and activity using human-derived components.The platform takes advantage of extracellular human proteases that have high substrate specificity, such as Renin, paired with FDA-approved inhibitors. Proteases can be modified to be secreted, tethered to the cellular membrane, or retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), depending on the desired application. Proteins of interest (POIs) are then modified with appropriate protease cleavage sites to control their activity and localization. POIs can be engineered to have their activity reconstituted, abrogated, or released from the ER or cellular membrane upon cleavage. Overall, this platform technology allows proteases to be exogenously expressed to control genetically modified proteins of interest, which can be used in cell therapies for multiple indications.\nStage of Development:\nProof of Concept\n\nApplications: Can be used in cellular therapeutics to control protein secretion, activity, and membrane expression using human components:\n\nCancer\nAutoimmune diseases\nMuscle regeneration, Cancer, Autoimmune diseases, Muscle regeneration, Can be used in cellular therapeutics to reduce or eliminate immunogenic risk.\n\nAdvantages: Protein circuits can be compactly expressed in single transcripts for engineering of cells., Allows user control via dosage of a small-molecule inhibitor., Eliminates the immunogenic risk of foreign bodies used in current therapies.."
Stanford University,Using human cathepsins as therapeutic degraders of pathological mucins,Docket #: S23-393,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/using-human-cathepsins-therapeutic-degraders-pathological-mucins,"Stanford scientists have discovered that a subset of human cathepsins can degrade cancer-associated mucins. Targeted protein degradation of pathological mucins using these enzymes can be a platform technology for a new class of mucinopathy therapeutics for disorders such as cancer, infectious disease progression, autoimmune disease, and cystic fibrosis.\nMucins are densely glycosylated proteins that are known to be involved in tumor-progressive pathways. However, mucins are difficult to target using classical therapeutics (e.g. small molecules and antibodies) and remain canonically undruggable. Therapeutic interventions face the challenge that mucins contain no catalytic site to inhibit with a small molecular, nor a binding site that prevents function upon blockage with an antibody. Targeted protein degradation of pathological mucins has shown promise as a novel treatment for a variety of mucinopathies.\nHere, a subset of human cathepsins has been demonstrated to degrade mucins within densely glycosylated mucin domains. Importantly, these cathepsins can degrade purified, recombinant, and cell-surface mucins. Consequently, directing the enzymatic activity of these cathepsins to pathological cells has the potential to degrade disease-relevant mucins and enhance the medical field by treating mucinopathies in patients.\nStage of Development:\nPreclinical – in-vitro data\nContinued research – engineer lead candidate to enhance mucin-selectivity, generate cell-type targeted cathepsin conjugate, demonstrate efficacy in reversing mucin-associated pathologies\n\nApplications: Development of therapeutics for mucin-associated cancers, Other therapeutic applications such as treatment of gut dysbiosis, cystic fibrosis, and bacterial endocarditis.\n\nAdvantages: Bypass challenges associated with classical therapeutics by degrading undesirable mucins, First-in-class approach of using human proteases to degrade disease relevant mucins, Versatile platform that can be used with targeting molecules for the development of novel biologics to treat a myriad of diseases."
Stanford University,Rapid Identification of Peptide-ligands from Protein Antigen (RIPPA),Docket #: S21-090,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/rapid-identification-peptide-ligands-protein-antigen-rippa,"Stanford scientists have developed a novel method to accelerate the development of T cell target probes known as Rapid Identification of Peptide-ligands from Protein Antigen (RIPPA). RIPPA aims to streamline the laborious processes involved in isolating relevant peptide/MHC-II characteristics necessary for T cell epitope discovery both experimentally and computationally. The specificity of T cell responses relies on the recognition of unique peptides presented by MHC-II molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. However, the heterogeneity of MHC-II alleles and labor-intensive purification process across currently employed methods, results in lengthy screening periods often ranging between 4-6 months.\nRIPPA enables a much larger panel of MHC-II alleles to be screened within a short time frame and in a cost-efficient manner. By genetically modifying an array of yeast cell clones to express a specific MHC-II allele in their native-like format, RIPPA quickly screens pathogenic peptides for their binding to tens to hundreds of MHC-II alleles over the span of a month. Characterization of relevant peptide/MHC-II characteristics will guide T cell research and therapeutic endeavors involving T cell-dependent immunity. Furthermore, RIPPA's ability to generate a vast amount of peptide/MHC-II binding data will propel computational approaches for T cell epitope discovery.\n\nApplications: T cell dependent therapies (e.g. vaccines and other immunotherapies), T cell dependent diagnostics (e.g. T cell staining), Structural biology research (e.g. crystallization studies).\n\nAdvantages: Faster by eliminating lengthy repeated steps, Cheaper by eliminating costly labor-intensive steps, Larger data generation capability."
Stanford University,Molecules and methods for treatment of cancer with TCIPs,Docket #: S23-242,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/molecules-and-methods-treatment-cancer-tcips,"Researchers in the laboratories of Nathanael Gray and Gerald Crabtree at Stanford University have developed and synthesized new small molecule chemotherapeutics for targeted (and potentially less toxic) treatment of cancers having high BCL6 levels including lymphomas and other human hematopoietic cancers.  These small bifunctional molecules engage the cancer driver, BCL6 on one side and a molecule binding a histone acetylase transferases (HAT) on the other side of the molecules; and rewire the cancer driver (BCL6) to activate cell death genes such as P53, BIM, NOXA, PUMA and others that then kill the cancer cell using its own driver.  These Transcriptional/Epigenetic Chemical Inducers of Proximity, or TCIPs, function at picomolar concentrations to kill human cancer cells specifically that express both the anchoring transcription factor and the histone modifying enzyme and have little toxicity to other human cells. Preliminary studies demonstrate good pharmacologic features and feasibility for human safety studies. These HAT-BCL6 TCIPs could provide a targeted  treatment of Diffuse Large Cell B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) having mutations in the BCL6 gene. In addition, these molecules may be useful for treatments of other cancers and hematologic malignancies having high BCL6 levels or mutations.\nStage of Development\nPre-clinical: The Gray and Crabtree Labs continue pharmacologic optimization, animal safety and efficacy studies, and future human safety studies.\n\nApplications: Cancer treatment – in particular Diffuse Large Cell B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), and other malignancies expressing BCL6 and histone acetyltransferases..\n\nAdvantages: More targeted and effective (and potentially less toxic) – especially for Diffuse Large Cell B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) that is commonly treated with RCHOP, a combination chemotherapy which often causes permanent neurologic damage, anemia, and bone marrow repression, and leads secondary malignancies., Possible treatment for tumors that have metastasized and spread beyond surgical resection.."
Stanford University,Targeted integration at alpha-globin locus in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells,Docket #: S19-140,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/targeted-integration-alpha-globin-locus-human-hematopoietic-stem-and-progenitor-cells,"?-thalassemia is a devastating blood disorder caused by mutations in the HBB gene encoding ?-globin, where treatment involves lifelong, costly management of the resulting lack of hemoglobin and hemolytic anemia. In addition to the shortage of ?-globin, the accumulation of ?-globin is also a significant contributor to disease pathology, driven by expression from two highly homologous genes, HBA1 and HBA2.\nStanford researchers have optimized a CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing technique to replace one of the two genes encoding ?-globin with a functional version of HBB. Despite the similarity of the HBA1 and HBA2 genes, the inventors have developed highly selective CRISPR guide sequences that can specifically knock-in the HBB gene into the HBA1 locus, leaving the HBA2 gene intact. The resulting gene expression profile produces a normalized ratio of ?-globin and ?-globin to restore functional hemoglobin.\nResearchers demonstrate that hematopoietic stem cells can be edited efficiently to replace HBA1 with HBB, and successfully engraft and reconstitute in a mouse model to restore hemoglobin levels. Due to the redundancy of alpha-globin genes and the fact that site-specific integration at the HBA1 locus achieves a red blood cell-specific expression profile of custom transgenes, this technology has broad clinical application outside of thalassemia.\nOngoing Research\nResearchers find that in patient-derived cells they were able to: 1) efficiently edit HSPCs; 2) normalize the ratio of beta-globin:alpha-globin; 3) restore functional hemoglobin; and 4) successfully engraft edited cells into mice.\n\nApplications: Treatment of alpha and beta thalassemia, Treatment of monogenic blood disorders, Harnessing red blood cells as a therapeutic delivery vehicle via integration of a therapeutic gene into the HBA1 locus.\n\nAdvantages: Potential one-time treatment for a chronic blood disorder, Effective independent of patients' mutation profile, Does not rely on expression of fetal hemoglobin, which may not be maintained indefinitely in adults, Does not use a lentiviral vector, negating risk of random integration, Autologous treatment approach has low risk of immune rejection of transplanted hematopoietic stem cells, No requirement for  matched bone marrow donor."

Stanford University,Scalable 3D Nanofabrication via Upconversion,Docket #: S23-469,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/scalable-3d-nanofabrication-upconversion,"Stanford researchers have created a system that enables efficient fabrication of complex three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures via triplet-triplet-annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC).\nThere is a growing interest in fabricating complex micro and nanoscale 3D structures for various clinical and research applications. One of the most well-established techniques for nanoscale 3D fabrication is two-photon polymerization (2PP). However, 2PP is slow and expensive, because it uses high-powered lasers that allow for only monovoxel printing per light source.\nResearchers at Stanford have proposed TTA-UC, which uses lower power sources, as an alternative to 2PP. Materials involved in this process contain a sensitizer-annihilator pair, a photoinitiator, and monomers. The sensitizer absorbs lower energy photons to make the annihilator emits higher-energy photons. The photoinitiator then triggers the assembly of the monomers, or polymerization by absorbing the upconverted photons. The researchers have identified a resin with an ideal ratio of appropriate components for TTA-UC. They then demonstrated that TTA-UC can be parallelized by incorporating a digital micromirror device to project millions of voxels simultaneously. Additionally, they developed algorithm that makes grayscale and sparser versions of the intended design to prevent unintended polymerization in neighboring pixels, allowing them to print more complex 3D structures.\nStage of Development\nFunctional prototype\n\nApplications: Fabrication of nanotools in the fields of, Plasmonics, Nanophotonics, Microoptics, Nanooptics, Robotics, Biomedicine, Extended reality.\n\nAdvantages: Improved speed and resolution, Industry scale production possible, Can be adapted to other materials such as glass and ceramics, Can be adjusted to incorporate biocompatibility."

The solution involves injecting a degradable hydrogel into the intestinal wall to narrow the lumen and enable the confinement of a coiled spring. Currently, no devices are available for deploying inside the intestine to achieve this and existing methods necessitate surgical procedures to anchor the intestinal expanding device. However, as an injectable hydrogel, the solution facilitates endoscopic delivery of the coiled spring into the gastrointestinal tract. While the hydrogel solution enables strategically deploying devices within the gastrointestinal lumen for a transient duration, this approach may also be employed for drugs intended for a particular section of the gastrointestinal tract, anchoring the device near the area of interest instead of opting for systemic delivery.\n\nApplications: Minimally-invasive method for anchoring intestinal lengthening device (short bowel syndrome), Targeted drug delivery in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nAdvantages: Lower need for surgical intervention, Lower costs required for device placement, Quicker recovery time."

The Stanford researchers used quantized and heavily pruned bottleneck-based networks with dense custom latch arrays (CLAs), to create a tight, integrated compute and memory device.  Their low-read-energy, dense CLAs and high degree of parallelism of their dense compute fabric facilitate dataflow with inputs and outputs only read/write once. This eliminates the need for a data buffer in the memory hierarchy, saving silicon area and memory accesses.   The resulting, energy efficient, near ideal device is as dense as possible and cheaper to read than conventional standard-cell-based latch array.\nStage of Development – Prototype\nThe Murmann group tested their custom chip prototype and verified the end-to-end performance and power/energy per-inference estimates. Their CLA implementation in 28nm achieves 60x lower read energy (1.6x higher density) than iso-port width SRAM macros of the same capacity made by a memory compiler, and more than 5x lower energy (2x higher density) than a latch array synthesized from standard cells in the same technology. Further chip testing and architecture analysis is underway.\n\nApplications: IoT devices and high-end consumer electronics such as VR glasses, phones, and security cameras., Edge computing devices that perform machine learning inference in power/energy-constrained environments., IC design to run larger ML models on power-constrained devices and to achieve higher compute performance given low power/energy budget devices..\n\nAdvantages: More energy efficient and lower cost:, 60x lower read energy (1.6 x higher density) than iso-port width SRAM macros of the same capacity made by a memory compiler., More than 5x lower energy (2x higher density) than a latch array synthesized from standard cells.."

Unlike existing methods, this platform allows measurement of parameters of population (tumor) growth for a very large number of independent clonal populations (tumors) within the same mouse, providing exquisitely precise, cheap, and rapid estimate of effects of tumor-suppressors function modification on tumor growth in vivo. Because Tuba-seq enables the analysis of multiple pathways in the same animal using a very large number of independent tumors, it is much faster, much more precise, and is a much less expensive way to investigate tumor-suppressor function as well as genotype-specific therapeutic responses.

Stanford University,QUANTIFICATION OF CELLULAR PROTEINS USING BARCODED BINDING MOIETIES,Docket #: S20-449,"Published Application: WO2022164893, Published Application: 20240125797",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/quantification-cellular-proteins-using-barcoded-binding-moieties,"Technology Reference: Chan Zuckerberg CZB-190S; Stanford S20-449\nSummary\nResearchers at Stanford have developed a method enabling quantification of intracellular protein levels using oligonucleotide-barcoded antibodies.\nMultiplexing single cell technologies affords researchers the ability to characterize cell states and identify gene regulatory programs across various cell types. The application of sequencing-based surface protein quantification using barcoded antibodies to intracellular or nuclear protein targets has been challenging. Nuclear targets are particularly challenging due to high levels of background oligo-antibody staining, potentially driven by the conjugated single stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligo. However, quantification of nuclear transcription factors, the drivers of gene regulation, would enable critical understanding of gene regulatory processes. For this reason, several approaches to reduce non-specific staining include saturating cells with single stranded nucleic acids or other charged polymers to block non-specific binding to ssDNA oligos.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed methods quantify intracellular and nuclear targets within a single cell using antibodies conjugated to barcoded oligonucleotides. The inventors reduced non-specific oligo-antibody staining by coating the conjugated ssDNA oligo with single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs). The inventors demonstrate the utility of this technology in profiling CD4 memory T cells by combining SSB-coated oligo-antibodies in nuclear protein quantification with ATAC-seq and RNA-seq (NEAT-seq).\nStage of Development\nResearch – in vitro\n\nApplications: Directly measure single cell protein levels of cytoplasmic or nuclear targets, like transcription factors, with improved signal over background., Oligo-antibody staining in combination with other single cell genomic measurements (e.g., ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, Hi-C, etc.) or perturbating screening for comprehensive cell profiling..\n\nAdvantages: Modular and flexible design can be applied to any target binding moiety (e.g., antibody fragment, ligand, aptamer, etc.) and incorporation to existing single cell pipelines (i.e., split-pool protocols and microfluidics), Single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs) bind with high affinity to ssDNA in a sequence non-specific manner, with low affinity for nuclear dsDNA., SSBs are compatible with oligo PCR amplification steps during library generation."
Stanford University,Using symbolic computing to accelerate model discovery for multiscale systems,Docket #: S23-436,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/using-symbolic-computing-accelerate-model-discovery-multiscale-systems,"Stanford scientists have created software, referred to as Symbolica, for automating model development for multiscale systems that can accelerate the generation of multi-physical models by 10^5 times what can be completed by hand. Symbolica has the potential to democratize powerful model development strategies in a similar manner to how computational physics software offer communal access to the rapid deployment of numerical methods.\nWhile multiscale models significantly increase computational efficiency (i.e., reduce simulation times from days or weeks to minutes or hours) and accurately model physical processes across multiple scales, their utilization and perceived relevance are commonly narrowed to idealized systems of low complexity. This is due to the rigorous mathematical derivations necessary to generate such models, which become analytically intractable for systems of realistic complexities and must be carried out by-hand. As such, significant time (i.e., months to years, even for field experts) and specialized expertise in theoretical development (i.e., mathematical formulation and field knowledge) are required to obtain multiscale models, making them infeasible for practitioners to employ in application.\nSymbolica accelerates multiscale model development by using symbolic computation to automatically carry out analytical manipulations exactly as an applied mathematician would do by-hand. By doing so, rigorous multiscale models can be generated in a feasible amount of time (i.e., seconds or minutes as opposed to months or years). This is a similar speed up to how early computers accelerated computations that were done by hand and has no limitations in analytical tractability. and no need for specialized expertise in theoretical development. While the capabilities of Symbolica have been demonstrated for applications related to thermal runaway in battery packs and reactive transport in porous media (see publications), its generality allows its application to a wide variety of multiscale, multi-physical systems. In this sense, Symbolica democratizes powerful model development strategies, as there is no need for specialized expertise, and has the potential to transform access to multiscale modeling.\nFigure:\nFigure description: A flowchart of the procedure completed by Symbolica\nStage of Development:\nPrototype\n\nApplications: Apply Symbolica as a model generation/selection tool., Produce a software for automating rigorous mathematical model development., Produce a software for engineering design..\n\nAdvantages: Automatic computations for theoretical model development, Speed up of multiscale model development by several fold, No need for specialized expertise."
Stanford University,Detecting neuroinflammation: Novel PET tracers allow accurate tracking innate immune activation,Docket #: S23-025,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/detecting-neuroinflammation-novel-pet-tracers-allow-accurate-tracking-innate-immune,"Researchers at Stanford have identified GPR84 as a new highly specific imaging biomarker of neuroinflammation and innate immune activation. After proving that GPR84 is significantly upregulated in both human cells/tissues (in the context of inflammation) and mouse models of neuroinflammatory diseases, they developed PET tracers that bind with high specificity to this target.\nTracking the innate immune system is vital when developing new therapies for a range of diseases, including cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and neurodegenerative diseases, to enable patient stratification and real-time monitoring of therapeutic response. In particular within the central nervous system this has been challenging due to the lack of methods to detect and quantify inflammation in the brain with high specificity in a non-invasive manner.\nThis new approach developed by  researchers at Stanford, involving PET tracers targeting GPR84, could be used to more accurately diagnose and stage neurological diseases, and other inflammatory coniditons, in addition to aiding in the development of better therapies for diseases such as, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.\nStage of Development \nIn vivo preclinical\n\nApplications: Research into understanding innate immune responses in the context of disease, Detection of innate immune activation and neuroinflammation, Monitoring response to immunomodulatory drugs.\n\nAdvantages: More specific detection of innate immune activation non-invasively, Novel target and tools for tracking neuroinflammation."
Stanford University,Composite Inclusion Graft for Ross Procedure,Docket #: S22-308,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/composite-inclusion-graft-ross-procedure,"Stanford researchers at the Woo Lab have invented a composite inclusion graft that addresses several challenges associated with the Ross procedure, such as late autograft dilation.\nThe device consists of a straight Dacron graft with a rigid sewing ring for autograft proximal anastomosis, and it includes reference markings for precise commissure suspension. To accommodate different surgical preferences, circular markings on the graft can be utilized for direct anastomosis or left intact for a 3-layered anastomosis. The inclusion technique aims to support the autograft and prevent late dilation but may be challenging to perform. Surgeons face potential issues such as distorted neo-annulus during autograft implantation and bleeding complications during coronary button anastomosis, especially with the 3-layered technique, which may result in pressure build-up and potential blood flow occlusion.\nThis change to the inclusion technique was developed to support the autograft and prevent this late autograft dilation. The change to this composite graft is very intuitive-to-use, easy-to-incorporate, prevents neo-annulus distortion in the aortic root, and allows for different options for coronary button anastomosis.\nStage of Development\nPrototype Design\nFigure\nRelated  Technologies\nStanford docket S22-333 """"Geometric Aortic Graft"""" describes an advanced version of conventional aortic grafts with a reinforced suture area which reduces bleeding around the anastomosis line.\nStanford docket S22-404 """"Innovative prosthetic valve design for severe mitral annular calcification"""" describes an innovative prosthetic valve which ensures a perfect seal to eliminate risk of potential para-valvular leaks.\n\nApplications: Ross Procedure for aortic valve replacement.\n\nAdvantages: Very intuitive to use, Easy to incorporate, Prevents neo-annulus distortion in the aortic root, Allows for different options for coronary button anastomosis."
Stanford University,Geometric Aortic Graft,Docket #: S22-333,Published Application: WO2024229417,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/geometric-aortic-graft,"Stanford researchers at the Woo Lab have developed an innovative supra-hemostasis aortic graft, an advanced version of conventional aortic grafts. Current aortic grafts do not have reinforced suture area which can cause bleeding around the anastomosis line.\nThe key feature of this graft is a distal segment with a slightly larger diameter than the main graft, enabling the creation of a smooth, double-layered aortic graft when folded down. An interior skirt becomes an extension of the aortic graft after folding, providing an extra layer for suturing or serving as the sole suture line.\nThis design offers versatility and aims to address the common issue of bleeding in aortic procedures, providing reinforced suture areas to mitigate concerns about bleeding around the anastomosis line. The device is applicable for aortic root or aortic arch anastomosis, allowing for a double-layered, reinforced anastomosis with the added benefit of the supplementary skirt for enhanced suture line reinforcement.\nStage of Development\nPrototype Design\nFigure\nRelated  Technologies\nStanford Docket S22-308 """"Composite Inclusion Graft for Ross Procedure"""" describes a composite inclusion graft that addresses several challenges associated with the Ross procedure, such as late autograft dilation.

Stanford University,Innovative prosthetic valve design for severe mitral annular calcification,Docket #: S22-404,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/innovative-prosthetic-valve-design-severe-mitral-annular-calcification,"Stanford researchers at the Woo Lab have designed an innovative prosthetic valve to address challenges in mitral valve replacement for patients with severe mitral annular calcification (MAC). Conventional procedures often result in para-valvular leaks due to the difficulty in removing all calcification, leading to poor patient outcomes.\nThe new valve design features a large detachable skirt proximal to the sewing cuff, allowing an additional layer of graft material to be sewn onto the left atrial tissue, ensuring a secure seal and eliminating the risk of potential para-valvular leaks. The design accommodates patients without severe MAC by allowing the skirt to be detached.  This design comes in a collapsed geometry to allow for sewing ring implantation first, followed by skirt expansion, and lastly a second anastomosis suture line.

Stanford University,The use of mechanotransduction inhibitors as a coating for surgical sutures to reduce scarring,Docket #: S23-082,Published Application: WO2024191790,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/use-mechanotransduction-inhibitors-coating-surgical-sutures-reduce-scarring,"Researchers at Stanford have proposed that coating surgical sutures with mechanotransduction inhibitors may reduce scarring of the tissue.\nWhen the skin or other tissues are wounded, the body initiates a healing process. While shallow wounds may heal without a scar, injuries involving thicker tissues, such as the dermis or fascia, often lead to visible scars characterized by abnormal color, contour, rugosity, and breaking strength. Over time, scars may improve in appearance and breaking strength as collagen structures remodel and blood vessels form. However, these characteristics will never fully match those of normal (unwounded) skin, and certain functional elements like hair follicles and sweat glands do not regenerate, resulting in permanent functional losses. Currently, there is no therapeutic strategy to either prevent or reverse scarring.\nUpon learning that the primary pathway responsible for scar formation is mechanotransduction, Stanford researchers studied the impact of mechanotransduction inhibitors on fibrosis. Inhibitors targeting proteins such as Focal Adhesion Kinase, Yes Associated Protein, Piezo1 and Piezo2 effectively reduced scarring, restoring both appearance and full function. Surgical sutures, used to close open tissues or attach medical devices, present a promising avenue for scar prevention. Coating sutures with any or combinations of the mechanotransduction inhibitors could reduce future scarring. Also, these sutures could be used in scar revision surgeries to reverse scarring.\nStage of Development\nPrototype\n\nApplications: Skin wounds (ex. Incisional wounds or burns), Postpartum recovery, Surgeries involving joining tissues, Medical device implant, Laparotomy surgery, Scar revision surgery, Organ fibrosis, Pathological skin scarring conditions (Dupuytren's disease, fibrotic dermal scarring, hypertrophic scarring, keloid scarring, corneal and other ocular tissue scarring).\n\nAdvantages: Capable of both preventing and reversing scarring, Can be combined with active agents (antimicrobial, antibiotic, or antiseptic) to improve the prognosis, Simple fabrication process, making it scalable."
Stanford University,Bipolar Electrodes With Gas-Transporting Layers,Docket #: S23-145,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/bipolar-electrodes-gas-transporting-layers,"Stanford researchers have developed an innovative replacement of bipolar membrane (BPM) electrodialysis, called bipolar electrode (BPE) to split water into separate streams of protons and hydroxide ions more efficiently and cost effectively.\nThe use of acid and base reagents in industrial chemical processes often leads to the production of large amounts of salt by product. Instead of treating the salt as waste, electrochemical technology can be employed to regenerate acid and base from the salt and water. Current state of the art technology, bipolar membrane (BPM) electrodialysis, is not very efficient or durable for splitting water into protons and hydroxide.To address this issue, Stanford researcher have invented the bipolar electrode (BPE) comprising two catalyst layers surrounding a gas-transporting layer. One catalyst generates a gaseous product (e.g., hydrogen), transported to the other layer for oxidation, resulting in separate streams of protons and hydroxide ions. The BPE's performance scalability depends on thermodynamic potentials and electrocatalyst effectiveness, and its design prevents parasitic ion crossover, eliminating the need for ion-exchange membranes, presenting significant advantages over BPMs.\nStage of Development \nPrototype: small bench-top prototype built\n\nApplications: Production and recovery of organic acids and bases, Purification of mineral ores, Production of cementitious materials.\n\nAdvantages: In comparison to gold standard BPE:, Total blockage of ion crossover, Lower overpotential, Increased energy efficiency, increases throughput and reduces capital cost, Easier manufacturing, Greater durability, Low cost."
Stanford University,Synthetic bi-functional degraders of aV integrins,Docket #: S23-277,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/synthetic-bi-functional-degraders-av-integrins,"Stanford scientists have invented protein degraders that induce lysosomal degradation of extracellular cargo. These protein degraders can be used to promote the degradation of integrins, which have implications in several fibrotic diseases, and serve as a highly effective therapeutic for patients suffering from fibrosis.\nOrgan fibrosis is characterized by excessive deposition and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), which ultimately disrupt normal tissue architecture and functions. For example, renal fibrosis affects 800 million people worldwide and dialysis treatment is becoming a significant economic burden. As the principal ECM receptor, integrins are implicated in diverse fibrotic diseases such as renal fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, and scleroderma fibrosis. Despite the tremendous interest, the development of inhibitors focusing on integrins has faced substantial challenges such as low in vivo efficacy, undesired effects, lack of tissue specificity, and integrin subtype specificity.\nProtein degraders of integrins have resulted in the first known class of integrin inactivators that induce degradation of a cell-surface integrin via lysosomal targeting instead of simply blocking integrin activity. Importantly, targeting integrins in this manner addresses the four key challenges mentioned in the previous paragraph. Consequently, inducing degradation of integrins can drastically improve fibrosis treatment efficacy and transform the fibrotic disease medical field.\nStage of Development\nProof of Concept\n\nApplications: Induced degradation of integrins associated with fibrosis, Treatment of fibrotic diseases.\n\nAdvantages: Limits undesired effects associated with direct binding of integrins, Enhanced tissue specificity and subtype selectivity."
Stanford University,A suprachoroidal spacer implant to treat glaucoma,Docket #: S23-174,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/suprachoroidal-spacer-implant-treat-glaucoma,"To manage the development and progression of glaucoma, researchers at Stanford University have developed a biocompatible suprachoroidal spacer implant. This implant leverages a specialized delivery system into the suprachoroidal space, and effectively lowers the intraocular pressure (IOP).\nElevated IOP is a major risk factor for glaucoma, which is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. While there are several methods to reduce IOP, each approach has inherent limitations. Daily eyedrop administration can be compromised by patient medication adherence and limited tolerability; laser procedures are not adequately effective for many patients; current surgical procedures damage the conjunctiva and are ultimately compromised by scarring; and sustained-release drug-loaded implants may damage the anterior chamber and in any case only last months.\nAs a promising alternative, Stanford researchers have developed a suprachoroidal implant effective at lowering IOP. The implant can be delivered by a custom microneedle injector that is designed to avoid requiring any suturing after delivery, and therefore can be performed in the outpatient clinic setting. Being able to lower intraocular pressure with a one-time treatment that can be performed in the clinic and without needing to go to the operating room could revolutionize glaucoma care. Upon implantation within the suprachoroidal space, uveoscleral aqueous outflow increases, leading to a sustained reduction in IOP. Delivery and data validation in relevant laboratory models has been achieved.\nStage of Development\nThe researchers have prototypes of the implant and the injector that are being actively improved and optimized. They have completed ex vivo experiments and are preparing for in vivo studies.\n\nApplications: Lowering IOP to mediate conditions such as, Glaucoma, Ocular hypertension, Exfoliation syndrome, Pigment dispersion syndrom.\n\nAdvantages: Long-term IOP control without daily management, Monolithic implant with structural integrity, Biocompatible, Minimally invasive, office-based procedure, Easy to deploy in underdeveloped setting, Does not hinder the ability to perform additional glaucoma surgery, No cyclodialysis cleft, merging the anterior chamber with the suprachoroidal space, No anterior chamber manipulation and no expected endothelial cell loss, Precise injection with customized injector."

Using a wiring harness between hands is one solution, but it is impractical for everyday use and poses safety risks. The preference is for a wireless bimanual connection to ensure safety. The key technology is this wireless solution, combined with dedicated stimulation algorithms that achieves and maintains synchronization between gloves, enhancing patient safety, usability and therapeutic efficacy.

Stanford University,An Extrudable Biomaterial with Heat-Resistant Bioactivity and Tunable Degradation,Docket #: S23-458,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/extrudable-biomaterial-heat-resistant-bioactivity-and-tunable-degradation,"Researchers at Stanford University have formulated a novel biomaterial suitable for three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting: a homogeneous composite of polycaprolactone (PCL), gelatin, and beta-tricalcium phosphate.\nThe 3D bioprinting technology uses biomaterials and cells to construct functional 3D structures with potential applications as tissues, organs, or drug delivery vehicles. Polylactic acid (PLA) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) are commonly used for bioprinting due to their mechanical integrity and biodegradability, but they pose a risk of an inflammatory response as their acidic degradation byproducts accumulate. PCL, another robust biodegradable biomaterial, produces fewer acidic byproducts. It is a promising alternative when blended with gelatin, which has fast degradation kinetics. Although Homogeneous PCL gelatin (PG) blends have been made before using electrospinning, the resulting products were limited in geometry and lacked consistency in fiber quality.\nStanford researchers have devised a methodology to fabricate a more versatile homogeneous PG composite with tunable degradation kinetics and high biocompatibility. Gelatin nanoparticles embedded in this composite can be taken up by cells to enhance proliferation and differentiation. This bioactivity persists even after repeated exposure to high temperatures (>100 °C). Therefore, the new PG composite can be extruded into bioactive 3D filaments to be used for a variety of biofabrication applications.\nStage of Development\nThe researchers have completed in vitro assessments of cell proliferation and toxicity and in vivo implantations in rats to establish safety and efficacy.\n\nApplications: Regenerative medicine research, Drug testing, Bone grafting, Tissue repair, Controlled-release drug delivery, Biocompatible implants.\n\nAdvantages: Biocompatible – limited immunogenicity, Fast and tunable degradation, Contains gelatin nanoparticles that aid cell proliferation and differentiation, Can withstand repeated exposure to high temperatures while retaining bioactivity, Can be processed into bioactive 3D filaments for extrusion-based bioprinting, High customizability in final construct geometry, 3D reconstructions, Porous scaffolds, Meshes, Thin films."
Stanford University,A high-sensitivity assay for predicting human innate immune responses to rAAV vectors,Docket #: S23-129,Published Application: WO2024226496,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/high-sensitivity-assay-predicting-human-innate-immune-responses-raav-vectors,"Stanford researchers have developed a high-sensitivity cell-based assay for predicting the innate immune response to recombinant adeno-associated virus.\nRecombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has enabled the development of transformative gene therapies for disorders ranging from spinal muscular atrophy to hemophilia B. However, the use of rAAV is limited by its immunogenicity, which can result in reduced therapeutic efficacy as well as dangerous and even deadly reactions in patients. While rAAV engineering promises less immunogenic vectors, these efforts are hindered by a lack of tools for predicting immunogenicity pre-clinically. Animal models have very different immune systems from humans, while cell-based models are non-physiological and display poor immune responses to rAAV. Assays employing human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are similarly limited by wide variability between donors and low sensitivity.\nTo address this challenge, Stanford researchers developed a new tool for predicting innate immune responses to rAAV. rAAV capsids are first opsonized (tagged for recognition by the immune system) with an anti-AAV monoclonal antibody and then incubated with human PBMCs. PBMC immune activation can be measured by cytokine production or the expression of T-cell activation markers. Researchers showed that opsonization enabled immune responses from otherwise unresponsive PBMCs and discrimination between closely related but differentially immunogenic rAAVs.\nStage of Development\nIn vitro: assay elicits an rAAV-induced immune response in otherwise unresponsive PBMCs that increases with exposure to unmethylated CpGs\n\nApplications: Tools for rAAV research, Clinical development of rAAV-mediated vaccines and gene therapies, Validation of lot-to-lot rAAV consistency during manufacturing, Basis for human subject inclusion or exclusion in rAAV clinical trials, Companion diagnostic for evaluating patient suitability for rAAV gene therapies.\n\nAdvantages: High sensitivity, Simple, in vitro assay, Distinguishes immune responses towards closely related rAAV vectors, Predicts immune responses without the need for animal models, Overcomes issues with variability between PBMC donors."
Stanford University,"Energy-efficient, environmentally-friendly secondary wastewater treatment using a novel membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) design",Docket #: S22-370,Published Application: WO2024081433,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/energy-efficient-environmentally-friendly-secondary-wastewater-treatment-using-novel,"Stanford researchers have developed a strategy for secondary wastewater treatment using a membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) design that enables the simultaneous removal of pollutants and recovery of potent greenhouse gas (N2O) emissions.\nConventional domestic wastewater treatment is based on aerobic processes, resulting in a large carbon footprint due to high energy consumption and N2O emissions during biological nitrogen removal. A recent systems-level analysis emphasizes that carbon footprint due to N2O emissions is more significant than the footprint resulting from energy use.  Anaerobic secondary treatment has been proposed to enable energy-efficient removal of organic matter but will have similar N2O emissions in a post-treatment for biological nitrogen removal. A method for N2O emission control is clearly needed.\nTo address this, Stanford researchers developed a novel strategy where a membrane-aerated bioreactor (MABR) is incorporated for both aerobic secondary treatment and tertiary treatment after anaerobic secondary treatment to recover N2O produced during biological nitrogen treatment. Biofilm attached to gas permeable membrane surfaces in the MABR effectively remove biodegradable compounds from the aqueous phase, enabling low energy consumption. The biofilms also create a driving force for counter diffusion of N2O from the membrane-attached biofilm into the lumen of the membranes. This driving force increases N2O concentration within the lumen, facilitating recovery of N2O-enriched off-gas and minimization in carbon footprint. The N2O-enriched off-gas can be used for energy production in a biogas engine or in a system that recovers combined heat and power (CHP).\nStage of Development\nPilot: treatment of 4,320 gallons of secondary effluent per day at the Silicon Valley Clean Water wastewater treatment facility, enabling recovery of > 99% N2O with a low energy requirement ( 0.06 kWh/m3)\n\nApplications: Wastewater treatment.\n\nAdvantages: Simple, single-step process, Enables reduction in > 90% greenhouse gas emissions, Low energy requirement due to highly efficient aeration, Improved versatility and reliability of wastewater treatment."
Stanford University,Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Management of Enteric Diseases,Docket #: S07-230,"Published Application: WO2009035510, Published Application: 20110027891, Issued: 8,535,946 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/biomarkers-diagnosis-and-management-enteric-diseases,"There is an urgent need for the development of sensitive, specific and non-invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of patients with enteropathic diseases such as celiac sprue. Such biomarkers could be used in primary screening of potential patients, definitive diagnosis of suspected patients, monitoring response to therapies, drug compliance assessment, and cost-effective drug development. Two such biomarkers, summarized below, have been invented and patented at Stanford University. For simplicity, the descriptions that follow are limited to their relevance to celiac sprue, although application to other enteric diseases (e.g. inflammatory bowel diseases) is also anticipated.\nBackground:\nCurrent diagnostic methods for celiac sprue are based on serum antibody tests, a small bowel biopsy, and a clinical response to a gluten-free diet. Although antibody tests are fairly specific, patients must be exposed to the discomfort of high doses of gluten over extended durations before they seroconvert. Whereas small bowel biopsies are the """"gold standard"""", they are obtained via invasive and expensive endoscopic procedures; their handling and examination requires considerable expertise and is often subjective. Clinical signs and symptoms associated with celiac sprue are variable, even in the same patient, and therefore not particularly useful. For example, although patients with active celiac sprue show statistically significant differences in fat or xylose absorption or lactulose permeability compared to patients in remission, these markers are peripherally related to celiac sprue immunopathogenesis, and can undergo significant changes due to factors unrelated to the disease. There is therefore an urgent need for biomarkers that complement the strengths and weaknesses of serological and histological tests in the context of diagnosis.\nAlthough a definitive path for celiac sprue drug development has not been established, ongoing efforts are based on clinical protocols that are adapted from existing diagnostic practices. For example, changes in histology, serology, fat or xylose absorption, lactulose permeability, and gastrointestinal symptoms are generally monitored either in the context of a gluten challenge (if the protective capacity of the drug candidate is being evaluated) or along the normal course of recovery (if the ability of the drug candidate to accelerate full recovery is being evaluated). There is an urgent need for """"scaleable biomarkers"""" that can serve as useful, preferably primary, endpoints in early proof-of-concept clinical trials as well as late-stage registration trials.\nOn a longer-term horizon, as new drugs for celiac sprue are approved, one can anticipate a need for biomarkers that facilitate assessment of compliance and response to therapy. Not only would this enhance the physician's ability to manage the patient's life-long disease, but it would also add value to selected drugs in an increasingly competitive market.\nThe Technologies:\n\nApplications: Biomarkers for diagnosis and drug development for celiac disease, and potentially other enteric diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nAdvantages: Large potential impact - 1 in 200 people are affected by celiac disease, Less invasive than bowel biopsy, Complements existing histological & serological tests."

Stanford University,Mobile Thermoelectric Cooler for Organ Transport (MoTEC),Docket #: S23-258,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/mobile-thermoelectric-cooler-organ-transport-motec,"Stanford inventors have developed a mobile thermoelectric device designed to preserve organs during transit by maintaining 10°C (+/-1°C) for over 6 hours. Transplants are often life-saving treatments and with a limited organ supply optimizing preservation during transit is crucial for enhancing access and health outcomes. The current standard for donor organ preservation involves a sterile ice-filled cooler ranging between 2-4°C. While a low temperature is necessary to slow tissue deterioration, recent studies indicate that such low temperatures might also increase the risk of freeze-related injury, limiting the organ's transplant viability. A storage temperature closer to 10°C could offer better preservation, but no existing portable system can maintain this range for an extended period.\nMoTEC, a thermoelectric cooler designed to keep a donor organ at a stable 10°C (+/-1°C) while in transit, aims to address this challenge. The solution consists of a two-compartment system with an outer recirculating water cooling unit and an inner organ storage chamber. The system offers temperature control and wireless monitoring through continuous feedback-regulated cooling via custom-designed pumps and sensors. MoTEC is powered by an external battery, allowing for up to 4 hours of standalone operation, with the flexibility for longer use when connected to a power source. Following each transport, the system can be sterilized and reused, resulting in both a smaller spatial footprint and lower costs.\nFigure Caption: An image of the current working prototype of the thermoelectric cooler shows the battery that enables temperature control (left) and the enclosure for organ storage during transit (right).\n\nApplications: Lung organ preservation during transit, Heart organ preservation during transit, Kidney organ preservation during transit, Liver organ preservation during transit.\n\nAdvantages: Lower probability of temperature-driven ischemic injury: optimal temperature maintenance during transit, Greater temperature control: continuous feedback-regulated cooling via integrated pump and sensors, Greater data availability: wireless temperature and power source monitoring, Greater cost savings: reusable design."

Stanford University,Coupling of Heterologous Antigens to Overcome Subtype Bias and Broaden Vaccine Efficacy,Docket #: S23-065,Published Application: WO2024197156,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/coupling-heterologous-antigens-overcome-subtype-bias-and-broaden-vaccine-efficacy,"The low efficacy of multi-strain vaccines against rapidly evolving viruses, such as influenza, necessitates the development of novel methods to broaden the immune response in vaccinated individuals. The efficacy of the current seasonal influenza vaccine is typically ranges from 19% to 60%. We identified that the low efficacy is due to the phenomenon of subtype bias, which arises from limited CD4+ T cell 'help' across all strains. That is, even though the vaccine contains multiple strains, most individuals elicit a robust immune response to only one of the strains. This leaves individuals vulnerable to infection by other strains. Subtype bias occurs in approximately 65% of the vaccinated individuals which suggests that eliminating it may be a valid path to increase vaccine efficacy.\nStanford scientists have discovered that coupling of antigens from multiple influenza strains can overcome subtype bias by increasing CD4+ T cell help, thereby inducing a robust immune response to all strains included in the formulation. The antibody response against multiple strains was higher with the coupled antigen formulation in comparison to the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine in a human organoid system, and a mouse model. Coupling of antigens can be a transformative method to eliminate subtype bias in multi-strain vaccine formulations needed against rapidly evolving pathogens, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2.\nStage of Development\nPreclinical – in vitro human organoid model and in vivo animal data\n\nApplications: Development of multi-strain vaccines against influenza and SARS-CoV-2., Elimination of response bias in vaccines formulated with multiple antigens., Increasing vaccine efficacy against rapidly evolving pathogens..\n\nAdvantages: Broadens the immune response in individuals vaccinated with multi-strain formulations., Versatile coupling method that can be used to formulate vaccines against diverse pathogens.."

To overcome these challenges and enable sustained immune activation in the tumor microenvironment the inventors have developed this technology.  It provides PLGA nanoparticles functionalized with anti-CD28 antibody to deliver immunostimulants, including IL-2, TLR2 agonist and NOD2 agonist, in a controlled manner.

Stanford University,"Rapid generation of human forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain cells from human pluripotent stem cells",Docket #: S23-285,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/rapid-generation-human-forebrain-midbrain-and-hindbrain-cells-human-pluripotent-stem,"Creating human brain progenitors and neurons from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offers vast possibilities to study, model and treat neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, which are among the most intractable diseases that afflict our society. Despite successes in generating certain types of brain progenitors and neurons from hPSCs, generating a wide range of these cells for various brain regions has remained difficult. In particular, it has remained incredibly challenging to generate hindbrain cells. The hindbrain is a key region that constitutes the majority of the brainstem and is a life-sustaining region that controls breathing, eating, wakefulness, and sleep.\nThe Loh Lab at Stanford has developed methods to rapidly create forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain progenitors from hPSCs (within several days), and additionally, multiple types of forebrain and hindbrain neurons (within two weeks). This is accomplished by treating hPSCs with different combinations of extracellular signals in defined, serum-free medium. While these hPSCs can differentiated into multiple brain regions, the inventors have accomplished the first human hindbrain motor neurons differentiation from hPSCs. Hindbrain motor neurons are destroyed by neuron degenerative diseases like spinal muscular atrophy. Therefore, the invention's newfound ability to create human hindbrain motor neurons and other types of neurons provides new opportunities for basic research, disease modeling, and regenerative therapies to replace missing or malfunctioning neurons in vivo.\nStage of Development:\nResearch - In Vitro\n\nApplications: Cell therapy, Neurodegenerative diseases, Cellular techniques.\n\nAdvantages: First and only known invention of a hindbrain cell therapy candidate, Enables study of hindbrain brain cells, such as neurons, which have never been accessible for this scale of research before, Method can be used to differentiate other neuron cells for all brain regions."
Stanford University,A Method of Enhancing Nerve Regeneration and Repair Using a Small Molecule Smoothened Agonist Applied Directly to Sites of Nerve Repair or Surgery,Docket #: S21-398,Published Application: WO2024173529,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/method-enhancing-nerve-regeneration-and-repair-using-small-molecule-smoothened-agonist,"Peripheral nerve injury is widespread, with U.S. estimates of over 200,000 cases per year and worldwide estimates as high as 1 million cases per year. Although in cases of minor injury, peripheral nerves can regenerate, for more severe injuries, direct microsurgical nerve repair is the preferred treatment. surgery often improves neurologic function in cases of severe peripheral nerve injury, but complete recovery of function is unfortunately quite rare. Surgical repair may fail to restore normal function as seen in approximately 40-60% of cases. There are currently no pharmacologic treatments available to patients that can accelerate nerve regeneration after injury and observation, direct surgical repair, or nerve graft repair. Given the high failure rate of complex nerve reconstruction, more effective methods of reconstruction are necessary.\nStanford researchers have found that a low dose of a small-molecule, systemic pathway agonist, SAG21k, improves nerve regeneration after injury and increases expression of injury-responsive genes within Schwann cells in the injured nerve. SAG21k is a potent hedgehog signaling pathway agonist that targets Smoothened, the key pathway effector protein. Administration is also feasible during surgery and may reduce the risk of systemic side effects.\nStage of Development\nIn vivo mouse models: researchers have found that the Smo agonist SAG21k improves nerve regeneration after injury in a mouse model. Current work entails translating this to a topical treatment that can be applied during surgery along with commonly used nerve sealants (ie, fibrin hydrogel or fibrin nerve wraps) that may limit potential systemic toxicity of the small molecule being administered systemically.\n\nApplications: Surgical nerve repair, Any peripheral or cranial nerve.\n\nAdvantages: First drug that contains a biologically active compound to facilitate nerve regeneration after injury, Can be used in conjunction with commonly used nerve sealants (e.g. fibrin hydrogels), Increases chance of surgical nerve repair."
Stanford University,Environmentally Friendly Fertilized Water Production via Cold Plasma,Docket #: S21-096,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/environmentally-friendly-fertilized-water-production-cold-plasma,"Stanford Plasma Physics Lab researchers have developed a scalable system to manufacture fertilize water, or plasma fixated nitrogen (PFN) in water, using cold nonequilibrium plasma.  Current fertilizer manufacturing use roughly 1% of the world's total energy production and contributes 1% or more of the world's CO2 emissions.  We have our PFN's bio-uptake on turf grass. Turf grass, used in residential and commercial lawns, golf courses, and recreational and sports fields, is one of the largest irrigated crops in the United States.  The Stanford Plasma Physics Lab system (figure 1) uses a non-thermal plasma (cold, electrified air) near a thin sheet of water to activate the water directly, infusing it with peroxynitrates, which have biostimulant properties.  This portable, scalable, economically viable, plasma-fixated nitrogen fertilized water system is ideal for small agricultural facilities, specialty farms, hydroponic facilities, and indoor farms, as well as commonly used turf grass with no CO2 emissions and nearly zero carbon footprint when using electricity from renewable sources.\nFigure 1 Effects of Nitrate Concentration on Growth for Plasma Fixated Nitrogen Fertilized Ryegrass.

Stanford University,Optimizing clonal expansion of CD8 T cells by using silent mutations,Docket #: S22-077,Published Application: WO2023249934,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/optimizing-clonal-expansion-cd8-t-cells-using-silent-mutations,"Stanford scientists have discovered that using silent mutations to alter codon:anticodon affinity can be used to tune clonal expansion in CD8 T cells. Optimizing the differentiation and expansion of CD8 T cells can be a transformative method that increases the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapies.\nSynonymous single nucleotide variants (sSNVs), or silent mutations, are genetic variations that occur in protein-coding regions of the genome but do not change the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. While sSNVs were initially thought to be functionally neutral, they have recently been shown to effect gene expression, translation, and protein function. For example, the codon:anticodon specificity between a tRNA and an mRNA can affect the timing of translation and the co-translational folding of the protein. Despite their potential impact and prevalence, sSNVs are often overlooked in genome-wide association studies. Understanding the effects of sSNVs can gain insights into disease mechanisms and methods for optimizing precision medicine approaches.\nAn sSNV that increases codon:anticodon affinity was found to be enriched in effector memory CD8 T cells (CD8 TEMs). Importantly, this sSNV was expanded specifically in CD8 TEMs with minimal enrichment in other cell types. Consequently, this establishes proof-of-concept that a more favorable codon can be utilized to facilitate increased and specific clonal expansion of CD8 T cells in vivo.\nStage of Development:\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Optimization of CD8 T cell differentiation and expansion, Development of more efficacious CAR T-cell therapies.\n\nAdvantages: Enhancement of CD8 T cell activity by introducing silent mutations, High potential for novel enhancement mechanisms from previously overlooked sSNVs."
Stanford University,A Method for Suppressing Innate Immune Responses to RNA Therapy,Docket #: S22-415,Published Application: WO2024167836,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/method-suppressing-innate-immune-responses-rna-therapy,"Stanford researchers have developed a method to suppress immune responses to RNA therapy by chemically treating the RNA with an acylating reagent.\nRNA therapy, which uses RNA-based molecules to modulate biological pathways, is a versatile and specific approach with the potential to treat a wide range of diseases. One of major hurdles to advancing RNA therapy is immunogenicity; injected or administered RNAs can be recognized by the immune system as foreign entities, triggering an innate immune response that might reduce the therapeutic efficacy and possibly cause side effects. There have been efforts to address this by modifying the structure or sequence of RNA nucleotides, suppressing the immune system, and packaging RNA within a shielding delivery system.\nResearchers at the Kool Lab in Stanford have identified a novel method to mitigate the immunogenicity problem. They used an acylating reagent to add acyl groups to the 2'-hydroxyl (OH) groups on RNAs. Lipofecting cells with the resulting polyacylated RNAs prevented recognition by toll-like receptors (TLRs) that typically trigger the immune response. Consequently, this led to a reduction in inflammatory responses without affecting translation. This approach is beneficial in that the RNA can be from any source and be of any length.\nStage of Development\nIn vitro data in cultured cells. They are expanding the in vitro research to test in a wider range of cell types, including primary cells.\n\nApplications: mRNA vaccines, mRNA therapeutics, RNA interference, CRISPR therapies and diagnostics, siRNA, RNA aptamers, Anti-sense oligonucleotides.\n\nAdvantages: Can address a wide range of diseases:\n\nGenetic disorders\nCancer\nNeurological disorders\nInfectious diseases, Genetic disorders, Cancer, Neurological disorders, Infectious diseases, Allows for targeted therapy, Could be personalized, Post-transcriptional method, Can apply to RNAs of any length and origin, Reversible, Immune system not altered, Translation is not compromised, Rapid and simple modifications."

While its selective permeability is crucial for neural protection, it makes drug delivery to the brain extremely difficult, limiting treatment efficacy for various neurological or psychiatric conditions. It is important to enable the necessary therapeutics to traverse the BBB in order to ensure targeted and efficient delivery to the intended brain region.\nStanford researchers have discovered a brain drug delivery method that capitalizes on a natural transport mechanism. They identified and engineered a drug delivery platform based on a plasma protein called Apolipoprotein A1 (Apo1A1) that can inherently cross the BBB. The ApoA1-conjugated active therapeutic agent crossed the BBB successfully and was found in brain microglia in mice.\nStage of Development\nIn vivo data\n\nApplications: Brain drug delivery platform for:\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases\nBrain tumors\nNeurological infection\nPain management\nPsychiatric disorders\nTrauma, Neurodegenerative diseases, Brain tumors, Neurological infection, Pain management, Psychiatric disorders, Trauma.\n\nAdvantages: Novel, Leverages the natural uptake of plasma protein by microglia to cross the BBB, No alteration of the BBB or immune system required."
Stanford University,Environmentally friendly synthetic palm oil production from agricultural waste,Docket #: S23-125,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/environmentally-friendly-synthetic-palm-oil-production-agricultural-waste,"Stanford researchers have developed a process for synthetic palm oil production that is environmentally friendly and can be implemented locally by farmers.\nPalm oil is an essential commodity used in everything from processed foods to personal care items like toothpaste and soap. However, current methods for palm oil production are responsible for deforestation, greenhouse gas production, and the exploitation of farmers and their communities.\nStanford researchers therefore developed a method for producing palm oil from agricultural waste that can be locally implemented by farmers themselves. Palm fronds are first pre-treated using microwave energy, an inexpensive and energy-efficient process that eliminates the need for chemical additives and extracts sugars from the palm fronds. Then, a yeast species specialized for fat production digests the sugars into fats that can serve as a drop-in replacement for palm oil in personal care products or as feedstock for biofuel production.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept: demonstrated microwave pre-treatment process that extracts fermentable sugars and yeast fermentation process that can produce a drop-in replacement for palm oil.\n\nApplications: Drop-in replacement for pam oil in personal care/beauty products, Environmentally friendly and socially conscious personal care and beauty products, Feedstock for second generation biofuel production.\n\nAdvantages: Use of waste material is inexpensive and environmentally friendly, Highly efficient pre-treatment process, Lack of harsh chemicals in pre-treatment process allows waste to be used as fertilizer, compost, etc., Optimized for use on farms in producing countries (not US-based labs), Decentralized approach is readily scalable."
Stanford University,Hybrid plasmonic core-shell nanostructures for photocatalysis,Docket #: S23-317,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/hybrid-plasmonic-core-shell-nanostructures-photocatalysis,"Stanford researchers within the Dionne Lab have developed a method to use copper titanium dioxide core-shell nanoparticles for the light driven production of green fuels or removal of contaminants in water.\nCurrent approaches to photocatalysis include semiconductors like titanium dioxide; however, they only absorb ultraviolet light, which forms less than 5% of the sunlight that reaches Earth. A promising approach is the use of hybrid plasmonic metal nanoparticle-semiconductor nanostructures, which are the strongest light absorbers per volume and have a highly tunable absorption cross-section that spans the entire visible and near-IR spectrum. Previous examples of plasmonic-semiconductor hybrids relied on noble metals like gold and silver, which prevented this technology from being scalable for real-world applications.\nStanford researchers instead use core-shell hybrid nanoparticles from earth-abundant copper and titanium precursors. This invention is a simple two step method that can use sunlight to drive photocatalysis. Used for water purification, this invention does not require maintenance, is effective against chemicals, plastics, and pathogens, and results in no toxic byproducts.\nStage of Development\nFigure:\nFigure description:Copper core absorbs light, and electrons are excited into higher energetic states, leaving behind holes.

Stanford University,Nanoparticles Containing Toll-Like Receptor Agonist for Enhanced Efficacy of Immune Checkpoint Blockade,Docket #: S19-279,"Published Application: WO2022226032, Published Application: 20240197910",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/nanoparticles-containing-toll-receptor-agonist-enhanced-efficacy-immune-checkpoint,"Stanford inventors have developed a nanoparticle containing the toll-like receptor agonist (TLR7-NP) that elicits a potent anti-tumor immune response in multiple cancer types without inducing undesired systemic inflammation and toxicity. The nanoparticles precisely incorporate the TLR agonist, yielding a tightly controlled composition that is then released at a consistent manner under physiological conditions, therefore reducing toxicity. Researchers in the Davis lab treated mice with these engineered TLR7-NPs and observed inhibition of tumor growth, prolonged survival, and effective immunological memory in colon, pancreatic, and glioma cancer models. Mice treated with TLR7-NPs and anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade therapy in combination exhibited even more robust antitumor efficacy, eliminating all tumors in a colon cancer model, and rejecting the second tumor challenge. This combination therapy also induces tumor regression and improves survival in a pancreatic cancer model. These results were recapitulated in a human skin tumor organoid where TLR7-NP and anti-PD-1 combination therapy induced a robust T cell response. Mechanistically, the TLR7-NPs are hypothesized to increase conventional dendritic cells in the tumor draining lymph nodes, expanding functional CD8+ T cell memory and activation for antitumor responses. The TLR7-NPs represent a robust and broadly applicable cancer immunotherapy that can be used in conjunction with checkpoint blockade therapies.\nStage of Development\nIn vivo\n\nApplications: Novel cancer immunotherapy modality.\n\nAdvantages: Potent yet safe method to deliver toll-like receptor agonists to elicit anti-tumor immune response, Sustained release of TLR7 agonist allows for continuous immune stimulation using low drug doses in the local microenvironment, Broadly applicable cancer immunotherapeutic strategy that is effective against multiple tumor types (colon, pancreatic, glioblastoma), Nanoparticles allow surface modification for precise spatial control, Nanoparticles have well-controlled physiochemical properties with precise composition, drug loading, and tunable drug release kinetics, Versatile delivery routes: both intratumoral and intravenous delivery, Facile scale-up manufacturing suitable for widespread use."
Stanford University,TLR7-agonist-nanoparticle vaccine adjuvant,Docket #: S21-063,"Published Application: WO2022226035, Published Application: 20240207394",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/tlr7-agonist-nanoparticle-vaccine-adjuvant,"Stanford researchers have developed a nanoparticle adjuvant with spatiotemporal controlled release of TLR7 agonist for broad protection against influenza or SARS-CoV-2.\nVaccines made from inactivated viruses or protein subunits offer numerous advantages. However, with current aluminum-based adjuvants, these vaccines often require multiple doses or fail to elicit broad antibody responses against constantly mutating viruses such as seasonal influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2 virus. Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists have shown promise as more potent adjuvants, but progress has been limited by toxic side effects. In response, the researchers have applied well-controlled chemistry to formulate an adjuvant from PEG-PLGA nanoparticles loaded with TLR7 agonist via an ester linkage. This chemistry allows for the programmed release profile of TLR7 agonist in the body - slow release in circulation and faster release in intracellular endosomes, promoting immune responses and reducing systemic serum cytokine expression. This adjuvant platform also improves lymph node accumulation and enhances cellular uptake, which leads to significant improvement of humoral and cellular immune responses, including broad antibodies against different antigenic variants and cytotoxic T cell responses. Notably, it can induce stalk-specific influenza hemagglutinin antibodies (considered an important goal in developing a universal flu vaccine).\nStage of Development\nPre-clinical. When administered with influenza hemagglutinin in mice, the TLR7-agonist nanoparticles induce a cross-reactive antibody response and improve heterosubtypic infection survival. With SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the adjuvant promotes antibody response in mice and human tonsil organoids.\n\nApplications: Adjuvant to multiple vaccine platforms including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, Potential adjuvant to HIV vaccine.\n\nAdvantages: Controlled release to minimize toxic side effects, Induces early cross-reactivity for influenza subtypes and SARS-CoV-2 variants, Innovative synthesis method allows large-scale, consistent production, Highly biocompatible nanoparticle polymers (PEG-PLGA)."
Stanford University,Process for the Pulsed Laser Ejection of Multiple III-V Thin Film Solar Cells from One Thin Film Growth,Docket #: S20-091,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/process-pulsed-laser-ejection-multiple-iii-v-thin-film-solar-cells-one-thin-film-growth,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a technique that can rapidly and sequentially separate multiple sets of III-V solar cell thin films grown as a stack on one III-V wafer. Their rapid laser liftoff wafer recovery technique may reduce cost and fabrication time by an order of magnitude. Currently, gallium arsenide (GaAs) single crystal growth substrates – used for the best performing solar cells – are expensive and difficult to grow (accounting for an estimated 1/3 of the cost of GaAs solar cells). Because the GaAs solar cells do not depend on the substrate for operation, it is desirable that the solar cell thin films be removed from the GaAs wafer and the wafer reused for multiple growths. The Stanford process, by effectively multiplying the number of cells that may be recovered per wafer reuse, can significantly increase throughput and reduce costs. Moreover, the process is not limited to solar cells and may be used to produce many III-V thin film devices.\nStage of Development\nThe researchers report that their process achieves the same effect as multiplying the number of possible wafer recovery cycles by x, where x is the number of devices grown per growth process. In other words, if a wafer can be reused 10 times with the laser liftoff process, growing 5 devices per growth would be equivalent to reusing the wafer 50 times, therefore lowering the average substrate cost.\n\nApplications: Single-crystal III-V optoelectronic thin film devices such as high-efficiency single- and multi-junction III-V solar cells, LEDs, and detectors (e.g., ejected detector arrays)..\n\nAdvantages: Leverages the unique benefits of laser liftoff relative to other wafer recovery techniques, e.g., the process takes minutes instead of hours and does not require long substrate acid exposure., Allows for multiple devices from each substrate use., Compared to laser liftoff of a single device, this process reduces the average energy consumed per device produced by utilizing only a single substrate heating and cooling cycle per set of x devices, thus reducing the time for energy payback., Precludes poor surface quality issues. Sending the laser pulse through the device instead of the substrate eliminates the need to protect the optical quality of the substrate backside (i.e., lower surface) during thin film growths.."

Self-healing polymers, which can recover from various forms of damage, often include conductive or dielectric particles for added functionality and are typically arranged in a multilayer configuration. While these polymers usually self-heal effectively when layers are aligned, misalignment can significantly reduce healing efficacy. To address this, Stanford researchers created a laminate with immiscible dynamic polymers, each with the same dynamic bond for strong interlayer adhesion but different backbones for interfacial tension-mediated realignment. This design ensures complete self-directed structural and functional recovery after damage.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Soft robotics, Surgical modeling, Films and coatings for industrial uses, Implantable flexible electronics, Wearable flexible electronics.\n\nAdvantages: Less risk of misalignment and functional loss, Can incorporate multiple functions, Inspired by the human skin healing process, Potential for countless applications with other immiscible polymers."

Lasers need a way to prevent the light they emit from reflecting into the laser and destabilizing it.  Bulky magnetic devices are typically used to block the reflections, which is unfeasible for chip-scale lasers.  Jelena Vuckovic's group solves this problem by combining the laser feedback stabilization and isolator into a single integrated device (see figure 1).  This device uses a high quality factor ring or disk resonator that acts as a circulator under high optical power. The ring coupled to a laser or optical gain media and combined with a feedback path stabilizes the lasing mode, reducing laser linewidth by several orders of magnitude.  These devices need no external drives and operate without generating electromagnetic or magnetic field background interference.  Simplifying and integrating the stabilization and isolation, reduces data communication systems costs and enhances performance, which opens new commercial opportunities in LiDAR, spectroscopy, and mobile optical computing.\nFigure 1 Optical image of hybrid integration of DFB laser with the isolator\nImage courtesy the Nanoscale and Quantum Photonics Lab\n\nApplications: Integrated lasers for:, Data communications systems including the Internet, Lidar, Spectroscopy, Mobile optical computing.\n\nAdvantages: Reduces bulk, complexity, and cost, Simple, combined stabilization and isolation, Fabricated via existing semiconductor processing technologies and well-known semiconductor-based material, Passive and magnet free, integrated high-performance chip-scale laser."

Individuals with the same histopathological classification can have tumors with drastically different molecular profiles and clinical responses to treatment. Malignancy is defined by a set of abnormal biological capacities, termed the hallmarks of cancer, and decades of histopathologic and molecular profiling of human tumors have demonstrated that there are multiple ways cells can acquire each hallmark. As a result, the molecular profile of tumors with the same clinical characteristics can vary dramatically from individual to individual, and it is unclear when these molecular differences originate, all of which can impact treatment options. Finally, current prediction of relapse is generally only 1-5 years, and it is desirable to obtain more accuracy to determine proper treatment and when a pre-malignant tumor will become malignant.\nStage of Development\nResearch – in vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed methods to use (i) a tumor subtype (malignant or premalignant) of a subject, e.g. whether a particular cancer has an alteration in a particular region, and (ii) germline epitope burden for the particular region, e.g. amount of peptide epitopes generated from the germline of a subject, to determine the probability: (i) of a relapse of a particular tumor subtype, (ii) of immune response given a particular subtype, and (ii) that a pre-malignant lesion will become malignant.\n\nApplications: Methods to investigate germline-mediated immunoediting, Molecular modeling for improving cancer risk stratification, Predicting relapse of a particular tumor subtype in a subject, Predicting immune response of a particular cancer subtype in a subject, Predicting the risk of premalignant tissue becoming cancerous in a subject.\n\nAdvantages: Using a measurement of epitope subtype burden, along with tumor subtype, can increase accuracy of relapse prediction., Epitope burden and tumor subtype can also be used to determine efficacy of immune therapies for a particular subject, as well as a risk that a pre-malignant tumor will become malignant.."
Stanford University,Using machine-learning to leverage variations in DNA methylation for early lung cancer detection,Docket #: S22-485,Published Application: WO2024124207,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/using-machine-learning-leverage-variations-dna-methylation-early-lung-cancer-detection,"Stanford scientists have discovered that differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be used as a blood-based biomarker for early cancer detection. Using machine-learning to detect DMRs in blood-based tests could increase cancer screening uptake in high-risk adults and reduce lung-cancer-related mortality\nImage-based screening of high-risk adults, such as individuals with a history of smoking, reduces lung-cancer-related mortality; however, uptake of screening has been relatively low. Only around 5% of eligible individuals undergo screening due to factors such as high costs, limited access, and concerns for false positives. Genomic blood tests for cancer screening could be an effective alternative to increase the total number of patients screened and the number of lives saved annually from lung-cancer-related mortality. But current methods suffer from low sensitivity or have focused on diseases other than lung cancer. Interestingly, aberrant DNA methylation has been shown to be associated with lung ctDNA, suggesting that the use of DMRs as a biomarker in blood-based lung cancer screening could increase its sensitivity and utility in early cancer detection.\nIncluding DNA methylation in a machine-learning enabled molecular method for lung cancer screening resulted in a positive correlation between DMR detection and the fraction of ctDNA in the sample. Importantly, the novel, blood-based method for early cancer detection has a 15% increase in sensitivity relative to the leading published method. Consequently, including DNA methylation in blood-based tests for early cancer detection has the potential to drastically improve screening sensitivity, increase cancer screening uptake in high-risk adults, and reduce lung-cancer-related mortality.\nStage of Development:\nClinical - Initial validation\n\nApplications: Early lung cancer detection in high-risk adults, Initial blood-based screening for lung cancer for potential recommendation for image-based screening, Increasing cancer screening uptake and reducing lung-cancer-related mortality.\n\nAdvantages: Uses a blood-based molecular method as opposed to radiologic, Non-invasive relative to image-based screening, Adjustable thresholds enable use as a method for stand-alone screening or initial screening prior to follow-up."
Stanford University,Spectral routers for snapshot multispectral imaging,Docket #: S23-004,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/spectral-routers-snapshot-multispectral-imaging,"Stanford researchers working as part of the E. L. Ginzton Laboratory, an interdisclplinary research lab for applied physics, have developed a new device, called a spectral router, which can separate light into spectral components without loss of photons in a (sub)wavelength size footprint. This spectral router enables single-chip snapshot spectral imaging sensors and systems that are highly (up to ~100%) photon efficient to provide spectral information without sacrificing spatial information. A spectral router in a single-chip snapshot imaging system with N spectral channels can improve photon efficiency N-fold, in a much smaller footprint, compared to a conventional multispectral filter array. While spectral routers benefit all spectral imaging applications, this extremely compact and photon efficient solution can also further increase multispectral imaging use cases by enabling photon-efficient, high-spatial resolution systems on  highly portable platforms (e.g., smart phones, tablets).\nFigure Description:(a) Conventional on-chip solution for single-chip spectral imaging systems based on spectral filter array with photon-inefficient spectral filters which are larger than the wavelength and thus limit the spatial resolution of the captured image, (b) Spectral router providing highly efficient routing of spectral components in a (sub)wavelength footprint without sacrificing spatial resolution in the image, (c) Example spectral router with 6 spectral channels, in a 2 by 3 channel layout, in the visible wavelength range. The optical efficiency of the router can be ideal (~100%) for the 6 channels with negligible (~0%) crosstalk between channels. For comparison, the gray line in the graph shows the maximum theoretical efficiency (=1/6) of a spectral filter array.\nStage of Development\n\nApplications: Spectral imaging and imaging spectroscopy applications including but not limited to:  Bio-medical imaging, microscopy, precision agriculture, food inspection, machine vision, forensics and counterfeit detection, Single-chip spectral imaging systems based on solid state image sensors and (infrared) focal plane arrays, CMOS image sensors, CCD image sensors that can be used in smartphone cameras, security cameras, and automotive cameras.\n\nAdvantages: High (~100%) photon efficiency across spectral channels, Negligible (~0%) crosstalk between spectral channels, Extremely compact (sub)wavelength size to allow spectral imaging without sacrificing spatial resolution at the image plane, Flexible design (spectral shapes, number of channels, channel separations, …), Can operate in many spectral ranges (visible, infrared, …), Standard semiconductor nanolithography processing, including CMOS Image Sensor (CIS) processing."

The system is technologically simpler, more scalable, more reproducible, more accurate, and more flexible than current screening methods.  The method embeds human immune cell suspensions within 3-dimensional hydrogel structures as functionalized immune organoids, dramatically improving reproducibility, immunobiology response accuracy, assay flexibility, and throughput capacity. Antigen compounds, vaccine candidates or adjuvants can be co-embedded along with the cells within the 3-dimensinal structures to construct a miniaturized 3-dimensional artificial lymph node. The resulting solidified suspensions are then distributed in tissue culture plates with a defined supplemented media. For high throughput use, multiplex plates can be configured for surveying culture media for antibody responses, and organoids can be harvested by removal from the plate for flexible readouts such as high dimensional imaging, flow cytometry and DNA/RNA sequencing.   The structures manifest many in vivo immune responses, and can therefore be used to model the complex human immune system.\nStage of Development\nResearch in vitro: Researchers are using tonsil immune organoid arrays to identify immunosuppressive drug effects on vaccine responses.  They continue to tune the larger scale format assay operating characteristics, to test the assay's detection limits and real world applications for compound screening and high dimensional imaging, to optimize growth conditions and define cell parameters for larger scale use, to define detection limits, to explore characteristics for high throughput screening, and to deploy multiple flexible readouts.\n\nApplications: Vaccine and adjuvant candidate screening, especially for seasonal viral illness like flu and COVID19., Immunomodulatory / Immunotoxicity screening of existing, clinically available drugs for adverse vaccine responses., Drug development screening of compound libraries for focused development of new immunomodulatory drugs..\n\nAdvantages: Technological simplicity – no need for complex bioreactor preparation., Accurate - more closely recapitulates in vivo vaccine responses compared with peripheral B cells., Flexible, adaptable - more flexible in input/output. Can be adapted for high throughput imaging, flow cytometry, and many downstream immunological sequencing readouts with minimal modulation., Scalable with reduced variability."
Stanford University,Deriving human induced pluripotent stem cells from pre-exposed fibroblasts,Docket #: S22-495,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/deriving-human-induced-pluripotent-stem-cells-pre-exposed-fibroblasts,"Researchers at Stanford have created human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from adult human dermal fibroblasts exposed to an environmental factor. In proof-of-concept studies, they were exposed to polystyrene (PS), one of the most commonly used plastics and environmental pollutants. Plastic pollution is increasing at an alarming rate, yet the impact of this pollution on human health is poorly understood. Since skin is the most frequently used source for derivation of hiPSCs and in direct contact with pollutants, hiPSCs derived from dermal fibroblasts offer a powerful platform to start to identify molecular biomarkers of environmental pollution in human cells.\nAdult human dermal fibroblasts, used for their reprogramming and derivation of hiPSCs, were exposed to PS. The genetic and epigenetic profiles of both exposed fibroblasts and derived hiPSC were studied, revealing commonly altered genes, signaling circuits, and pathways involved in human diseases. Even when exposed to a low concentration of PS, hiPSCs demonstrated altered DNA methylation and transcriptomic profiles. This strategy for deriving new hiPSC lines can help define the impact of epigenetic memory/mechanisms and environmental pollution on human health, identifying specific cellular responses, and narrowing down the list of candidate biomarkers. The derived cell lines can thus help to decipher the origins of environment-related diseases and offer new therapeutic targets.\nThis strategy can also be applied to study or test new drugs, cosmetic products, chemicals, or any other exposure factor, not just environmental pollutants. It can be used to establish a cell bank that will supply researchers (environmental investigators, clinicians, drug developers) with fibroblasts or cells of other origin pre-exposed to different factors and the derived hiPSCs. Derived new hiPSC lines and differentiated hiPSCs can also be retained and offered for further and more accurate studies.\nStage of Development\nProof of Concept\n\nApplications: Cellular models to identify genetic and epigenetic alterations and changes in signaling circuits associated with exposure to environmental pollutants, new chemicals, and drugs, Cellular models to identify therapeutic targets and biomarkers for human diseases associated with exposure to the above-described factors, Cell bank of exposure models as described above.\n\nAdvantages: New model/strategy for the study of environmental and other exposure impacts on the cellular level, Ability to narrow down and prioritize biomarkers of human health related to the exposure/environment, Ability to illuminate therapeutic targets for environment-related diseases."

Specifically, the task of obtaining a homogenous population of liver cells from human pluripotent stem cells has proven to be challenging. Current methods result in a mixture of liver cells and non-liver cell populations. To remedy this problem, Stanford researchers have developed a new approach based on metabolic selection to create purified human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) derived hepatocytes by selectively killing non-liver cells.\nThe new approach is based on the concept that different cell-types have distinct metabolic requirements to survive, and can thus be killed by withholding specific nutrients. Using this method, the researchers are able to  create essentially homogeneous populations of hPSC-derived hepatocytes, without recourse to surface marker-based cell sorting or other purification schemas. Ultimately, a pure population of hepatocytes cells will be immensely useful for applications in regenerative medicine and disease modeling.\nStage of Development \nPre-clinical: Stanford researchers are performing additional mouse transplantation studies to test whether the human pluripotent stem cell-derived liver cells can engraft long term in the injured mouse liver.\n\nApplications: Purify stem cell-derived liver cells, Purify mixed population of liver and non-liver cells.\n\nAdvantages: Simple, scalable, and inexpensive, Compatible with cells produced by various differentiation methods."

However, aptamers are limited by poor sensitivity. Researchers therefore combined the signaling abilities of an aptamer with the high sensitivity and specificity of a monoclonal antibody by combining the two components with a short DNA linker.\nThis new sensor can detect target molecules at very low concentrations (Kd = ~100 pM) even in complex samples, enabling rapid, direct detection in biofluids or environmental samples without expensive and time-consuming sample preparation. Sensors can track changes in target concentration over time with high temporal resolution (~10 minutes). Sensors are easy to engineer, as they can take advantage of existing antibodies and aptamers without any further engineering. Features like affinity, sensitivity, and temporal response can be rationally tuned by changing the length of the DNA linker or modifying the aptamer sequence.\n\nApplications: Fluorescent or electrochemical signal output, Wearable or implantable biosensors, Point-of-care and at-home diagnostics, Personalized medicine, Wastewater and agricultural monitoring.\n\nAdvantages: Sensitivity superior to traditional DNA aptamers (Kd = ~100 pM), No requirement for a secondary antibody, Preparation-free, direct sensing in complex samples, Continuous sensing of changes in target concentration over time, Temporal resolution of ~10 minutes, Highly modular and tunable."

The approach allows for identification of axon regeneration-associated genes, which are promising therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases.\nAxonopathy is a common early feature of central nervous system (CNS) neurodegenerative diseases, including glaucoma and ALS. which is characterized by axon degeneration followed by progressive neuronal cell body death. The axons of adult CNS neurons do not regenerate spontaneously after degeneration, which causes irreversible neuronal function deficits. There are currently no neural repair therapies. The application of the novel technique is exemplified by the researchers' successful identification of several novel regeneration-associated genes (Anxa2, tPA, Mpp1, ILK, and more) that significantly promote axon regeneration, dramatically protect retinal ganglion cells and optic nerves, and preserves visual function in a clinically relevant model of glaucoma.\nStage of Development \nIn vivo: proof-of-concept demonstration of AAV-mediated expression of several identified genes, including Anxa2, ILK, and Mpp1, for neuroprotection and axon regeneration in mouse glaucoma model.\nRelated Technoloies\nStanford docket 21-363 describes a neuroprotective gene therapy for glaucoma by driving expression of NMNAT2 in retinal ganglion cells\nStanford docket S21-382 describes repurposed neuroprotective agents and a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of glaucoma and other optic neuropathies.\nSee Stanford docket  S19-014 for more on the Hu team's foundational work on neuronal ER stress and AAV-mediated gene therapy strategy.\nStanford docket  S19-013 describes glaucoma animal models based on silicone oil-induced mild/chronic and severe/acute reversible ocular hypertension.\n\nApplications: Identify therapeutic targets for: i) glaucoma and other optic neuropathies ii) ALS iii) Other axonopathies and neurodegenerative diseases, Identifies neural repair targets.\n\nAdvantages: First potential neural repair therapy."
Stanford University,Bacteria-engineered to Elicit Antigen-Specific T-Cells,Docket #: S21-173,Published Application: 20240024380,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/bacteria-engineered-elicit-antigen-specific-t-cells,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a new avenue for stimulating T effector and Treg immune cells in an antigen-specific manner.\nCommensal microbiota have been shown to functionally regulate the innate and adaptive immune systems and must establish distinct niches at barrier sites throughout the human body. To prevent aberrant immune responses to commensal microbiota, Treg cells participate in tissue-specific immune regulation at barrier sites where they typically reside. In contrast, T effector cells generally amplify pro-inflammatory responses in an antigen-specific manner. In another vein, autoimmune diseases are estimated to effect up to 1 in every 10 individuals. Expanding Treg populations in the setting of autoimmune diseases is highly desirable and has shown favorable results in several animal models. However, methods for expanding these specific cells in vivo in a safe and efficacious\nmanner are still elusive.\nStage of Development\nResearch:\nin vivo\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have pioneered a new approach to elicit and expand antigen-specific Tregs and T effector cells. Helicobacter hepaticus bacteria can be engineered to express a heterologous non-native protein or peptide. This peptide or protein could be of interest in an autoimmune disease or a specific cancer, among other things. Subsequently, dendritic cells will then phagocytose the bacteria, digest, and present the heterologous protein or peptide to naïve T-cells. In parallel, Treg-inducing cytokines will be administered to induce differentiation of naïve T-cells into Tregs. Once completed, this process will result in a Treg cell that has a TCR specific for a host antigen of interest.

Stanford University,Method for generating human spiral ganglion neurons,Docket #: S22-419,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/method-generating-human-spiral-ganglion-neurons,"Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are essential for hearing as they transmit electrical signals from the cochlea to the brain. Loss of SGNs causes permanent hearing loss because SGNs do not spontaneously regenerate in humans. Despite their scientific and clinical importance, the developmental, cellular, and molecular features of human SGNs remain poorly characterized due to the limited accessibility to the human inner ear and incomplete phenotypic conversion of stem cells into SGN-like cells in vitro. Unfortunately, a fundamental obstacle in the study of human SGNs is the inability to obtain routine tissue biopsies due to the small size of the cochlea, its complex three-dimensional anatomy, and encasement in dense bone.\nTo overcome this challenge, inventors at Stanford have developed a novel method for generating human spiral ganglion neurons using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to generate functional SGNs via otic neurosensory progenitor cells (ONPs) in vitro. Utilizing the method enables the mimicking of in vivo cell-to-cell signaling occurring during human inner ear development. This is the first comprehensive description of the heterogeneity of human auditory neuronal populations using high-resolution transcriptomic profiling of individual cells, coupled with electrophysiological characterization of the cells' functional diversification. These human neurons offer powerful cellular models to decipher the precise mechanisms underlying hearing disorders and to enable future targeted therapies.\nThe invention offers a novel platform to answer fundamental questions in auditory research and facilitate therapeutic innovation for sensorineural hearing loss. The high-efficiency, monolayer SGN culture protocol could be a reliable source of cells for drug screening. Unlike 3D organoids, the invented method results in 2D cultures that are representative of their in vivo counterparts and provide benefits for easier scale-up, monitoring, functional tests, and quality control in a realistic way, as has already been demonstrated using dissociated mouse SGNs. Finally, this protocol could be used to test potentially regenerative, patient-specific therapies aimed at replacing or repairing human SGNs.\n\nApplications: Therapeutic innovation for sensorineural hearing loss, Understanding of the normal, as well as abnormal, development of the human auditory system, Understanding inherited disorders leading to hearing loss., Drug screening, 2D in vivo cultures for easier scale-up, monitoring, functional tests, and quality control, Regenerative, patient-specific therapies aimed at replacing or repairing human SGNs.\n\nAdvantages: Novel platform to answer fundamental questions in auditory research and facilitate therapeutic innovation for sensorineural hearing loss, 2D cultures for easier scale-up, monitoring, functional tests, and quality control of high-throughput drug screening, First comprehensive description of the heterogeneity of human auditory neuronal populations using high-resolution transcriptomic profiling of individual cells, coupled with electrophysiological characterization of the cells' functional diversification.."

Bacteriophage, viruses that kill bacteria with high specificity, offer an alternative approach to treating infections. However, intravenous or bolus delivery of bacteriophage has not been effective due to lack of local targeting over long times. This invention addresses this challenge by delivering bacteriophage locally with hydrogels in a sustained manner.

Stanford University,Improved Pain Suppression with Targeted Ultrasound,Docket #: S23-109,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/improved-pain-suppression-targeted-ultrasound,"Stanford researchers have developed a method for targeted focused ultrasound application to peripheral nerves to suppress acute pain. This invention can non-invasively concentrate ultrasound waves onto peripheral nerves without impacting surrounding tissue. It uses focused ultrasound waves to block pain fibers for 1-2 weeks with minimal motor fiber blockage, avoiding problems with common pharmaceutical painkillers and traditional 'nerve block' techniques.\nPain after surgery or injury is often moderate-to-severe for 1-2 weeks and the majority of patients have poorly controlled acute pain during this time. Moderate-to-severe acute pain is associated with increased risk of a wide array of worsened health outcomes including developing myocardial ischemia, impaired pulmonary function, ileus, thromboembolism, impaired immune function, infection, and anxiety. Opioids are commonly prescribed to treat pain and they do well at controlling dull, burning, or rest pain, but don't do as well at controlling sharp or movement pain. Traditional 'nerve blocks' use inject local anesthetics near nerves; these local anesthetic drugs block all nerve fibers, not just pain fibers, including motor and non-pain sensory fibers, which can increase the risk of a patient falling and prevents early participation in physical therapy. There is therefore a significant need for a non-invasive, non-drug based pain therapy which can block acute pain for 1-2 weeks after surgery or injury without the risk of major side effects. This invention can non-invasively and reversibly inhibit peripheral nerves with no risk of serious side effects and has the potential to greatly improve the standard of care for patients managing acute pain.\nStage of Development\nPre-clinical, proof of concept in animals\nRelated Technologies:\nStanford docket 17-430: Acute and Chronic Pain Suppression through Targeted Peripheral Nerve Application of Focused Ultrasound\n\nApplications: Acute pain management, Chronic pain management, Pain management after surgery and trauma.\n\nAdvantages: The only current focused ultrasound device for peripheral nervous system neuromodulation to suppress acute pain, Alternative to opioid treatment and traditional nerve blocks, Non-invasive, Easy to administer, Optimized nerve fiber selectivity, No risk of serious side effects, Can block pain fibers for different durations."

Although irradiation does not cause immediate symptoms or pain, children placed in an unfamiliar and isolated setting for an extended amount of time may feel anxious and find remaining still difficult. To ensure that the procedure is not traumatizing nor prolonged, pediatric patients are often anesthetized. Some patients who need multiple consecutive sessions may even be anesthetized daily, putting them at risk of brain damage and subjecting them to overnight fasting, invasive procedures, and increased treatment cost and time.\nThe proposed audio-visual assisted therapeutic ambiance system can significantly reduce the pediatric patient's anxiety and need for anesthesia during radiation procedures. This system includes a wireless projector, a speaker, a mount, and a radiotransparent plastic projection screen. The screen can be placed between the patient and the radiation equipment without interfering with the procedure. The patient can be sedated while watching pre-selected videos and communicating with the providers on the system, reducing the need for anesthesia.\nFigure Caption: Audio-visual assisted therapeutic ambiance in radiotherapy system (Figure 1 from Balazy et al., 2020).\n\nApplications: Radiation therapy (radiotherapy) for cancer treatment, Radiation imaging (radiography), X-ray imaging, Computed tomography (CT).\n\nAdvantages: Reduces procedure time and complications., Reduces need for, and cost related to, anesthesia., Improves quality of life of patients.."

The markers are sensitive and specific to human stool, and highly abundant in human stool and wastewater samples. Using 15 wastewater and 236 stool samples, researchers found that the new invention targeting ToBRFV was more robust and yielded a greater signal compared to the current gold standard, PMMoV.

Stanford University,Large Scale Genomic Editing and Tracking using CRISPR-based Single-Cell Barcoding,Docket #: S19-349,"Published Application: WO2022226085, Published Application: 20240209447",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/large-scale-genomic-editing-and-tracking-using-crispr-based-single-cell-barcoding,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed a scalable, single-cell barcoding system and method for genomic editing and tracking using cas12a-based compressive molecular probes. Human diseases involve millions or even billions of cells and complex pathophysiological processes, yet current laboratory methods are insufficient as they can only profile a small number of cells and are extremely labor- and cost-intensive. This severely limits our ability to systematically modify and edit the molecules within a cell to understand their function, and consequently limits our understanding of cellular and disease biology. To address this challenge, this novel barcoding system, based on CRISPR gene editing technology, leverages cas12a-based molecular probes to either edit or measure molecules within a cell, allowing for massive scale cell measurements at low cost. The probes are designed under a computational compression principle, similar to compressing an image on a computer to save space. The compressive molecular probes enable at least a two orders-of-magnitude (20-fold to 100-fold) boost to the number of cells that can be edited or measured. Thus, it could be used to scale up gene-editing and profiling methods.\nThe cas12a-based barcoding system has been tested and validated, enabling the recovery of single-cell lineages and transcriptional profiles in melanoma cells as well as identifying a drug that can play a protective role in severe COVID-19 based on high-throughput screening and clinical datasets. These findings demonstrate the utility of this barcoding technology for large-scale profiling of single-cell gene expression, and it could further be used for genome-scale compressive CRISPR editing. The system is a transformative new way to collect large biomedical datasets at high-resolution, which are critical for understanding complex diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders.\nStage of Development\nProof of Concept / Computational\nFigure:\nFigure description: An illustration of an exemplary design of a barcode system, in which a single CRISPR RNA (crRNA) array with two RNA guides (G1/G2) could be processed to edit two target sites within a cellular barcode sequence.

Lithium metal offers a theoretical specific capacity up to tenfold that of graphite. This solution addresses a longstanding challenge, ensuring stable cycling of metallic lithium even under high current densities and realistic cell conditions.\nTraditionally, metallic lithium has struggled with cyclic instability at elevated current densities, limiting its application in high-power scenarios. However, the CF-based hybrid lithium-ion/lithium-metal anode technology achieves a remarkable >99% Coulombic Efficiency (CE) at 12 mA/cm² (4 mAh/cm²) and >99.5% CE at 16 mA/cm² (2.5 mAh/cm²) with a standard carbonate electrolyte. Furthermore, in comparison to the prevailing graphite anode material, the CF demonstrates a two-fold specific capacity at low current densities (2 mA/cm²) and an astounding four-fold specific capacity at high current densities (>10 mA/cm²). The cyclic stability at these elevated currents surpasses that of graphite, marking a significant leap forward in lithium-ion battery technology.\nIn a market dominated by graphite, this carbon flower anode material represents a transformative leap forward. With twice the specific capacity at low current densities and four times the capacity at high current densities, coupled with unmatched cyclic stability, it stands poised to redefine the future of high-performance lithium-ion battery technology.\n\nApplications: High-power electric vehicles, Grid-scale energy storage, Portable electronics.\n\nAdvantages: Greater longevity and reliability in demanding applications, Rapid charging, Lightweight."

The novel TG2/LRP-1 pathway can be hijacked to deliver antigens, pharmacologic agents, or imaging tools into macrophages and dendritic cells or to promote lysosomal degradation of pathologically important extracellular or cell-surface proteins in a targeted manner.\nA prototypical class of molecular glues are mimics of gluten peptides designed to selectively inactivate and degrade extracellular TG2 in the small intestine of celiac disease patients. TG2 is not only pathogenically important in celiac disease, but it also elicits auto-antibodies in patients with this autoimmune disorder. By inactivating catalytically active TG2 in the patient's small intestinal mucosa and also eliminating the protein from this environment, it is expected that both the T cell and B cell responses to dietary gluten will be controllable by this new generation of oral TG2 inhibitors. Some members of this class of molecular glues also have optically active probes attached to them and are therefore expected to have theranostic utility.\nStage of Development\nin vitro and in vivo\nFigure:\n\nApplications: TG2 inhibitors and degraders for celiac disease therapy, Imaging probes for subclinical disease activity in celiac disease patients, Antigen delivery into macrophages and dendritic cells, Lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs) for inactivating extracellular proteins and cell surface receptors.\n\nAdvantages: New class of TG2 inhibitors, Bifunctional molecules capable of  intracellular delivery of any agent that can be linked to a peptide."

Poor efficacy and persistence have hindered the success of CAR-T cell immunotherapy in many patients and tumor types. To address these challenges, this method adds inosine to culture media, resulting in changes in CAR-T cell phenotype and metabolic features. Supplemented CAR-T cells were shown to use inosine as a carbon source, relieving tumor-imposed metabolic restrictions on T cells and leading to increased anti-tumor potency in vitro. The supplemented CAR-T cells can further improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive T cell therapies in vivo, prolonging survival in mouse models of solid tumors unable to metabolize inosine. This method can be used during CAR-T cell manufacturing or in further immunotherapy research and development efforts to improve CAR-T cell function.\nStage of Development:\nPrototype\n\nApplications: This method can be used by stakeholders with an interest in improving CAR-T cell efficacy:\n\nAcademic researchers\nBiotech companies\nPharmaceutical companies\nCell manufacturing centers, Academic researchers, Biotech companies, Pharmaceutical companies, Cell manufacturing centers.\n\nAdvantages: Easy method implementation, Improved anti-tumor potency of CAR-T cells, Improved persistence of CAR-T cells in vivo, Improved efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive T cell therapies."
Stanford University,A Method to Enhance CAR T Efficacy through Adenosine Deaminase Overexpression,Docket #: S21-181,Published Application: WO2023034742,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/method-enhance-car-t-efficacy-through-adenosine-deaminase-overexpression,"Stanford Scientists have developed an innovative approach that enhances the antitumor efficacy of CAR T cells by overexpressing Adenosine Deaminase 1 (ADA), an enzyme responsible for metabolizing adenosine into inosine, to attenuate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.\nAlthough promising, CAR T cell therapy efficacy in solid tumors is limited by hostile tumor microenvironments, limited CAR T persistence, and lack of tumor killing. Extracellular adenosine contributes to the hostile tumor microenvironment by binding the adenosine A2a receptor on immune cells. Blocking A2aR or enhancing ADA-mediated adenosine metabolism to inosine protects T cells from adenosine-mediated immunosuppression. Stanford scientists showed that human CAR T cells are also susceptible to adenosine-mediated immunosuppression. They developed an approach where they overexpressed ADA in exhausted and non-exhausted CAR T cells leading to a higher frequency of stem cell-like memory T cell effectors, and a simultaneous decrease of exhausted subpopulations. Both antigen-driven proliferation and effector function of CAR T cells also significantly improved after ADA overexpression. Therefore, overexpression of adenosine deaminase in CAR T cells is a novel and efficient way to evade immunosuppression.\nStage of Development\nResearch – in vitro\n\nApplications: CAR T immunotherapy, especially for solid tumors.\n\nAdvantages: Brand new approach, Can increase resistance to immunosuppression and improve potency of existing cancer immunotherapies against solid tumors."

In nature, this search is based on random mutation and recombination, but using this same approach for directed evolution of proteins in the laboratory imposes a considerable experimental burden. Indeed, current approaches are limited as high-throughput evolutionary screens, that rely on random guessing or brute-force search, often devote substantial effort to interrogating weakly active or nonfunctional proteins. There is therefore a need for more efficient and effective methods of generating protein variants using directed evolution.\nStage of Development\nResearch -\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed methods for predicting improved antibody variants.

Current organoid construction involves resuspending aggregated cells in commercially available extracellular matrix (ECM) mimics, rather than from a single cell. Due to this property of their construction, it is difficult to determine whether an organoid phenotype has arisen from the stochasticity of the deposited cell population, or from an intrinsic property of individual cells. Single organoid phenotypic characterization remains a challenge.\nStage of Development\nResearch - in vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have identified a new microwell based technique for the high-throughput quantification of image-based parameters at single organoid resolution. This method can be used to phenotypically monitor thousands of organoids in parallel. Phenotypes such as organoid growth rates, migration behavior, and fluorescently labeled protein expression and localization are all parameters that can be assessed through this pipeline. Once profiled, organoids can be retrieved from their microwells for sequencing and molecular profiling to determine the genomic or proteomic origin of the organoid's phenotypic state.\nTechnology Reference Nos.\n\nApplications: High-throughput drug screening of patient-derived human organoids, Characterization of genetic mutations of interest in parallel, Elucidation of genetic mutations that contribute to tumor microenvironments.\n\nAdvantages: Organoid profiling is not restricted to bulk averages for parameters such as growth rates or division times., Does not require specialized instrumentation and is therefore an easy addition to existing cell culture workflows., Organoids can be generated from single cells rather than aggregated cell populations.."

Of these, phosphorylation is one of the most prevalent post-translational modifications which involves the addition of a phosphate to a protein substrate by kinases. This phosphate group can also be removed via phosphatases. Phosphorylation dynamics are a key regulatory mechanism in cells and is essential for cellular function. Understanding these dynamics is integral to the study of cellular processes in both health and disease. However, additional methods for the study of these dynamics in a high-throughput manner are needed.\nStage of Development\nResearch -\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed the novel method MRBLE:Dephos. This method utilizes microfluidically produced hydrogel beads encoded with radiometric combinations of lanthanide nanophosphors (MRBLES). More specifically, this method quantifies binding of a fluorescently labeled protein or chemical group to 96 bead-bound peptides in parallel. The inventors have extended the MRBLES technique into the dephosphorylation space by producing a library of 96 Ser and Thr peptides on MRBLES with basic, acidic, or hydrophobic amino acids surrounding the phosphorylation site.

Therefore, it is advantageous to be able to screen protein-protein interactions in an unbiased and high-throughput manner. Multiplexed microbead assays allow for massively multiplexed high throughput evaluation of a myriad of biological proteomic interactions. However, these assays often have a limited possible coding space with fluorescently encoded beads.\nStage of Development\nResearch -\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a method of screening that modulates protein-protein interactions.

Fully synthetic opioids such as fentanyl are even more potent than traditional opioids and have further fueled the opioid epidemic. Both synthetic and traditional opioids act as agonists against the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). Considering the far-reaching socioeconomic impacts of the opioid epidemic, new pain relief therapeutics are needed to quell further morbidity and mortality. In another vein, it has been shown that cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) are essential components of pain modulation.\nStage of Development\nResearch -\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have discovered and characterized novel modulators of MOR and CB1. These compounds have the potential to act on the same biological systems as opioids with potentially reduced addictive properties. Additionally, these compounds have potential roles in treating opioid overdose. Some compounds disclosed in this patent are positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and some are negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of MOR.  Rather than acting as direct agonists and binding to the binding site of these receptors, they bind at alternative locations on the protein to effect function. This provides a distinct benefit of these compounds over traditional or synthetic opioids in that molecules that bind at allosteric sites can signal more specifically through the MOR or CB1 to avoid off-target effects, including potential psychoactive effects.\nTechnology Reference Nos.\nCZ Biohub ref. no.

This stem cell technology provides tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) to the immune system that activate both specific cellular immunity and humoral immune responses to prevent tumor growth and/or eradicate tumor cells. As this invention was genetically engineered to be hypoallergenic and also immunogenic, it only provokes anti-cancer immunity without inducing any undesired graft-verse-host diseases. Besides, unlike other cancer immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapies or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, hypoallergenic-immunogenic based vaccine does not cause any immune related adverse events (irAEs) or organ-specific inflammatory side effects. This invention paves the way for the production of an allogeneic iPSC therapy to treat or prevent cancer.\nIn addition, common drawbacks of individualized cell therapy include manufacturing time, lack of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions, and high cost.

Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is a genetic disorder of pancreas and beta-cell function characterized by the failure to suppress insulin secretion in the setting of hypoglycemia, resulting in severe hypoglycemia that can cause brain damage or death if inadequately treated. Roughly 50% of HI patients can manage their condition with the existing drugs diazoxide or octreotide, but the other 50% must undergo a pancreatectomy, leading to long-term surgical complications. Thus, there is a large unmet need for patients with congenital HI that are not candidates for current drug therapies. This newly developed insulin receptor antagonist may provide a solution, providing better efficacy and fewer complications than the standard of care for HI. The antagonist has been shown to successfully reduce the activation of the insulin receptor and downstream signaling in vitro in the low nanomolar range.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cis-regulatory elements (CREs) can affect gene expression and contribute to disease mechanisms, but the majority of them are not well understood. Current methods to study CREs use CRISPRi to perturb them as a whole, which neglects the influence of individual SNPs on disease-relevant gene expression. This new method can be used to combine precision genome editing with a targeted scDNA-scRNA-seq readout to reliably link variable genomic editing outcomes with disease-relevant gene expression. Another potential application involves the profiling of patient tumor samples for mutational status and associated gene expression. Understanding the driving effects and gene expression changes that are associated with individual mutations could yield better predictive treatment strategies for cancer patients.\nStage of Development\n\nApplications: Linking genomic information to transcriptomic signatures, Characterizing patient samples for mutational status and associated gene expression, Better predictions for treatment of cancer patients, Drive mechanistic insights of disease-relevant eQTL mappings, Enables performance of lineage tracing analysis using endogenous gDNA or mtDNA loci.\n\nAdvantages: Directly reads out the loci of interest, Targeted, High sensitivity, High-throughput, Cost effective."
Stanford University,The Nano-complex: Revolutionizing Cancer Radiotherapy for Enhanced Tumor Elimination and Long-term Immune Surveillance,Docket #: S23-139,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/nano-complex-revolutionizing-cancer-radiotherapy-enhanced-tumor-elimination-and-long,"This invention is an innovative breakthrough in cancer radiotherapy, offering a cutting-edge solution to address the challenges of radio-resistant and immunosuppressive tumors. This technology involves a gold cluster-based nanocomplex serving as both the radiosensitizer and a gene vector carrying siRNA, specifically targeting the tumor marker protein Galectin-1.\nCancer treatments often face the daunting obstacle of radio-resistance and immunosuppression, hindering the effectiveness of conventional therapies. Additionally, distant metastasis remains a critical concern, impacting long-term patient survival rates. This technology is designed to autonomously accumulate within tumor and metastatic niches, delivering its siRNA payload to knock down the radio-resistant Galectin-1 protein. Simultaneously, the gold atoms within the nano-complex generate cell-killing reactive oxygen species upon radiation treatment, promoting efficient tumor elimination. To further boost the systemic immune response, the gold nano-complex facilitates enhanced stereotactic body radiotherapy, leading to increased immunogenic cell death. Additionally, the clearance of immunosuppressive Galectin-1 supports long-term immune surveillance, preventing distant metastasis and improving overall survival rates. In tumor mouse models, the gold nano-complex showcased superior outcomes compared to radiation therapy alone or in combination with antibodies or inhibitors against Galectin-1, or cisplatin. Its multifaceted effects lead to prolonged survival rates and efficient prevention of metastasis, promising a new era in cancer treatment.\nIn addition to Galectin-1, the siRNA cargo could be switched to downregulate various tumor-supportive protein targets.\nBenefiting from the specific chemical design, the nanocomplex could be gradually cleared out from living bodies through urine and feces, thus circumventing the chronic toxicity problem confronted by plasmonic gold nanoparticles which are not possible for in vivo excretion.\nThis nanocomplex has a portion of free amine groups on the surface, providing conjugation sites for further on-demand modifications.\nStage of Development\nResearch - In vivo\n\nApplications: Commercial radiosensitizers, Gene therapy drugs, Clinical radiotherapy, Cancer treatment.\n\nAdvantages: Better bioavailability in primary and distant tumors, Excellent pharmacokinetics elicits long blood circulation time, Superior efficacy against head and neck cancer compared to cisplatin, Better in vivo clearance than plasmonic gold nanoparticles, Good gene delivery vector for delivery of siRNA and in vivo gene knockdown."
Stanford University,HyTEC: Hybrid Tissue Engineering Construct,Docket #: S20-447,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/hytec-hybrid-tissue-engineering-construct,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a porous biologics-loaded multimaterial construct, called Hybrid Tissue Engineering Construct (HyTEC), with applications in regenerative medicine and therapeutic delivery. The new strategy enables incorporation of biologics (e.g., biomolecules, drugs or cells) through a uniform thick hydrogel layer onto porous scaffolds while retaining interconnected open pores, or onto non-porous implants. Existing coating techniques, including layer-by-layer coating and adhesive coating, have been used to load biomolecules on the surface of porous implants. However, these techniques restrict loading to a limited amount of biomolecules. Loading a large or tunable dose of biomolecules on implants is particularly important since the effective dose of biomolecules is often high in vivo and could be different for various indications. For the HyTEC proof of concept, the researchers loaded model proteins and cells on 3D printed biodegradable polycaprolactone and ?-tricalcium phosphate (PCL-TCP) as a model polymer-ceramic porous scaffold, a PCL-TCP rod as a model polymer-ceramic non-porous implant, and stainless steel needles as a model metal.\nRelated Technology\nStanford docket S20-459: Learn how the HyTEC platform is being used to develop a bioactive intramedullary implant for reconstruction of bone defect, deformity and nonunion.\n\nApplications: HyTEC is used for delivery of therapeutics including cells and/or biomolecules along with a structural support for applications in regenerative medicine.

The core scaffolds can be porous/non-porous and degradable/non-degradable. The hydrogels can be interpenetrating networks of a physically crosslinked gel and a covalently crosslinked gel. Small molecular weight crosslinkers can be added to the hydrogel to increase the crosslink density. The bioactive materials include drugs and growth factors (such as BMP-2, PDGF and IGF-1), which are loaded into the hydrogel and exhibit a tunable or sustained-release pattern.\nFigure\nSchematic representation of the bioactive IM implant device for bone healing under three conditions.

Stanford University,Chimeric pseudoislets development method that retains beta cell features,Docket #: S22-359,Published Application: WO2024118731,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/chimeric-pseudoislets-development-method-retains-beta-cell-features,"Mature pancreatic islets are the gold standard for transplantation-based approaches for islet replacement in type 1 and type 3c diabetes mellitus (T1D and T3cD), but this feature is offset by the scarcity of human cadaveric pancreas donors. Thus, global efforts are directed to develop replacement islets from renewable sources like human stem cell lines. Despite progress in this area, stem cell-derived replacement islets (SCRIs) lack functional maturation, and recent work has identified molecular, signaling and genetic features of this incomplete development. This includes evidence for GPCR-based signaling between islet cells during fetal development, and expression of crucial factors like the transcriptional regulators in normal human islet beta cell maturation. Islet development in humans and other vertebrates involves aggregation of individual islet cells into multicellular islets to produce heterogeneous clusters of beta, alpha, and delta cells, and other non-islet cell types. Thus, from their birth, interactions between islet cells likely guide islet development. However, the mechanisms of intra-islet signaling to foster human islet development and maturation remain poorly characterized.\nTo address this knowledge gap, inventors at Stanford have exploited the use of pseudoislets to mix SCRI cells and native human islet cells to create mixed chimeras. By using molecular and electrophysiological assays, they showed that exposure of SCRI beta cells to native islet cells in such in vitro cell mixtures substantially enhances their molecular and functional maturation. The invention disperses cells from stem-cell-derived protocols, and mixes these with dispersed bona fide islet cells from adult donors (human or pig). They are then cultured briefly before being re-isolated into the stem cell-derived progeny resembling islet beta-cells. When re-isolated, these show improved features including production of maturity markers and improved function. These pseudoislets have been demonstrated to function and be transplantable in diabetic animals. The invention identifies a process to provide crucial signals for islet maturation and can be applied for development of replacement islet beta cells or other islet cell types.\n\nApplications: Stem cell-derived replacement islets for diabetes, Renewable human beta cells.\n\nAdvantages: Retains key features of native human beta cells, including SIX2 and SIX3 production that stimulate beta function and specialization, Improved features including production of maturity markers and improved function, Biocompatible and transplantable in vivo."
Stanford University,One Gram Penny-Sized Wireless EEG Recording Patch for Long-term Mental Health Monitoring,Docket #: S21-348,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/one-gram-penny-sized-wireless-eeg-recording-patch-long-term-mental-health-monitoring,"Technology Reference\nCZ Biohub SF ref. no. CZB-229S\nStanford ref. no. S21-348\nResearchers at Stanford have developed a wearable patch that allows for continuous mental health monitoring via electroencephalogram (EEG) recording.\nEEG technology was developed during the advent of neuroscience nearly a century and a half ago. EEG technology works by recording and analyzing surface electrical signals on more than a dozen sites on the human head. These signals correspond to electrical impulses sent by groups of neurons in the cortex, which is the outermost layer of the brain. In the modern day, EEG is used to diagnose many neurological conditions including epilepsy, sleep disorders, and other psychiatric conditions. While very useful in medical practice, EEG technology has drawbacks, including the use of heavy or bulky wires to deploy multiple electrodes. This caveat makes the use of EEG for long-term neurological monitoring impractical using currently available technology due to discomfort caused by bulky equipment.\nStage of Development\nResearch -\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a lightweight, wearable patch that can record EEG signals. This patch contains one or more electrodes that record electrical signals produced by neurons in the cortex. The patch also contains an analog digital converter (ADC) to record the signals picked up by the electrodes. Subsequently, the ADC then passes along these signals to a digital controller which is configured to encode EEG data into a single-bit series so it can be transmitted effectively. Finally, the patch then transmits signals through a radio frequency (RF) transmitter to an external receiver where they can be analyzed.\n\nApplications: Long-term monitoring of numerous neurological and mental health conditions by EEG, This invention can enable further research into recordable electrical patterns detectable by EEG that may provide additional diagnostic methods for neurological or mental health conditions..\n\nAdvantages: Lightweight, weighing only a single gram as well as relatively small (approximately the size of a penny), Patch format allows this technology to be wearable, which in turn allows long-term monitoring with little quality of life disruption to patients as compared to currently available technology which is bulky and requires wires.."
Stanford University,High-capacity Lentiviral Vectors,Docket #: S21-394,Published Application: WO2023212396,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/high-capacity-lentiviral-vectors,"Technology Reference\nCZ Biohub SF ref. no. CZB-230S\nStanford ref. no. S21-394\nResearchers at Stanford have developed new lentiviral vectors that are able to deliver more genetic information than currently available vectors, aiding in the development of gene therapy.\nGene therapy is one of the most promising therapeutic avenues in translational medicine. This method involves the genetic engineering of cells in living humans to replace dysfunctional or pathogenic versions of genes. Several methods have been proposed for delivering gene therapy in patients, one of which is lentiviral vectors (LVVs). Lentiviruses are a group of retroviruses that can insert parts of their genetic material into a host cell's genome, including non-dividing cells. While LVVs have many advantages for use in gene therapy, one caveat of this approach is the limited capacity of these vectors. LVVs have approximately an 8-12 kilobase (kb) payload, which limits their delivery capacity to 1-2 genes. This physical limitation attenuates LVVs effectiveness in clinical gene therapy settings in which a larger payload capacity is needed to resolve genetic mutations.\nStage of Development\nResearch -\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have devised a strategy to produce LVVs with roughly double the payload capacity of those currently available. Wild-type LVVs have two identical or nearly identical gRNAs. However, the full capacity of these gRNAs was not able to be utilized due to dimerization interactions between the two gRNAs that result in dimer linkage structure that is integral to viral packaging. The inventors have designed LVV structures that allow for the combining of the two gRNAs such that interactions between like-gRNAs that would form homodimers are thermodynamically favored and stabilized, while interactions between unlike gRNAs that would form heterodimers are not thermodynamically favored and stabilized. Thus, these LVVs can form dimer linkage structures needed for viral packaging (homodimers) while avoiding heterodimers that would disrupt distinct sequences meant to be delivered as a payload into the genomes of human cells.\n\nApplications: Use of increased-capacity LVVs for gene therapy in vivo, Use of increased-capacity LVVs as research tools.\n\nAdvantages: Roughly double the payload capacity of LVVs used under current methods, Increased payload capacity makes these LVVs for broad use in a myriad of biomedical applications that require more than 1-2 genes to be modified.."

CZB-231S\nStanford ref. no. S21-400\nResearchers at Stanford have developed a new microparticle vaccine scaffold for the development of immunogenic subunit vaccines.\nVaccines are one of the most important biomedical advances of the 20th century. Protein vaccines, often referred to as subunit vaccines, have proved to be a particularly useful vaccine strategy. Subunit vaccines have been licensed for the prevention of infectious diseases such as HPV, hepatitis B, and influenza. To assist immunogenicity, subunit vaccines are often administered with adjuvants, carrier proteins or nanoparticles. While these co-administered factors often help with immunogenicity, they often create problems for the scalability of these vaccines.\nStage of Development\nResearch -\nin vivo\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a new scaffolding method for eliciting immunogenicity in subunit vaccines. Specifically, the inventors devised strategies for the purification and conjugation of peptidoglycan (PGN) microparticles from several bacterial strains. PGN is easily purifiable, naturally immunogenic, and readily biodegradable, making it an ideal candidate as a vaccine scaffold. This system uses optimized Staphylococcus aureus PGN microparticles containing azido-D-alanine which is highly manipulatable and creates strong conjugations to immunogens of interest. Furthermore, these PGN microparticles conjugated to protein subunits yielded immunogenic responses similar to those of conventional carrier proteins such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). When PGN microparticles were conjugated to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV2, this subunit vaccine was shown to produce comparable neutralizing antibody titers to those produced by KLH-conjugated RBD, demonstrating the effectiveness of this novel vaccine scaffold.\n\nApplications: Novel protein scaffold for subunit vaccines.\n\nAdvantages: PGN is readily biodegradable while maintaining robust immunogenicity., PGN microparticles are highly stable and comprise a scalable subunit vaccine conjugation platform."
Stanford University,Chemically modified AAVs,Docket #: S21-280,Published Application: WO2024129990,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/chemically-modified-aavs,"Stanford researchers have developed chemically modified AAV vectors through an unnatural amino acid substitution on the capsid surface for post-production vector engineering through biorthogonal copper-free click chemistry.\nAdeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are commonly used for in vivo gene therapy. However a major challenge has remained limited targeting to a specific cell type or tissue. To combat this issue, Stanford researchers have developed chemically modified AAV vectors which display an unnatural amino acid on the capsid surface. As a proof of concept, Stanford researchers used an azido-lysine as the unnatural amino acid displayed on the capsid. The azido (N3) group allows for a simple click chemistry reaction with any molecule that contains a dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) chemical group.

Lymphatic injury caused LEC S1P-S1PR1 signaling reduction. These changes collectively induce P-selectin expression on LECs resulting in CD4 T cell overactivation. Image courtesy the Nicolls Lab.\nThe lab induced lymphedema in mice by surgically ligating the tail lymphatics. Lymphedematous dermal tissue was assessed for S1P signaling and animals were treated with a monoclonal antibody specific to P-selectin to assess efficacy in reducing lymphedema and T cell activation.

(A?) is a key protein involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A key property of A? that is now believed to be at the core of its toxicity in AD is its ability to form soluble, toxic oligomers. Targeting such oligomers remains a promising avenue for AD therapeutic development. It has been found that 1:1 equimolar LL-37/A?40 mixtures are totally prevented from forming A? fibrils, while lower relative molar amounts of LL-37 slow the kinetics of fibril formation; and in this patent, a synthetic peptoid mimic of LL-37 is also shown to bind A?.\nIt has also become clear that sporadic AD (not resulting from a unique familial predisposition to disease) is either caused by or accompanied by the occurrence of polymicrobial brain infections and dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Certain oral pathogens that are associated with dementia—including Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG), Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) and Candida albicans—can be killed or inactivated by the LL-37 peptide, which is produced by the human innate immune system, as well as by peptoid mimics of LL-37 described in this patent.\nAlthough A?:LL-37 interactions offer an interesting starting point in the development of new therapeutic approaches that block A? aggregation and toxicity, the relatively complex, poorly understood, pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects of LL-37, as well as its relatively high molecular weight (~4500 g/mol, 37 amino acids) and extreme vulnerability to cleavage by proteases, are substantially disadvantageous features from the standpoint of using the peptide as an exogenous AD therapeutic. Thus, a biostable peptoid mimic of LL-37 is more promising.\nTechnology\nIt was recently discovered that certain peptoid mimics of LL-37 share the same anti-amyloid activity of the peptide, while also exhibiting potent antimicrobial and antiviral activity against both P. gingivalis, HSV-1, and C. albicans. Thus, these peptoids have the potential to be developed as antimicrobial treatments that may also serve as anti-amyloid treatments.\nFigure:\n\nApplications: Therapeutic or prophylactic treatments for Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nAdvantages: Leverages recently discovered aspects of A? amyloid formation, A?:LL-37 interactions and A?:peptoid interactions, Simultaneously reduces A? amyloid loads and addresses the polymicrobial brain infections that frequently accompany AD."

Conducting oxides (TCOs), in particular Indium tin oxide (ITO), are pivotal for manufacturing of electronic devices, photovoltaics and solar cells. However, the manufacturing techniques remain time-intensive and low-throughput for large-scale production of TCOs via traditional vacuum-based deposition (i.e., sputtering).\nThe scientists at Stanford developed a novel open-air and scalable TCO synthesis technique that is time-efficient, highly tunable, and environmentally friendly. The chloride-free combustion synthesis uses an open-air ultrasonic spray or other solution casting technique to deposit the coating, and then anneals rapidly to generate an amorphous or crystalline oxide depending on the curing temperature. Then, an open-air plasma is used to tune the film conductivity. This method gives high throughput, requires low temperature deposition for amorphous oxide generation, and simultaneously achieves high conductivity. This technique significantly reduces the cost of fabrication of TCO and improves the efficiency of production without sacrificing for its conductivity.\nStage of Development\nProof of Concept\nRelated Technologies from Dauskardt Lab:\nStanford Docket - S23-173 Open-air, rapid plasma annealing of solution deposited solid-state electrolytes for lithium batteries\nStanford Docket - S23-073 Fast and efficient method to produce highly ordered, mesoporous, metal oxide thin films from solution combustion synthesis\nStanford Docket - S23-234 t-Butyl ester-containing complexing agents for ultra-low temperature, solution processable metal oxide formation via combustion\n\nApplications: As an improvement to the present thin film conducting oxides, such as thin film conductors, OLEDS, photovoltaics, plasma display, dielectrics, and other consumer electronics, As infrared mirrors for window treatment to improve heating and cooling capacity, As electrodes in thin film solar cells.\n\nAdvantages: Fully open-air fabrication process, Time-efficient, low-cost manufacturing technique, In situ production process, Free of corrosive halide by-products."

The researchers found that cholesteatoma tissue fluoresces under both 405 nm and 450 nm illumination, while mucosa tissue does not. They can utilize this signature to design an imaging system for surgical guidance.\nCholesteatomas are often asymptomatic and are difficult to detect, but if left untreated can erode adjacent bony structures, leading to severe complications such as brain abscesses, meningitis, facial nerve paralysis, and hearing loss. Cholesteatomas are treated by surgery, but frequently recur due to incomplete removal because of the difficulty of accurately visualizing the bounds of the lesion. This imaging system can distinguish between cholesteatoma and mucosa and similarly colored lesions and could help surgeons to more completely remove cholesteatomas.\nStage of Development\nFigure:\nFigure description: Cholesteatoma imaging device\nImage credit: Journal of Biomedical Optics, Vol. 28, Issue 6, (2023). https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JBO.28.6.066003\n\nApplications: Cholesteatoma surgery.\n\nAdvantages: Helps identify cholesteatoma at surgical site, Distinguishes cholesteatoma from mucosa."

An ultrafast scintillator can largely improve the coincidence timing window (CTR) and allow for better signal localization. Current state-of-the-art scintillators have decay constants of 200ns-1000ns. Although there are some scintillators like BaF2  which have ultrafast decay constants, they are impractical due to low radiative efficiency. To address this challenge, the inventors have successfully designed and optimized fabrication of tunable, purcell enhanced metamaterial scintillators made of alkaline rare-earth fluoride nanoparticles with decay times of 10ps.

This technology can operate at low voltage which makes it safe to use on the human body.\nOne aspect of this invention is a tri-layer dielectric stack that can reduce the driving voltage of an intrinsically stretchable transistor. The tri-layer dielectric boosts capacitance and greatly improves dielectric strength. Current technologies for intrinsically stretchable organic electronics require high operation voltage, which results in safety issues and high power consumption. Previous stretchable transistors have also had a tradeoff between high capacitance and high transistor performance, while this technology includes both.\nAnother aspect of this invention is a solid-state synaptic transistor. The researchers used the synaptic transistor to fabricate an all-solid-state, stretchable synaptic transistor array which maintained performance under 50% strain. Previous synaptic transistors have included either liquid or gel components, creating instability, or rigid materials, preventing the technology from conforming to tissue. This array also demonstrated water resistance, which could allow it to be used for medical purposes.\nStage of Development\nStanford News\n""""Soft 'e-skin' generates nerve-like impulses that talk to the brain"""" (May 18, 2023)\nFigure:\nFigure description: E-skin developed in the Bao lab capable of running at low voltage\nImage credit: Jiancheng Lai and Weichen Wang of Bao Research Group at Stanford University\n\nApplications: Low-voltage driven soft electronics for wearable devices, Bio-interface and neuromorphic devices developments.\n\nAdvantages: Tri-layer dielectric:, Reduces the driven-voltage of stretchable transistors for improved safety and lower power consumption, Low operation voltage and high carrier mobility, Record-low subthreshold swing for stretchable transistor, Improved dielectric capacitance and strength, Synaptic transistor:, All solid materials for more water resistance, Improved environmental stability, High stretchability without any liquid or gel components."
Stanford University,GENERATION OF A NEEDLESHAPED BEAM FOR EXTENDED DEPTH OF FOCUS OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY,Docket #: S21-067,"Published Application: WO2022187646, Published Application: 20230384609",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/generation-needleshaped-beam-extended-depth-focus-optical-coherence-tomography,"Technology Reference\nCZ Biohub ref. no. CZB-204S-PC\nStanford ref. no. S21-067\nResearchers at Stanford have developed an innovation that will enhance the depth of the imaging capabilities for optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging.\nOptical coherence tomography is a technique for visualizing various medias that was originally developed in the 1990s for the imaging of ocular measurements. This technique is of clinical significance due to its ability to image tissue morphology at a much higher resolution than other clinical imaging techniques such as MRI. OCT provides what are effectively 'optical ultrasound' images by directing an optical beam at a tissue of interest. A fraction of this light will then be reflected from sub-surface features of the tissue and subsequently recorded to create a digital reconstruction of the sub-surface tissue morphology. The key advantage of this technique is its high resolution and lack of ionizing radiation due to its use of light as a reflective source rather than sound or radio frequency. Despite advancements in the field of OCT imaging, improved methods to extend the depth of focus in these systems represents a major unmet medical need.\nStage of Development\nResearch-\nin vivo\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed new methods of creating needle-shaped beams to extend the depth of focus in OCT imaging systems. Briefly, a diffractive optical element with a predetermined phase profile is used to create a single beam with multiple foci along the axial direction of propagation. This then produces a beam that has both a large depth of focus and a narrow diameter. This needle shaped beam can then be used in a myriad of optical imaging and analysis systems. While other OCT systems utilize multiple beams, they fail to achieve the same extended depth that the inventor's system does without considerable draw backs. The inventor's system provides the capability to extend the depth of focus of imaging in an OCT system while maintaining lateral resolution along the depth of the image, allowing for an increased depth of focus without sacrificing a wide field of view.\n\nApplications: Increased depth of focus imaging for clinical applications such as ocular imaging, Increased depth of focus imaging for preclinical applications such as improved depth of imaging in animal models that require non-invasive imaging techniques..\n\nAdvantages: Maintains OCT systems' non-invasive imaging method, Extends the depth of focus of current OCT systems without sacrificing on lateral field of view.."

CZB-207S\nStanford ref. no. S21-113\nResearchers at Stanford have developed compounds that act as potent anti-cancer drugs which selectively inhibit CDK19 over CD8 and promise a greater therapeutic index and reduced systemic toxicity.\nBreast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide. Patient mortality rates have been decreasing due to earlier detection methods and screening of genetic biomarkers associated with at-risk populations. However, targeted therapeutic strategies have not advanced to an equal extent, in particular against patients diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a particularly aggressive and invasive cancer subtype and the only therapeutic intervention available to these patients is chemotherapy, which is known to be non-specific, highly toxic, and therefore limited. In addition, patients diagnosed with TNBC often experience worse survival outcomes than patients with other types of breast cancer.\nCyclin-dependent kinase 19 (CDK19) and a related isoform CDK8 are oncogenic transcription-related kinases that play a role in certain cancers, including TNBC. Compounds that non-selectively inhibit CDK19 and CDK8 have been explored for their anti-cancer properties but have shown to have undesirable side effects due to the CDK8 inhibition, which is more widely-distributed in tissues than CDK19. Therefore, there remains a need for compounds which selectively inhibit CDK19 over CDK8, as well as new methods of treating cancers such as TNBC that comprise administering such compounds.\nStage of Development\nResearch –\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed compounds that are inhibitors of CDK19. Inhibition of CDK19 has been shown to be effective against breast cancer, including TNBC. The disclosed compounds bind to and inhibit the activity of CDK19, and selectively inhibit CDK19 over CDK8, thereby minimizing or avoiding side effects caused by targeting CDK8, for example gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nApplications: The compounds described herein can be used to inhibit CDK19 activity, and thus can be used to treat conditions mediated by CDK19, such as cancers with aberrant CDK19 activity., Suitable cancers which can be treated include but are not limited to breast cancer, prostate cancer, cancer of the gastrointestinal tract, bladder cancer, sarcoma, cervical cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma, glioma and ovarian cancer., Combination therapy with a compound described herein with another suitable therapeutic agent including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, surgery and a combination thereof..\n\nAdvantages: The compounds described herein selectively inhibit CDK19 over CDK8. CDK8 is more widespread in the body's tissue and thereby targeting CDK8 causes more unintended side effects.."

Liquid biopsies that measure cfRNA afford broad clinical utility as these transcripts can reflect the health status of multiple tissue types. Most current assays focus on tissue-level contributions when trying to identify the cell types of origin of these cfRNA transcripts, however cell-level identity would be even more powerful for identifying the cellular pathophysiology contributing to the formation of the disease. In addition, this level of analysis would more closely match the resolution provided by invasive biopsy procedures.\nStage of Development\nResearch –\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a method to identify cell types of origin for cfRNA from liquid biopsies. This method uses the Tabula Sapiens transcriptomic cell atlas as well as individual tissue transcriptomic cell atlases in combination with the Human Protein Atlas RNA consensus data set. The method identifies cell type signature scores, which allow for the inference of cell types that contribute to cfRNA for a variety of diseases.\n\nApplications: Integration of tissue-of-origin and single cell transcriptomics to identify cell-types-of-origin of cfRNA., Non-invasive resolution of cellular pathophysiology with cfRNA..\n\nAdvantages: More closely matching the resolution of tissue biopsies than tissue-level cfRNA identification., A non-invasive procedure to study cellular pathophysiology and its contribution to disease., Applications to a variety of physiological conditions spanning cancer, obstetrics, neurodegeneration and liver disease.."

CZB-221S\nStanford ref. no. S21-272\nResearchers at Stanford have developed a new therapeutic avenue for the treatment of RNA viral infections.\nMyriad advances in the field of infectious diseases have been made in the last century, including the development of antibiotics and the widespread use of vaccines. While vaccines offer a powerful tool for prophylaxis against viral (and some bacterial) infections, there is a dearth of treatments available to those who are already infected with a specific virus. Anti-retroviral therapy is a notable exception to this rule, with anti-polymerase and anti-proteinase pharmaceuticals comprising an incredibly effective strategy in controlling viral replication of HIV. However, these treatments remain costly and unavailable to most people worldwide despite nearly 40 years on the market. Additional therapeutic strategies are needed to adequately address RNA viral infections worldwide.\nStage of Development\nResearch-\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors discovered that circular RNAs (cRNAs) that are encoded in RNA viral genomes can have pro-viral effects. In this vein, they have developed methods to inhibit cRNAs that have been identified as pro-viral and can therefore hamper viral replication in human cells. These methods include siRNA or shRNAs that target the cRNAs, an RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas system, or a small molecule. These methods can be used in both infected and bystander cells. Furthermore, the inventors also discovered specific cRNAs that act on host proteins to dampen the innate immune response in cells, therefore allowing excess viral replication. In turn, the inventors provide additional methods of viral replication impediment in the form of inhibiting these cRNAs that inhibit the innate immune response in cells, and therefore allows the host's own immune system to respond more effectively to a viral infection.\n\nApplications: Treatment of RNA virus infections by limiting replication of the virus and/or promoting greater effectiveness of the hosts immune system to eliminate the virus..\n\nAdvantages: This method encompasses both nuclear RNA viruses, such as flaviviruses and coronaviruses, as well as nuclear RNA viruses, such as influenza or retroviruses., Provides additional therapeutic targets in the treatment of RNA viral infections which comprises an urgent unmet medical need."
Stanford University,LIGHT CONTROLLED PROXIMITY LABELING WITH LOV-TURBO,Docket #: S22-487,Published Application: WO2024186837,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/light-controlled-proximity-labeling-lov-turbo,"Technology Reference\nCZ Biohub ref. no. CZB-273S-P1\nStanford ref. no. S22-487\nResearchers at Stanford University have developed a new approach for proximity labeling via optogenetic control.\nAllosteric regulation is common in naturally occurring enzymes in living tissues. However, despite its ability to improve spatial and temporal control, allostery has yet to be used extensively in artificially engineered enzymes.\nOne artificially engineered enzyme, TurboID, achieves broad proximity-dependent biotinylation. While Turbo is useful for mapping interactomes and organelle proteomes both in vivo and in vitro, one important drawback is that Turbo's substrate, biotin, is endogenously expressed in most tissues of living organisms. This endogenous expression severely limits its temporal specificity. Furthermore, poor genetic integration and targeting can additionally contribute to the limited spatial specificity of Turbo and other proximity labeling enzymes. This limitation can be highly dependent on cell type, cellular compartment, and proteins of interest. Further methods are needed to improve the spatial specificity of proximity labeling via Turbo.\nStage of Development\nResearch -\nin vivo\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a light-regulated version of Turbo, dubbed LOV-Turbo. This enzyme was engineered through a combination of structure-guided design, screening and directed evolution to express a light-dependent domain. LOV-Turbo has virtually undetectable activity in darkness but activates within seconds of weak blue light illumination. Additionally, LOV-Turbo has an extremely wide dynamic range even in the presence of high amounts of biotin. The inventors have proven in a peer-reviewed study that this enzyme can efficiently and accurately perform proximity labeling in yeast, bacteria, and the mouse brain. This is especially impressive considering that neurons have a relatively high burden of biotin and are therefore more prone to confounding background noise in the original TurboID system. The applications of LOV-Turbo are vast, exciting, and represent a step forward in the field of enzyme engineering.\n\nApplications: Enhanced spatial and temporal specificity when compared to other proximity-labeling enzymes., Ability to perform pulse-chase experiments to explore protein shuttling between different cellular compartments., LOV-Turbo can be activated by the luciferase NanoLuc via BRET to selectively biotinylate protein subcomplexes..\n\nAdvantages: Comparable activity to the original TurboID enzyme, Increases temporal and spatial specificity when compared to other proximity labeling enzymes., Provides additional avenues for the interrogation of cellular and molecular biology.."

Treatments like methadone offer a path to recovery for heroin addiction, but are burdened with high relapse rates, strict governmental oversight, and continued abuse potential, highlighting the need for non-opioid alternatives.\nCannabis derivatives offer a possible treatment for opioid dependence. Rodent studies from Stanford's Shamloo and Barron laboratories suggest that the CB2 cannabinoid receptor is a meditator of the anti-addictive properties of cannabis derivatives. Selective targeting of the CB2 receptor- while avoiding the psychoactive effects of the CB1 receptor- can therefore be a viable strategy for the treatment of opioid use disorder.\nThe inventors have designed a library of agonists for the CB2 receptor that maximize selectivity without activating CB1. As a result, the compounds minimize the psychoactive effects of cannabinoid use, while maximizing the mitigation of addiction behaviors.\nBeyond opioid use dependence, the compound library also has applications in pain relief and management, inflammatory disorders, and neuroinflammation.\n\nApplications: Treatment for, opioid use dependence, pain management, inflammatory diseases, stroke, neuroinflammation, Animal models of opioid addiction.\n\nAdvantages: Non-opioid option for addiction treatment, Avoids psychoactive effects of cannabis derivatives, Non-addictive option for pain relief."

Stanford University,Methods and proteins for targeting human progenitor exhausted T cells,Docket #: S23-114,Published Application: WO2024206930,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/methods-and-proteins-targeting-human-progenitor-exhausted-t-cells,"Immune checkpoint blockade, a class of immunotherapy treatment which works by blocking inhibitory receptors on T cells to improve immune responses, has proven to be a remarkable clinical advance in the treatment of many diseases, particularly in cancer. However, most patients do not benefit from checkpoint blockade, and many of those who do eventually experience progression of disease. While the use of immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized cancer treatment, there is a need for greater mechanistic understanding of how checkpoint blockade works in patients.\nRecent studies have suggested that the success of immune checkpoint blockade may be related to the expansion of a population of T cells known as progenitor exhausted T cells. This population of progenitor exhausted T cells is known to express the inhibitory receptor PD-1 and the transcription factor TCF1. However, TCF1 is not expressed on the cell surface, making it difficult to target. Furthermore, there is no validated way to target these progenitor exhausted T cells in humans, as most studies have been performed in mice. Thus, there is an unmet need for more markers that can specifically identify progenitor exhausted T cells in humans. Doing so could enable the selective targeting and activation of the exhausted T cell population, potentially leading to improved patient responses to immune checkpoint blockade.\nInventors at Stanford have profiled the T cell compartment of patients with lung cancer using single-cell-paired RNA and T cell receptor sequencing methods at high depth and regional resolution. They have identified a population of progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells in the lymph node of patients that are clonally linked to terminally exhausted T cells in the tumor. Additionally, by performing antigen specificity assays, the inventors found that this progenitor exhausted T cell population comprises a subset of tumor antigen-specific T cells, suggesting they are involved in the tumor response. Computational analysis identified several genes that preferentially mark these lymph node progenitor exhausted T cells, including CCL5, CMC1, EOMES, IL32, SIRPG, RARRES3, CST7, GZMM, and PDIA3. This invention can enable methods that can specifically target progenitor exhausted T cells in humans to modulate this population for clinical benefit.\n\nApplications: Immunology research, Selective targeting and activation of progenitor T cell population during immune checkpoint blockade treatment, Immunotherapy.\n\nAdvantages: There is currently no clinical standard for targeting these progenitor exhausted T cells in humans.."

The other fusion protein contains a catalytic domain that is placed in close proximity to the mRNA, enabling editing of the mRNA and allowing translation of an output (protein) coding sequence on the mRNA.\nThere are three classes of LIDAR sensors with the same core mechanism of activation: cLIDAR with a cytosolic ligand, eLIDAR with an extracellular ligand but intracellular components, and tLIDAR with an extracellular ligand whose detection is mediated by a natural receptor, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). LIDAR can detect most extracellular ligands that have a natural receptor including small molecules, peptides, and proteins. The input could also be synthetic, allowing for detection of most proteins that can be bound by antibodies, natural binding domains, or small molecules that can trigger dimerization of a protein pair. LIDAR is also capable of sensing intangible external stimuli, such as light or magnet fields. Multiple inputs could also be detected at the same time with multiple distinct outputs or conditional outputs. LIDAR can further directly interface with RADAR technology to detect both an mRNA of interest and a protein of interest. The output could be any protein that is able to be encoded on a single mRNA transcript.\nStage of Development:\nProof of Concept\n\nApplications: Can be integrated into natural signaling cascades or synthetic circuits for precise tuning of complex cellular functions, Can enable detection of both cell type (as defined by mRNAs in the cell) and the surrounding state (as defined by proteins, peptides, or small molecules inside or outside the cell), Could be applied as the basis of next-generation cell therapies such as CAR-T, Could be applied in cell engineering applications, allowing for markerless selection of cells for purification or to screen for increased protein production.\n\nAdvantages: Leverages RNA editing to exert function, a feature that no existing synthetic receptors possess, Can incorporate signals from an expanded set of inputs not accessible with current technologies, Can be delivered wholly by RNA, which broadens potential delivery strategies and enables in vivo delivery, Response time would be much faster than synthetic receptors that rely on transcription factors, Can be built upon completely humanized components, which is much safer and more compatible with in vivo applications, Can be built upon a variety of receptor architectures (cLIDAR, eLIDAR and tLIDAR)."

Stanford University,Pericytes are intermediate progenitors for epicardial-derived coronary artery smooth muscle,Docket #: S14-051,"Published Application: 20170312319, Issued: 10,543,235 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/pericytes-are-intermediate-progenitors-epicardial-derived-coronary-artery-smooth-muscle,"Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, yet coronary artery development and regeneration remain poorly understood. Although it is known that epicardial cells on the surface of the heart give rise to coronary artery smooth muscle deep in the myocardium, the differentiation steps between the epicardium and mature smooth muscle were previously unknown. Inventors at Stanford discovered that pericytes, mural cells closely associated with small blood vessels, are epicardial-derived progenitors for coronary artery smooth muscle. Pericytes is a new potential cell type for cell therapy that could be used for vascular regeneration, revascularization after an infarct, or vascular malformation.\nThe Red-Horse Lab have developed a method of providing smooth muscle cells to a tissue where they are needed. The invention involves creating an isolated population of epicardial-derived pericytes and providing the pericytes to the tissue of interest. The epicardial-derived pericytes then differentiate into smooth muscle cells that express smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. The pericytes are lineage committed but not as matured as smooth muscle cells, making them the ideal cell type to inject and induce angiogenesis within new tissues. This invented method also paves the way for pericytes to act as a drug target for vascular abnormalities in particular diseases which involve deregulated smooth muscle or deregulated pericytes.\n\nApplications: -Drug target for vascular diseases involving abnormal pericyte/smooth muscle deregulation., -Cell therapy applications where injected pericytes could induce angiogenesis in devascularized regions of all tissues in the body or replace lost smooth muscle on diseased vessels., -Smooth muscle angiogenesis.\n\nAdvantages: -lineage traced the intermediate step of pericytes differentiating into smooth muscle cells and obtained evidence for this differentiation pathway using 2 transgenic mouse models, -Pericytes are lineage committed but not as matured as smooth muscle cells, making them the ideal cell type to inject and induce angiogenesis within new tissues."

This innovative technique utilizes synergistic control of optical systems and fluid mechanics to achieve micrometer XY and Z resolution, surpassing the limitations of traditional stereolithographic printing. By effectively displacing trapped resin in microchannels, which are prone to UV accumulation and print-through, using an oxygenated or non-reactive agents, the iCLIP process breaks the requirement of low UV penetration depth to resolve high-resolution micro-structures. Thus, iCLIP can significantly expand the material options available for 3D-printing microsystems.

Stanford University,3D-printed Microarray Patch (MAP) Designs for Intradermal Delivery and Sampling,Docket #: S23-158,Published Application: WO2024227075,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/3d-printed-microarray-patch-map-designs-intradermal-delivery-and-sampling,"Stanford researchers have developed novel designs for 3D-printed microarray patches (MAPs) that can improve intradermal drug delivery and sampling. These designs support the use of microneedles for minimally invasive therapy administration and diagnostics.\nDelivering medicine transdermally is highly desirable because in the dermis there is a lack of sensory nerves as well as a higher migratory immune cell population than in the subcutaneous layer. Delivering therapeutics to the dermis is difficult, however, because microneedles need to be able to penetrate the outermost layer of skin and remain retained in the skin while delivering a payload or drawing up fluid. MAPs need to overcome viscoelastic forces in skin and pressure due to interstitial fluid and surrounding tissue.\nThis invention uses 3D printing techniques to create MAPs with complex geometries to address these challenges. These new designs enable MAPs to be widely adopted in clinical settings to deliver therapeutics and collect samples for diagnosis. MAP drug delivery platforms are minimally invasive, self-administrable, and have the potential to provide therapeutic medication to patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. This invention can increase the efficacy of medicine payloads, improve the safety of administration, and increase access to medical treatment to address global healthcare disparities.\nStage of Development\nFigure:\nFigure description: Routes of drug delivery.

Stanford University,Biochemical activation of dysfunctional skeletal stem cells for skeletal regeneration,Docket #: S20-269,Published Application: 20240181135,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/biochemical-activation-dysfunctional-skeletal-stem-cells-skeletal-regeneration,"Stanford researchers have found that aging and disease lead to skeletal stem cell (SSC) dysfunction and hence decreased bone health. The aged SSCs have lower bone-forming potential and simultaneously give rise to high numbers of pro-inflammatory stroma which enhances bone resorption through actions on hematopoietic osteoclasts. Under these conditions, individuals are prone to diseases such as osteoporosis, sustain fractures and regenerate poorly. To remedy these aged SSCs, Stanford researchers also propose a combination therapy of a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP2), and an inhibitor of colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1), to re-activate aged SSC's differentiation potential and simultaneously reduce crosstalk to hematopoietic cells favoring an inflammatory milieu. The combination therapy can be delivered through biodegradable hydrogels placed topical to the fracture site. This treatment expands aged SSC pools, reduces osteoclast activity, and enhances bone healing.\nStage of Development\nIn vivo mouse model: experimentally shown in mice, placing biodegradable hydrogels containing recombinant BMP2 and blocking antibody to CSF1 around fractured areas of bones can restore regeneration capacity of otherwise impaired phenotype.\n\nApplications: Bone healing after facial reconstruction, Skeletal regeneration like fracture healing.\n\nAdvantages: Less problematic than transplantation of autologous/allogenic cells, Suitable for high risk patients (aged, osteoporotic), Easy procedure: during open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), routinely performed by orthopedic surgeons to align bone fragments, hydrogels containing the combination therapy can be placed at the fracture site."

It does so by inhibiting growth of Borrelia burgdorferi, the main causative agent of Lyme disease.\nApproximately 1 in 7 people worldwide currently have or have had Lyme disease, with prevalence highest in Central Europe, East Asia, and Western Europe. The standard of care is antibiotic treatment, from which most patients make a full recovery. However, between 5 – 20% of patients report persistent physical and/or neurological symptoms after antibiotic treatment. These mechanisms for disease persistence, as well as biological risk factors, remain poorly understood. The inventors discovered that a mutation to the gene encoding a human secretoglobin protein reduced the inhibition of Borrelia burgdorferi growth, and increased the susceptibility to Lyme Disease. This invention, therefore, identifies a novel target for therapeutic intervention, both prophylactically and to potentially treat late-stage Lyme disease.\nStage of Development\nPreclinical\n\nApplications: Treatment of Lyme Disease (e.g. recombinant protein therapy, gene editing, small molecule agonists, etc.), Possible treatment of late-stage Lyme Disease, Prophylactic in high-risk areas/populations (especially those carrying the missense variant to the human secretoglobin gene).\n\nAdvantages: Possible topical treatment, Alternative to antibiotic treatment, Prophylactic avenue of treatment."
Stanford University,Leptin analogs to treat obesity,Docket #: S22-307,Published Application: WO2024050285,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/leptin-analogs-treat-obesity,"Stanford scientists in Chris Garcia's lab have developed leptin analogs that have potentially more favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacological signaling properties for use as diabetes and obesity drugs.\nExcess body weight is a primary underlying risk factor for a variety of human diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and several types of cancer. Although a variety of dietary and pharmacological interventions have emerged in the past several decades to combat obesity, therapeutics capable of safely promoting significant and sustained weight loss are still needed.\nLeptin is a hormone that plays a critical role in regulating energy balance and body weight. When functioning properly, leptin suppresses hunger and increases energy expenditure, helping to maintain a stable body weight. Previous attempts to use leptin as a drug have been disappointing in part due to Leptin resistance and high serum leptin levels in obese patients also present an obstacles to the efficacy of wild-type-leptin-based drugs.\nThis invention describes engineered leptin variants that function as high affinity biased agonists, thereby decoupling activation of the anorexigenic LepR-STAT3 pathway from pathways associated with leptin resistance. Together with additional modifications that enhance the solubility and stability of these variants, these leptin analogs could overcome the challenges of the native Leptin protein and lead to novel pharmacological outcomes that help overcome leptin resistance.\nStage of Development\nResearch - in vitro\n\nApplications: Therapeutics for obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia.\n\nAdvantages: Novel leptin variants with anti-obesity and anti-diabetic properties, Improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacological signaling properties, Large potential market due to growing obesity and diabetes epidemic."

Lower muscle mass across large human cohorts has been strongly associated with higher incidence of obesity, worsened diabetes and metabolic disease, frailty in the elderly, and even increased mortality. A class of peptide ligands that regulate muscle mass are growth hormone (GH) secretagogues. These peptide agonists act in the pituitary to increase GH secretion, leading to downstream activation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) and IGF1-mediated anabolic pathways. GH secretagogues have attracted considerable therapeutic potential as anti-frailty and anti-cachexic agents, while also being explored for growth retardation, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and cardiometabolic disease.\nInventors at Stanford have devised a genomic prediction algorithm to identify candidate pyroglutamyl amidated peptides that might be hidden within existing genomic sequences. By applying this algorithm to the mouse and human genomes, they have identified candidate peptides sequences with both N- and C-terminal posttranslational modifications that are 100% conserved between the two species. A subset of the synthetic peptides corresponding to these predicted sequences exhibit robust GH secretagogue activity in vitro. The inventors showed robust detection of these peptides in mouse plasma, establishing their endogenous presence. Furthermore, they have obtained evidence for a receptor-based mechanism of action that is independent of the classical GHS receptor and GHRH receptor pathways. The identified peptides might be useful for the treatment of disorders, including cachexia, growth retardation, frailty, and gastrointestinal dysfunction, via the anabolic activation of the GH/IGF1.\n\nApplications: -A drug for patients for increasing muscle mass and preventing frailty, cachexia, or growth retardation., -Cellular and molecular research techniques, -Cell signaling, -Algorithm to identify peptides for metabolic pathways.\n\nAdvantages: -Computational platform enables identification of peptides that activate the GH/IGF1 axis independent of any of the known upstream pathways, -Predicted sequences are validated in vitro, -can be used to detect peptides from unknown pathways."

Stanford University,Nanoparticle agent to eradicate drug resistant bacteria in the growth arrest phase,Docket #: S22-258,Published Application: WO2024044636,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/nanoparticle-agent-eradicate-drug-resistant-bacteria-growth-arrest-phase,"Stanford researchers have developed a method to eliminate antibiotic resistant gram-negative bacteria in the growth arrest phase.  The increase in relapsing bacterial infections and the rise of drug resistant bacteria are significant global health problems.  Stanford researchers in the Santa Maria Lab have developed a gold nanocluster (AuNC) functionalized with adenosine triphosphate (AuNC@ATP) that kills drug-resistant (XDR) strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa in vitro.  This nanoparticle eradicates bacteria in the growth arrest phase by disrupting cytoplasmic Mg2+ homeostasis through augmentation of Mg2+-chelating ATP at a non-physiological cytoplasmic concentration. The AuNC is also expected to inhibit FtsH proteolysis activity.  Initial gastrointestinal safety studies of AuNCs coated with either hydroxyl (AuNC@PEG-OH)- or amine (AuNC@PEG-NH2)-functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) indicate the gold nanocluster is non-toxic.   Stanford research of this promising antimicrobial nanoparticle is ongoing.\nImage courtesy the Santa Maria Lab\nStage of Development – Pre-Clinical \nResearchers continue to develop strategies to prevent relapse in chronic bacterial infections and evaluate the potential for antibiotic resistance development.

Additionally, Tregs can help reduce graft vs host disease (GVHD) and allograft rejection.\nFor example, a population of cells comprising cryopreserved Tregs can be administered to an HCT recipient subject, and the population of Tregs can serve to reduce or prevent GVHD in the HCT recipient subject.\nStage of Development\nClinical testing\n\nApplications: T regulatory cell therapy.\n\nAdvantages: Allows T regulatory cells to retain therapeutic effect due to higher cell viability, Helps to maintain T regulatory cell viability, phenotype and function, Improvements as compared to current cryopreservation methods:, Treg surface receptor expression is preserved, Treg suppression function as measured by their capacity to reduce proliferating CD3 T cells in vitro (suppression assay) is preserved, Minimal manipulation for cryopreservation of Treg specifically based on length of stimulation and other factors."
Stanford University,Lens Capsule Drug Delivery Device,Docket #: S22-355,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/lens-capsule-drug-delivery-device,"A Stanford researcher has designed an artificial lens capsule as a drug delivery device inserted at the time of cataract surgery, to address issues of extended drug delivery to the eye with minimal complications.\nExtended drug delivery to the eye addresses clinical burden as well as non-compliance with eye drop regimens, low ocular absorption with drops, and the risks and burdens of intravitreal injections on patients. There are currently extended release steroid implants for the posterior segment of the eye. Recently, there was a novel drug delivery device for extended anti-VEGF medication, which involved a refillable intraocular reservoir with a diffusion filter to allow for extended release. However, due to the nature of the surgery during implantation, there are side effects including a 2% endophthalmitis rate, 5.2% vitreous hemorrhage, 3.6% conjunctival erosion, and 5.9% conjunctival bleb. This limits clinical adoptability. The lens capsule is a safe space in the eye and has an extensive safety profile for implanted intraocular lenses. Stanford researchers propose using a drug delivery scaffold for implantation in the lens capsule at the time of cataract surgery, which is known as a safe surgery with very low surgical complications. This drug delivery scaffold is used to hold the new intraocular lens at the time of cataract surgery. In addition, it contains a valved drug delivery reservoir with a diffusion filter to allow extended drug delivery. The lens capsule is between the anterior and posterior segments of the eye and will allow for extended drug delivery to the anterior chamber for anterior medications such as glaucoma medication, antibiotics, and steroids. It will also allow extended drug delivery to the posterior chamber with medications targeting the retina, such as anti-VEGF medications, complement inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and chemotherapy medications. The researchers believe that this drug delivery scaffold can use known technology such as extended drug delivery through a refillable reservoir to provide extended drug delivery to either the anterior or posterior chamber of the eye with low surgical complications. The drug delivery scaffold holds the intraocular lens that is implanted during cataract surgery and allows for safe intraocular lens exchange. This may benefit patients desiring an upgrade of their premium intraocular lens, or for patients with shifting refractions, such as the pediatric population.\nStage of Development \nPrototype and designs conceived\n\nApplications: anti-VEGF and/or anti-angiopoietin 2 pharmaceuticals, Glaucoma medications, extended delivery of intraocular antibiotics at the time of surgery to lower endophthalmitis risk, Complement inhibitors, anti-inflammatory medications, ocular inflammation / uveitis.\n\nAdvantages: Re-fillable drug delivery reservoir, Delivery to anterior and / or posterior chamber, Universal design allows customization for specific molecules, Allows intraocular lens exchange for new lenses, Implantation at same time as cataract surgery, Reduced surgery complications."
Stanford University,Wavefront manipulation by electrically and fluidically tuned polymer metasurfaces,Docket #: S22-224,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/wavefront-manipulation-electrically-and-fluidically-tuned-polymer-metasurfaces,"Active manipulation of light beams is required for a range of emerging optical technologies, including sensing, optical computing, virtual/augmented reality, dynamic holography, and computational imaging. Miniaturization of these optical components is key to facilitating their integration into a range of applications. Despite many advances, the size and weight of traditional macroscopic lenses and dynamic optical elements still take up significant space due to their use of classic optical elements. Therefore, it is highly desirable to reduce the size and weight of the dynamic optical components in such systems. Subwavelength control over the phase using ordered arrays of nanoantennae, or metasurfaces, could allow this goal to be achieved. Tunable metasurface lenses have been realized and typically use strain or thermal tuning of the entire metasurface or mechanical movement between metasurface lenses. Recent efforts have demonstrated impressive modulation of phase and color of pixel elements that could be individually actuated with high-speed microelectromechanical MEMs technology. However, these are challenging to fabricate and experience limitations in dynamic applications due to vibration instability.\nInventors at Stanford have created a hybrid polymer/metal tunable optical metasurface system, with operation in wavelength ranges from the visible to the infrared. It can reversibly tune the color and phase of reflected wavefronts through applications of stimuli, including applied voltage or application of suitable fluids to the surface of the metasurface. The tuning mechanism is non-volatile, involving changes in polymer thickness due to changes in thermodynamic equilibrium condition. . In the case of fluidic control, the fluid infiltrates into the polymer and causes a change in the swelling degree. In the case of electrochemical control, applied voltage leads to ion intercalation, modifying the swelling degree. Depending on the specific design chosen, this can result in a change of the reflected color from the metasurface, continuous tuning of the direction of the reflected beam, or on-off modulation between different diffraction orders. These ultra-thin devices can also be made with thicknesses of 500nm, much smaller than conventional optical elements that range from the millimeter to centimeter scale. Nanoscale optical elements, combined with rapid advances in electrical control systems, or microfluidic systems infrastructure, could enable the next generation of optical elements light control.\n\nApplications: low power optical modulators, reconfigurable optical devices (including reconfigurable lensing and display), and sensing systems directly integrated into nano/microfluidic systems., Microfluidic systems and existing technologies, any dynamically tunable focusing devices, virtual/augmented reality devices, wearable optical systems, use in color display elements (such as Kindles).\n\nAdvantages: can be integrated with electrical control methods (including low voltage CMOS chips), and patterned to allow for discrete pixelated control, can be integrated with existing microfluidics technology, system can be made ultracompact and avoids the use of complex mechanics, could be apply to flat, wavelength specific, dynamically tunable focusing devices, which require no power upon moving to a new focus state, Response times of 100ms could be of benefit to high throughput systems, Use of liquid and electrochemical tuning allows for reliable and durable operation without typical mechanical wear, Can be directly integrated into microfluidic system for inline sensing of system parameters, including potentially concentrations of biomolecules (e.g. with modifications of the polymer)."
Stanford University,Iridium Oxide Schottky Contacts for High Temperature Aluminum Nitride-Based Devices,Docket #: S22-260,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/iridium-oxide-schottky-contacts-high-temperature-aluminum-nitride-based-devices,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed Schottky contacts for aluminum nitride-based microelectronic devices. The contacts enable reliable device operation at up to 600 ºC, opening up opportunities for high temperature microelectronic performance.\nMicroelectronics capable of operating reliably at high temperature are necessary to provide sensing, readout, and telecommunications for applications in the space, aerospace, defense, automotive, and oil and gas sectors. Typical microelectronics produced for commercial, industrial, and military grade electronics, can often only perform reliably at temperatures up to 125 ºC. Above these temperatures, semiconductors fail to meet critical parameters and degradation can cause permanent failure. Aluminum nitride (AlN)-based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) that leverage the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) have shown promise for high temperature operations. However, the reliability is often limited by the degradation of accompanying metallization and passivation layers.\nThis technology provides a Schottky gate material as a passivation layer on AlN that can enable reliable high-temperature operation of AlN-based HEMTs. By oxidizing iridium on the AlN surface, devices fabricated with the material have demonstrated increased stability at high temperatures. Specifically, well-known degradation mechanisms in AlN-based devices, such as metal diffusion or electromigration during electrical characterization, are absent even at temperatures up to 600 ºC. Thus, the material offers promise in application to a variety of AlN-based devices where high temperature performance is essential.\nStage of Development: Proof of Concept\n\nApplications: Supercritical CO2 well leak detection in carbon capture and storage processes, Industrial under-the-hood automotive and aircraft engine applications, Uncooled downhole sensor readout for processes in the oil and gas industry, Gas turbines, Hypersonic structures, Aerospace missions such as to the surface of Venus (surface temperature 465 ºC).\n\nAdvantages: Free from deleterious strain relaxation effects at high temperature that have been demonstrated to lower the 2DEG density and adversely affect device performance in AlGaN based devices, Offers higher electron mobilities so they are better for high frequency, high temperature applications compared to silicon carbide-based devices."

One of the current challenges in neuroscience is to understand molecular identity, activity level and circuit wiring of individual cells within intact brain networks. Methods to investigate neuronal networks in intact tissues have been developed but are not optimal. For instance, these methods have used antibody staining for molecular analysis. This is costly and has a low success rate. In addition, these approaches may not be compatible with RNA detection and thus a wealth of biological information is left behind. There is a need to develop additional methods to visualize neuronal networks including the RNA in intact tissues. To help meet this need the inventors developed this technology which provides methods for fixation and detection of RNA in transparent intact tissues.

Stanford University,Disease Management System,Docket #: S20-477,Published Application: WO2022261007,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/disease-management-system,"Technology Reference Nos.\nCZ Biohub ref. no. CZB-192S-PC\nStanford ref.no. S20-477\nResearchers at CZ Biohub SF and Stanford University have developed a new disease management system that enables efficient population-level tracking of disease incidence rates.\nIn recent years, the risk of pandemics has become much more visible to the public. As a result of ongoing international development and our ever-growing proximity to populations of wild animals, viral zoonotic jumps from animals to humans are becoming more and more common. As we continue to encroach on the natural habitats of many species, including those known to be reservoir species for zoonotic viruses including bats and pigs, pandemics caused by novel viral species are almost certainly inevitable. This widespread occurrence has huge global health implications, and therefore it is an urgent unmet medical need to develop plug-and-play pandemic readiness systems. It is impossible to predict what virus or family of viruses will jump from animals to humans next, but the need to be prepared for these events is more prescient than ever. Diagnostic testing is a key component of managing these outbreaks. However, testing every person in a population daily is unwieldly, expensive, and ultimately not feasible.\nStage of Development\nResearch - in vivo\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a low-cost and efficient disease management system to allow entities to track disease incidences in a set population. This technique enables virtually any organization, from schools to employers to public health departments to track disease incidence and allows them to respond in real time to outbreaks. This program uses remote self-collection via nasopharyngeal swabs for convenience and efficient use. Participants are first screened for eligibility and asked to take a survey about their background and initial health. Selected participants then have a home self-testing kit delivered to them with samples picked up for laboratory analysis. Participants also undergo ongoing symptom surveillance via daily surveys that alert and trigger repeat testing. Through this targeted and convenient testing strategy, this platform provides algorithms to test both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals to allow for accurate population-level estimates of real time disease incidences. Participants receive the results of this testing directly on a private, secure website.\n\nApplications: Testing and evaluation of disease incidence rates in specific populations in real time, Screening individuals for symptoms on a daily basis to limit the spread of disease.\n\nAdvantages: Testing strategies for both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, Ongoing symptom surveillance throughout your population in order to ensure that those experiencing symptoms undergo testing as soon as possible, limiting the spread of disease, Scalable on a population level."

Current movement sensing technologies are bulky, complex, and require multiple sensors on a substrate.  The Bao Group nanomesh is made from biocompatible materials that can be directly printed on a person's skin.  It mimics human cutaneous receptors by translating electrical resistance changes from fine skin stretches into proprioception.  A single nanomesh simultaneously measures finger movements from multiple joints.  A time-dependent contrastive learning algorithm differentiates between different unlabeled motions.

With this wave of large omic (genomic, proteomic, among others) datasets, novel analysis techniques, including dimensionality reduction, discriminant analysis, Bayesian classification, decision trees, and neural networks, have been developed to extract and understand important information contained in HD data. However, HD data contain multi-level information with complex relationships, and its maximal exploitation is challenging. Current methods attempt to make sense of HD data by embedding them directly onto a low dimension without explicitly considering the underlying biological characteristics of the dataset.\nStanford scientists, therefore, developed a method called genomap that transforms HD data into an ordered format that allows maximization of information of specific omics data interactions, like gene-gene interactions and enables deep exploration of the resulting information by advanced signal processing techniques such as multidimensional convolution filtering. They tested this approach on various gene expression datasets and showed that it vastly improves the performance of analyses compared to existing methods.\nStage of Development\nPrototype\n\nApplications: Tabular HD data analysis for various applications including industrial product development and scientific research in drug discovery, genomic analysis, data classification and clustering, sensor data analysis, disease detection, marketing and finance data analysis, social media, telecommunication, etc..\n\nAdvantages: First of its kind, Transforms tabular data into a configured data format., Uses image processing techniques on tabular data for extracting high level information., Applicable to a wide variety of HD data.."

This invention presents a promising solution: potent monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against sarbecoviruses elicited by an AS03-adjuvanted monovalent subunit vaccine. These antibodies have demonstrated a high degree of effectiveness against several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the Omicron sublineages, and other related viruses.

Stanford University,Spatiotemporal encoding for multiplexing of droplet assays,Docket #: S22-501,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/spatiotemporal-encoding-multiplexing-droplet-assays,"Stanford inventors have devised a method of multiplexing droplet reactions to analyze and identify many reactions in parallel on a single microfluidic chip using off-the-shelf flow control and valving.\nDroplet microfluidics systems rely on creating droplets within a carrier, immiscible fluid, and are widely used in analytical detection in biomedical research and the clinic. Multiplexing droplet multiplexed systems isuseful for increasing throughput and required for some custom assays, and several strategies have been implemented. These include multiple fluorescence dyes (e.g., using multiple emission wavelengths and color filters), barcoding of droplets using barcoded particles, and barcoding using gel beads containing barcoded synthetic DNA. When samples are labeled by color, a one-to-one relationship between color and a particle or reaction is common, limiting the degree of multiplexing. This is due to the finite bandwidth of the emission spectrum of commonly used fluorophores, and the limited range of the visible spectrum. There is a need for higher multiplexing capabilities for droplet microfluidics systems.\nTherefore, Stanford inventors developed a novel multiplexing method that uses fluorescence and encoding of multiple samples by the spatial and temporal sequence of droplet formations and the subsequent spatial positioning of droplets in a constrained, poorly mixed output region. This new method can be applied in varying configurations, one of which is to use four different dyes in combination with spatial positioning to achieve 48-sample multiplexing.\nStage of development\nResearch - in vitro\n\nApplications: Multiplexed droplet-based assays in biomedical research, drug discovery and cancer screening..\n\nAdvantages: Improved degree of multiplexing by one or two orders of magnitude relative to current techniques., There currently exists no assay that uses both fluorescent signal and droplet position to differentiate samples in droplet-based microfluidics assays.."

Coronary microvascular dysfunction is increasingly recognized in types of cardiovascular disease, underlining the need for more effective studies of cardiac pericytes under pathophysiological conditions. However, this goal was not readily achievable due to the scarcity of human primary cardiac pericytes. To circumvent this technical bottleneck, the inventors developed a stepwise differentiation protocol with precise activation or inhibition of key morphogens at each step, yielding pure progenitor cells and induced cardiac pericytes (named """"iPSC-CPs"""") that share comparable levels of cell markers as primary cardiac pericytes, as well as in vivo functional characteristics.

A key feature of Parkinson's disease is the accumulation of a protein called alpha-synuclein, which aggregates into Lewy bodies and results in neuronal death. Alpha-synuclein gene mutations result in early onset and progressive disease, and lowering alpha-synuclein levels alleviates disease. Parkinson's disease has no cure, and current treatments aim to manage symptoms. There is, therefore, a significant need to develop novel therapies for Parkinson's disease.\nTherefore, Stanford researchers devised a way to target alpha-synuclein and lower its levels in vivo using viral gene transfer of mutant Cas9 coupled with a small guide RNA targeting the promoter region of the alpha-synuclein gene. Viral gene transfer was achieved using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector carrying their specially designed guide RNA delivered intrathecally into the cisterna magna. With this approach, the researchers successfully downregulated alpha-synuclein in a humanized transgenic mouse model.\nStage of Development\nPreclinical\n\nApplications: Gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.\n\nAdvantages: Novel Parkinson's disease modulatory treatment."
Stanford University,Automated classification of sleep and wake from single day triaxial accelerometer data,Docket #: S22-110,Published Application: 20230320655,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/automated-classification-sleep-and-wake-single-day-triaxial-accelerometer-data,"Actigraphy, or the non-invasive study of human activity-rest cycles, is a field of study of growing importance as ambulatory and at-home monitoring of patients becomes more popular. It has the potential to revolutionize clinical trials, sleep studies, and even patient monitoring of recovery after injury or surgery. One of the most important applications of actigraphy is to understand natural sleep-wake patterns, especially since these are nearly impossible to truly replicate in a clinical or laboratory setting. With actigraphy, we can quantify the duration, timing, and quality of sleep experienced at home using automated algorithms. Actigraphy traditionally relies on data across multiple days or weeks to characterize routines and activity-rest cycles of a single person. While this may be possible for those who follow strict routines, reliance on longitudinal data collection to establish sleep patterns is not possible for those with erratic sleeping patterns or changing schedules, or in cases of shorter duration studies.\nThe Coleman Lab at Stanford has invented an algorithm capable of classifying sleep and wake states in a single day from triaxial accelerometer data. Traditional actigraphy relies on days to weeks' worth of activity data to characterize patterns of activity and rest within individuals, but reliance on longitudinal data is challenging for short studies and for individuals with irregular schedules. This novel, two-stage algorithm classifies sleep and wake states from a single day. The algorithm uses many features of triaxial accelerometer data to capture the signal variability, and a two-step process modeling reduces the noise from each single-stage classification alone. Additionally, existing algorithms classify sleep from proprietary actigraphy device outputs, but triaxial accelerometers are built into most smart devices and can be used by this algorithm, making tracking activity cycles more accessible. The invention is more accurate (97%) than the gold standard Cole-Kripke algorithm (60-70%) used in commercial clinical devices. This simple, automated algorithm capable of classifying sleep and wake robustly using triaxial accelerometer data on a single day basis would broaden the usability of actigraphy for clinical, research, and consumer device purposes.\n\nApplications: -Compatible with any wearable device that has triaxial accelerometer data capture, such as smartwatch devices from Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, and others., -Can be implemented in products to help determine sleep duration, timing, regularity, and quality for consumers who purchase these products., -Can be integrated into clinical grade wearable devices for assessing sleep, such as for at-home sleep studies or to track patients over time..\n\nAdvantages: -Widely available measure, compared to existing methods such as the Cole-Kripke algorithm that is built for proprietary measures only, -Compatible with all smart devices that have built-in triaxial accelerometers, -More accurate (97%) than the gold standard Cole-Kripke algorithm (60-70%) used in commercial clinical devices."
Stanford University,Deep Learning Segmentation of Acute Ischemic Stroke on Non-contrast CT,Docket #: S23-040,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/deep-learning-segmentation-acute-ischemic-stroke-non-contrast-ct,"Researchers at Stanford University have established a deep learning segmentation algorithm for non-contrast CT images to aid clinicians in decision making and improve the speed of symptom to treatment in acute ischemic stroke\nSupervised deep learning models are powerful tools in clinical image segmentation. While these models have promise for application to stroke imaging, there are challenges in their use in non-contrast computed tomography (CT) images. Specifically, low signal to noise ratios in non-contrast CT images restrict the development of accurate reference annotations that are essential for the supervised deep learning model training. Further, the identification of acute ischemic stroke is highly time sensitive, with clinical outcomes highly correlating with the time from symptom onset to treatment. Thus, a simple model that can directly predict a probability heat map or a binary segmentation offers a fast route for clinicians to use the information contained within non-contrast CT images in clinical decision making.\nIn this technology, a model trained on random expert sampling is established, harnessing interpretations from three expert neuroradiologists. The model can identify the location and volume of acutely ischemic brain tissue in non-contrast CT images and significantly correlates clinical outcomes. The model outperforms human expert performance, offering a faster route than current tools for clinicians to interpret non-contrast CT images for acute ischemic stroke.\nStage of Development Clinical data\n\nApplications: Automatic segmentation of acute ischemic stroke in non-contrast CT images for triaging patients for optimal treatment.\n\nAdvantages: More reliable identification, quantification, and localization of acute ischemic stroke in non-contrast CT images, Shorter times from symptom onset to treatment, which is correlated to clinical outcome, Reduces the need for additional imaging procedures, Enables the use of widely available non-contrast CT for acute ischemic stroke instead of specialized imaging procedures the require particular expertise and have more limited availability."
Stanford University,Transparent Conducting Oxide Sourced Lift-Off Scribing Method for Enhancing Electrical Contact and Material Removal in P2 and P3 Scribes of Thin Film (Perovskite) Photovoltaic Technologies,Docket #: S22-319,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/transparent-conducting-oxide-sourced-lift-scribing-method-enhancing-electrical-contact,"Stanford inventors have developed a method for manufacturing  perovskite solar modules at lower cost and greater device stability by utilizing a novel transparent conducting oxide (TCO) lift-off scribing method.\nHybrid organometallic lead-halide perovskite solar cells are an emerging thin film solar technology with the potential for lower cost production and increased performance relative to conventional silicon modules or currently available thin film technologies. However, the current methods for creating these next-generation solar modules consists of a complex multistep laser scribing  process requiring multiple laser sources across multiple layers of the starting material.\nIn this work, Stanford engineers describe a streamlined process for scribing perovskite solar cells using a TCO-based liftoff mechanism that relies solely on laser absorption in the front transparent electrode material, reducing thermal damage to the overlying layers and allowing for fast scribing speeds with low-cost ?s-pulse duration fiber laser systems. Demonstrating > 3 m/s processing speeds, TCO-based liftoff provides the highest throughput laser scribing method for thin-film photovoltaic devices produced on glass/TCO substrates, capable of processing large-area perovskite solar modules at a manufacturing scale.\nFigure Description: Figure Description: This method of scribing compared to other methods of scribing solar modules, showing an increased throughput for this technology.

Stanford University,Systems and methods for neurostimulation targeting using temporospatial connectivity Biomarker for Effective Depression Treatment,Docket #: S22-270,Published Application: WO2024015998,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/systems-and-methods-neurostimulation-targeting-using-temporospatial-connectivity,"Stanford scientists developed a novel strategy that uses resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to determine whether a person will respond to treatment for depression.\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD), a leading cause of disability worldwide, is likely a product of abnormal communication patterns within brain-wide networks. An inability to detect biomarkers of MDD in the human brain has slowed progress in MDD treatment. Mechanism-based MDD biomarkers have eluded us due to conceptual and experimental barriers. First, it is difficult to assign a causal relationship between biomarkers and MDD because causal tests are rarely performed on seemingly MDD-related differences identified in patients. Second, although MDD arises from aberrant communication in the brain, many neuroimaging studies evaluate either tonic activity levels in individual brain regions or functional connectivity between brain regions. The latter comes with a major caveat that signaling directionality is not assigned, with possibly significant physiological implications.\nStanford researchers sought to address these problems by examining how directed communication patterns in the human brain relate to the neurobiology of MDD using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and rs-fMRI. They found that active rTMS modulates the directional flow of rs-fMRI activity between different brain regions and that variance in the temporal effect's magnitude corresponds to treatment efficacy. Additionally, they found that rTMS corrects a baseline aberrancy in neural flow patterns. They also showed that the baseline temporal structure of individual patients with MDD can predict treatment response. Hence, they developed a novel biomarker for depression treatment efficacy.\nNote: This docket is related to S22-390, which describes neuromodulation targeting based on lag-based resting state functional connectivity.\nStage of Development\nResearch - in vivo\n\nApplications: Biomarker for efficacy of depression treatment.\n\nAdvantages: No other such biomarker exists on the market.."

The current standard of care for non-infectious uveitis is corticosteroids, which has frequent side effects, including steroid-induced glaucoma or cataract. To address this unmet need for alternative immunosuppressive therapies in the eye, Stanford researchers have identified a novel peptide, SEMA7A using an aptamer-based proteomics assay. This peptide comprises a binding domain for binding to its receptor Plexin C1 (PLXNC1), which in turn has a broad immunosuppressive effect in vivo, reducing the number of infiltrating neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and dendritic cells in several compartments of the eye, and affecting a wide range of inflammatory signaling pathways. The novel SEMA7A peptide has immense potential as an alternative immunosuppressive agent for ocular inflammatory diseases.\nStage of Development \nIn vivo testing and testing optimized versions of the peptide therapeutic.\n\nApplications: non-infectious uveitis.\n\nAdvantages: Broad immunosuppressive effect in vivo, improved benefit-risk ratio compared to the current standard of care (corticosteroids), No negative side-effects."

Many optic neuropathies that result in vision loss are caused by the loss of non-regenerative axons, often in the optical nerve head. Targeted delivery of therapies that promote axon regeneration may help vision prognosis in patients. However, previous techniques for optical drug delivery have not reliably accessed the optical nerve head. The proposed method specifies the microneedle gauge, angle, length, and angle of approach to access the optical nerve head from tunneling through the suprachoroidal space (SCS). The inventors demonstrate with histology and in vivo rabbit models that delivered agents localize to the optical nerve head.\nStage of Development \nDemonstrated efficacy of the invention by comparing dye distribution in histological eye samples and in vivo rabbit models against various other delivery methods.\n\nApplications: Drug delivery method targeting the optic nerve head, Ophthalmology surgical products.\n\nAdvantages: My result in minimal distruptions to the eye, Can more efficiently dose the optical nerve head."
Stanford University,Soft tissue eyelet/grommet and passing/placement device,Docket #: S22-207,Published Application: WO2023235278,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/soft-tissue-eyeletgrommet-and-passingplacement-device,"A Stanford inventor has developed a soft grommet/eyelet to load share and prevent suture pull-through of the repair stitch and a device to pass the eyelet.\nSoft tissue tears, including ligament and tendon tears, are common injuries resulting from falls, over-exertion, and athletics, which may place excessive stress on soft tissues. Some of these injuries may heal on their own. However, complete tears often require surgical intervention to reattach the soft tissue to the bone. Soft tissue can be reattached to bone using screws, staples, suture anchors, and other devices. With current methods, like suture anchors, there is a risk of additional injury during or after the procedure if tension is applied to the tissue. Any subsequent damage to soft tissue hampers healing and necessitates further surgical interventions to repair the damage. It is, therefore, necessary to develop improved methods and devices for securing soft tissues to bone post-injury to prevent tearing.\nHence, a Stanford scientist and orthopedic surgeon developed a novel grommet/eyelet and a partner device to pass the eyelet, to anchor repair stitches, and reinforce suture passage through soft tissue. The invention improves load sharing in patients undergoing tendon repairs to prevent recurrent tears.\nStage of Development\nPrototype\n\nApplications: Reinforcement of suture passage through soft tissue., Orthopedic tissue repair. Can be used for other types of tissue repair as well..\n\nAdvantages: Prevent tear through failure of the repair sutures., Safe, Efficient."
Stanford University,Novel Electronic Readout for a 100 ps CTR PET Detector with 24:1 Multiplexing Ratio of Timing Channels,Docket #: S22-317,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/novel-electronic-readout-100-ps-ctr-pet-detector-241-multiplexing-ratio-timing-channels,"Stanford researchers have developed a compact, scalable electronic readout that can multiplex 24 or more fast outputs of each 6x4 SiPM array to only 1 timing channel per detector layer unit. It can do this while maintaining ~100 ps CTR, which can potentially support the world's best CTR TOF-PET system.\nCurrent PET medical imaging systems use large numbers of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) to obtain high resolution results and a good time of flight (TOF) performance. This creates a need for effective and scalable multiplexing readout approaches to reduce the number of electronic channels. Most multiplexing methodologies degrade the fast-timing capabilities necessary for TOF-PET.\nThis novel technology saves resources and reduces complexity without degrading the CTR performance. If successful, a TOF-PET system with 100 ps CTR enables substantial boost in reconstructed image signal-tonoise ratio compared to state-of-the-art TOF-PET systems.\nStage of Development\nProof-of-Concept\nFigure\nFigure description-  Scalable mixed-signal electronic readout scheme for our proposed TOF-PET detectors.\nImage credit:  https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/abf1bc\n\nApplications: TOF-PET scanners, Other applications include:, Autonomous vehicle, Object detection, Active pedestrian safety, Robot navigation, People counting, Other products that employ timing measurements using multiple sensors.\n\nAdvantages: Higher multiplexing ratio than current best available systems, Higher CTR than current best available systems, Over 40% signal-to-noise ratio improvement relative to Siemens Biograph Vision TOF-PET scanner."
Stanford University,Massively Sacalable Viral Testing and Asymptomatic Surveillance,Docket #: S20-342,"Published Application: WO2022076600, Published Application: 20230407418",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/massively-sacalable-viral-testing-and-asymptomatic-surveillance,"Technology Reference\nCZ Biohub Ref. No. CZB-180S-PC\nStanford Ref. No. S20-342\nResearchers at Stanford have developed a method called Identity Preserving Sample Multiplexing (IPSM) for the scaled up and rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects.\nAt the beginning of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, reliably tracking SARS-CoV-2 among patients was a critical step in quarantining, triaging, and treating positive patients. However most hospitals were initially unable to process even 1000 tests per day due to the shortage of reagents and other resources, whereas an order of magnitude or more that number of clinical tests were needed to adequately meet patients' needs. In addition, due to the high positivity rate of tested populations, standard pooling assays (where groups of samples are co-purified and patients in positive groups are re-tested individually) were not appropriate as, by mid-March 2020, up to 25% of tests in highly populated regions such as New York were positive. Therefore, a multiplexed strategy was necessary to allow the scaling up of tests while robustly preserving patient identity.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have designed an approach to non-enzymatically barcode patient samples in large collection volumes and then concentrate those samples within a pooled library. Each barcode consists of three high-melting temperature oligos that anneal at adjacent positions along the viral genome and thereby also provide a position barcode. After annealing barcoding oligos to the target viral RNA, each oligo is then ligated using an RNA-splinted ligation. The ligation product is then amplified and distributed into 2n wells and the abundance of each ligated barcode is then quantified by qPCR with patient-specific primers as a proxy for viral load. Each barcoded patient sample is also redundantly pooled in two non-overlapping patient cohorts along with positive and normalizing controls, providing replicate readouts for each patient's samples.\nStage of Development\nResearch – in vitro\n\nApplications: A unified testing platform for clinical laboratories to dramatically scale up community surveillance and patient diagnostics., Identifying positive patient samples within a pooled population without the need to exhaustively reprocess all patients within positive cohorts..\n\nAdvantages: The assay allows testing with a ligase rather than a reverse-transcriptase enzyme, providing an alternative way to create the template for the qPCR reaction., The assay provides quadruple redundancy to capture measurement noise for both sample barcoding and real-time qPCR., The core workflow with approximately 1000 samples can be completed in ~2.5 hours by a staff of 2-3 people, thereby the inventors' conservative estimate of throughput for this method is 10,000 samples per day for each available 384-well plate qPCR machine., All aspects of the IPSM technology can be implemented using standard equipment and commonly available molecular biology reagents.."
Stanford University,Modulating Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) Signaling in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,Docket #: S19-058,"Published Application: 20220186230, Published Application: 20240102022",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/modulating-bone-morphogenic-protein-bmp-signaling-treatment-alzheimers-disease,"Technology Reference\nStanford ref. no S19-058\nCZ Biohub ref. no. CZB-179S\nResearchers at Stanford University have described a novel therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) presents a large public health burden, effecting an estimated 5.5 million people in the United States and occurring in 10% of individuals over the age of 65. Despite recent advances in therapies targeting plaques (monoclonal antibody therapies), there is currently no treatment currently available that can stop, prevent, or reverse the pathogenesis of AD. Additionally, AD pathology often begins decades before the onset of measurable clinical symptoms or neurologic deficits. In another vein, evidence in the literature suggests that adult neurogenesis is impaired in AD, specifically in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the hippocampus, which may contribute to the neuropathogenesis of this disease. Neural stem/precursor cells (NPC) in this region have been reported to be abrogated in animal models of dementia, but it remains an open question whether this finding is a side effect or a causative factor in AD disease processes.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have defined a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of AD through targeting important molecular pathways in adult NPCs. Through their research, the inventors have discovered that cell-intrinsic NPC deficits are at least partially regulated by Cdkn2a, which has been implicated in tumor formation. To avoid off-target effects, the inventors modulated bone morphogenic protein receptors (BMPRs) which are highly expressed in adult NPCs. By inhibiting BMPR signaling, the inventors determined that BMPR inhibition rescues plaque formation via mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP). Prevention of the formation of mutant APP in turn prevents self-mediated renewal defects in human neurospheres. Taken together, this invention puts forth methods and compositions for treating AD patients with BMPR inhibitors. This invention provides a novel therapeutic pathway for AD, which has the potential to resolve an urgent unmet medical need in the AD field.\nStage of Development\nResearch -\nin vivo\n\nApplications: Targeted, scientifically backed potential treatment avenue for AD using an inhibitor of BMPRs.\n\nAdvantages: Current understanding of BMPR signaling provides evidence of limited off-target effects of inhibition of these receptors, This therapeutic target was discovered using human-derived neurospheres, lending to its applicability for use in humans."
Stanford University,Pulsed Field Atrial Fibrillation System,Docket #: S22-161,Published Application: WO2023244854,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/pulsed-field-atrial-fibrillation-system,"Stanford scientists developed a comprehensive, minimally invasive, dual-catheter pulsed field device that utilizes a rapid and simple integrated mapping/ablation strategy for the treatment of Atrial Fibrillation.\nAtrial Fibrillation (AF), the most common arrhythmia, is an irregular and often rapid heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that can lead to blood clots in the heart. It affects approximately five million Americans for whom medications are ineffective and invasive surgeries to create Cox-Maze surgical lesions to treat AF are often undesirable. Catheter ablation is an alternative to treat AF that is plagued by recurrence of AF, which necessitates repeat catheter ablation to curb future arrhythmias, minimal success with persistent AF, and low long-term success overall. Therefore, a solution is needed that can either recreate the Cox-Maze surgical lesions minimally invasively, better identify critical sites of ablation, or both.\nStanford researchers, therefore, developed a pulsed field atrial fibrillation system that prevents AF recurrences after a single procedure. This simple system creates the set of transmural Cox-Maze surgical lesions and reliably identifies key AF ablation targets not addressed by the Cox-Maze lesion set. This system provides a unified solution absent in most recent AF treatment advances.\nStage of Development\nPrototype\n\nApplications: Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.\n\nAdvantages: More comprehensive system for atrial fibrillation ablation, Extensive lesion set, Incorporates a system for mapping, Minimally invasive, Reduced procedure time, Easy to use."
Stanford University,"Coupling-independent, Real-time Wireless Resistive Sensing through Nonlinear PT-symmetry",Docket #: S20-303,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/coupling-independent-real-time-wireless-resistive-sensing-through-nonlinear-pt-symmetry,"Technology Reference\nCZ Biohub ref. no. CZB-177S\nStanford ref. no. S20-303\nResearchers at Stanford have developed a method for real-time wireless resistive sensing using non-linear PT-symmetry.\nFully passive sensors are lower cost and less complex than their active sensor counterparts. Indeed, fully passive sensors consist of two primary components: an inductor and a sensing element. Sensing elements are either a capacitor or a resistor whose value fluctuates in response to a measurable parameter. This measurable parameter is read in fully passive sensors by magnetically coupling a primary or reader coil to the sensor coil. Sensor measurement is performed by detecting fluctuations in the impedance profile (the effective resistance of an electric circuit or component to alternating current) of the reader coil that corresponds to variations in the sensor. Measuring these fluctuations proves difficult due to the necessity of sizeable lab equipment and the fact that measurements are prone to errors when performed at different distances and orientations. However, when a resonant reader (inductive-capacitive) is tuned to the same resonant frequency as the sensor, it improves the sensitivity of the sensor to fluctuations. This results in impedance fluctuations with sharper features, allowing for more accurate measurements.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors establish a sensing method that enables robust measurement in a real-time, distance immune fashion. This system uses fully passive resistive sensors for coupling independent, powerful wireless sensing. This invention removes the need for sweeping, which allows the system to convey real-time, single point sensing. Self-oscillation remarkably simplifies the reader and is achieved through a fast-settling nonlinearity. This fast-settling nonlinearity has a voltage amplitude that is proportional to the sensor's resistance. Additionally, system analysis is generalized to arbitrary operating conditions through a dual time-scale theoretical framework. Finally, detuning from PT-symmetric conditions by an order of magnitude allows for a robust correction strategy that reduces errors in the system. This technology is largely applicable to health care innovations, specifically wearable, bedside, or point of care health monitoring and sensing due to its cost effective and light-weight properties.\nStage of Development\nResearch- in vitro\n\nApplications: Development of a point-of-care system to measure metrics such as heart rate, temperature, and blood pressure, Development of health care consumer devices for simple, handheld measurement of a user's health conditions, Potential for use in a home healthcare device that could interface to the cloud via legacy technologies such as WiFi or BLE to enable healthcare providers to access real time metrics on their patients' vitals and health records.\n\nAdvantages: Sensing using this system is able to be performed in real time, Sensing using this system is distance and orientation agnostic, This system is lighter and more cost effective than other similar systems available."
Stanford University,Method of Treating Coronavirus Infection,Docket #: S20-215,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/method-treating-coronavirus-infection,"Technology Reference\nStanford ref. no. S20-215\nCZ Biohub ref. no. CZB-171S\nResearchers at Stanford University have developed a novel treatment for coronavirus infection.\nCoronavirus infections are endemic in humans and were the causative pathogen in up to 30% of seasonal upper respiratory infections prior to 2020. Several coronaviruses of interest including MERS, SARS-CoV1, and SARS-CoV2 have emerged in recent years. These novel viruses proved to be infectious to humans and arose ostensibly through zoonotic jumps from both reservoir species (bats) and amplifier species (raccoon dogs, pangolins). Of these novel coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV2 has proved to be especially worrisome, resulting in a world-wide pandemic and 6.8 million deaths as of March 2023. While mRNA vaccines have curtailed infection and mortality rates, few therapeutic drugs exist for those who do become infected. SARS-CoV2 enters cells by binding its Spike protein to the ACE2 receptor which is expressed in a myriad of tissues, including the lungs and epithelial cells that line blood vessels. SARS-CoV2's entrance into cells via the ACE2 receptor is necessary for the virus to be able replicate and cause downstream pathogenic effects.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have identified inhibitors of transmembrane serine protease family member II (TMPRSS2), a known mediator of cell entry of pathogenic coronaviruses. TMPRSS2 is co-expressed in the lung with ACE2, the SARS-CoV2 entry receptor. Briefly, TMPRSS2 proteolyzes the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein at specific cleavage sites following Spike protein binding to ACE2. This cleavage event in turn allows for S2 subunit-driven fusion of viral and host cell membranes, facilitating entry of virus RNA into the cell. Animal studies have shown that inhibition of TMPRSS2 abrogates cellular entry in the lungs of several coronaviruses including MERS and SARS-CoV2. Prior to the filing of this patent, few TMPRSS2 inhibitors have been described in the literature. This invention identifies type II transmembrane serine proteinase (TTSP) inhibitor as a novel therapeutic for SARS-CoV2 infection. Using computationally modeled protein structures and protein ligand interactions, this invention identifies several TTSPs that bind strongly to TMPRSS2.\nStage of Development\nResearch -\nin vivo\n\nApplications: Potential therapeutic for SARS-CoV2 by abrogating cellular entry of the virus via the ACE2 receptor, Potential therapeutic for other coronaviruses that utilize the ACE2 receptor for cellular entry.\n\nAdvantages: Can be administered in addition to other anti-viral drugs for a compounded effect due to differing mechanisms of action, Fills an urgent unmet medical need for therapeutics for those with SARS-CoV2 infections."
Stanford University,Enhanced mammalian CRISPR editing with separated retron donor and nickases,Docket #: S22-282,Published Application: WO2024044736,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/enhanced-mammalian-crispr-editing-separated-retron-donor-and-nickases,"Researchers at Stanford and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) have discovered an improved embodiment of bacterial retron-based CRISPR gene editing in mammalian cells. They found that encoding the retron-based donor sequence and guide RNA (gRNA) sequence in separate expression cassettes allows for more efficient editing than the previously demonstrated embodiments of single fusion retron-gRNA transcripts. This """"split"""" system incorporates distinct promoter and RNA processing elements in the respective retron and gRNA cassettes, allowing for greater control and functionality of each component in the retron gene editing system.\nIn addition, because single-stranded nicks in the host DNA dispel unwanted repair events that commonly occur after double-stranded DNA breaks, the researchers coupled the above split system with the use of a Cas9 nickase rather than a full nuclease. Limiting off-target editing effects in this way is a favorable strategy especially for mammalian editing/therapeutic applications. Strikingly, the researchers found a 2.5-fold increase in editing efficiency with the nickase over the full nuclease, indicating that deleterious impacts of double-strand breaks limit editing efficiency.\nThis improvement on the novel retron-based gene editing system provides greater editing efficiency and greater stability of the individual editing components, which can be useful for gene therapy, research and industrial applications.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Genome editing by homology-directed repair in human cell lines for therapeutic applications, Lineage tracing studies in mammalian systems, Identifying causal genetic variants in multiplexed screens, Engineering organisms, pathways, and proteins for industrial, agricultural, and medical applications.\n\nAdvantages: Less prone to unwanted indels and off-target edits, Highly efficient and flexible by separately tuning the retron and guide RNA elements of the editing system."

MAGESTIC enables thousands of edits to be introduced into a cell population whereby each cell receives a single distinct edit along with a barcode for tracking cell identity and abundance in pooled assays. Now, researchers at Stanford disclose a new enhanced system, titled MAGESTIC 3.0. This new invention is characterized by three orthogonal enhancements to the homology-directed repair (HDR) mechanism for high efficiency gene editing: 1) donor DNA recruitment with the FHA domain of the yeast Forkhead family transcription factor Fkh1p; 2) single-stranded donor DNA synthesis with the bacterial retron system; and 3) in vivo assembly of linearized donor plasmids.

Anti-IL-1/6 therapies are commonly used to treat inflammatory conditions and this finding suggests that HLA testing before prescription, treatment monitoring, and applicable drug safety labeling could improve safety. Misinterpreted as disease flares, Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), a severe delayed hypersensitivity reaction (DHR),  often goes unrecognized in patients with inflammatory illness. Unusual clinical features including severe drug-associated lung disease and rash arising during IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitor treatment of Still's and Still's-like disease across the age spectrum [systemic onset juvenile arthritis (sJIA) and adult onset Stills disease (AOSD)] suggested this serious DHR to the researchers.

Stanford University,Densitometry-based sorting allows the selection of healthier embryos from obese mice,Docket #: S21-136,Published Application: WO2022251582,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/densitometry-based-sorting-allows-selection-healthier-embryos-obese-mice,"Stanford researchers have developed a non-invasive, densitometry-based sorting method to select healthy embryos for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Families and individuals suffering from infertility often turn to Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) to help them conceive and have children. Almost 2% of infants born in the US every year are conceived using ART, with In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) making up the biggest share. A key limitation of IVF procedures is the low success rate of embryonic development. Less than 5% of harvested oocytes result in birth using IVF. Chronic health issues like obesity, which affects half of women of child-bearing age in the US, only further decrease the chances of a successful fertilization, implantation, and embryonic development with IVF procedures. Better methods for selecting healthy embryos are critical for improving the efficacy of IVF, particularly in patients suffering from obesity. Stanford researchers have developed a straightforward, non-invasive method to measure the density of single pre-implantation embryos and have demonstrated that embryo density is predictive of post-implantation growth and fetal development in obese mice models.\n\nApplications: In Vitro Fertilization (IVF), Pre-implantation embryo screening.\n\nAdvantages: Embryo density is fundamentally linked to metabolic state, Can measure density of single embryos, Non-invasive, No need for biomarkers, tags, antibodies."
Stanford University,Sequential fragment-based ligand generation guided by geometric deep learning on protein-ligand structures,Docket #: S22-119,Published Application: 20230317212,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/sequential-fragment-based-ligand-generation-guided-geometric-deep-learning-protein,"Stanford researchers have developed a geometric deep learning based novel method to aid in identification and discovery of novel drug scaffolds as well as to optimize known scaffolds, as a means to combat the major challenge in drug discovery.\nA major challenge after identifying a new drug scaffold is the optimization of the molecule for medicinal use, which is usually both time and resource intensive. Moving the chemical search process from the bench top to a laptop could significantly decrease the time and physical resources that need to be devoted to creating a new drug. The novel in silico method developed by Stanford researchers does exactly that by expanding a small, fragment-like starting molecule bound to a protein pocket into a larger, more drug-like molecule. The model uses E(3) equivariant based neural networks and a 3D atomic point cloud representation, to learn how to attach new functional groups to a growing structure by recognizing realistic intermediates generated en route to a final ligand. The method also accounts for properties like binding affinity, ease of synthesis, and drug-likeness.\nStage of Development \nPrototype\n\nApplications: Identifies new drug scaffolds, Optimizes known scaffolds quickly and inexpensively.\n\nAdvantages: Faster, Cheaper, Learns a complex task from a  relatively small number of independent training examples (4000 protein-ligand pairs), interpretable: the agent's actions often align with a chemist's intuition and basic physics."
Stanford University,Myc degradation by long non coding RNA for cancer therapeutics,Docket #: S22-163,Published Application: WO2023212572,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/myc-degradation-long-non-coding-rna-cancer-therapeutics,"Researchers at Stanford University have discovered that the absence of a long non coding RNA (lnc122) predisposed mice to high numbers of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), and its replacement decreased the risk of HCC. Mechanistic studies revealed that lnc122 acts via degradation of the oncogenic protein Myc. Consequently, methods to increase lnc122 expression can be used to treat a variety of Myc driven and/or dependent cancers.\nDysregulation of the MYC proto-oncogene occurs in ~70% of all human cancers and is linked to poor prognosis. Accordingly, the Myc protein is a transcription factor that is a major driver of tumorigenesis and a well-established cancer target for a variety of cancers, including liver cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, among others. However, inhibition of Myc has proven difficult due to its lack of a traditionally druggable binding pocket and primarily nuclear localization. Alternative methods for targeting Myc are being pursued, such as targeting MYC transcription or mRNA translation, preventing its function as a transcription factor by blocking binding of Myc to chromatin or Max, and promoting Myc degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS). While these strategies are promising and numerous clinical studies are being pursued, there have yet to be approved cancer drugs targeting Myc.\nThis technology offers a contrasting strategy to promote Myc degradation via the UPS. Current approaches to hijack the UPS include proteolysis-targeting chimaeras (PROTACs), which bring the target protein and E3 protein ligase into close proximity with a heterobifunctional molecule. This strategy is difficult in the case of Myc as high affinity ligands for the target protein are required. In contrast, here, the inventors found that a long non coding RNA present in hepatocytes, lnc122, serves as a mediator for E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UBR5-dependent Myc degradation. Specifically, lnc122 enhances the binding of UBR5 to Myc, resulting in ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Myc. While lnc122 is naturally present primarily in liver cells, UBR5-dependent ubiquitination occurs across tissues. Thus, strategies which increase the expression and/or presence of lnc122 can be applied to promote Myc degradation in a variety of tumor types.\nFigure 1. Schematic of lnc122-mediated targeted protein degradation of Myc. (Credit to the inventors)\nStage of Development: In vivo data\n\nApplications: Therapeutics for Myc driven/dependent cancers.\n\nAdvantages: By targeting a driver oncogene/protein such as Myc, therapies can be developed for cancers that currently have no targeted therapies, Tumors are highly dependent on driver oncogenes, making targeting these drivers such as MYC highly promising for significant clinical benefit, Myc is a promising cancer target, but is difficult to target with traditional approaches, such as small molecules and antibodies, Lnc122 enables targeted degradation of Myc via the UPS system and can be applied to a variety of tumor types."

Stanford University,Autonomous multi-port AutoSampler drifter system,Docket #: S23-033,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/autonomous-multi-port-autosampler-drifter-system,"Discrete water sampling is resource and time intensive. It also involves the need for the scientist with or without a vessel to be on site to take the discrete sample. This can often disturb the environment being sampled and potentially disrupt or contaminate the sample of interest. A Stanford researcher has designed an autonomous multi-port AutoSampler drifter system to replace the need for manual water sampling in a wide range of aquatic environments. As the system drifts with the water current, this system uses a peristaltic pump and a suite of valves to sample water at a predetermined set depth and time and records the GPS location of each sample. This type of sampling is key to obtaining water samples that can be used for chemical or biological analysis and for Lagrangian based research studies. The system uses rechargeable Ni-cd battery packs, eInk display, GPS module, 16-channel relay board, and real-time clock, 1.2 L/min peristaltic pump, and up to 12 sampling valves.\nStage of Development \nProof of concept: prototype has been successfully field tested\n\nApplications: Academic research in marine and freshwater systems, Aquariums – e.g., as a stationary sampler, Water management (e.g EPA, state agencies, consulting), Aquaculture.\n\nAdvantages: Replaces manual water sampling, Collect samples without contamination and bias, GPS module obtains the time and fix of each sample collected and records the drift pathway, Rapid sampling (1 mL/min), Rechargeable, long lasting batteries, Can be used as a drifter or a stationary sampling system, Lightweight, Scalable."
Stanford University,NeuMapper: a scalable computational framework for modeling brain dynamics,Docket #: S21-295,Published Application: 20230112375,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/neumapper-scalable-computational-framework-modeling-brain-dynamics,"Stanford inventors have created a novel, interactive, highly scalable computational approach for representing dynamic brain activity as a network for use in clinical settings.\nNeuroimaging is essential to understanding human brain function in health and disease. Clinicians and researchers generate large volumes of neuroimaging data from various modalities, including fMRI, that require extensive processing to be interpretable. Therefore, it is necessary to develop computational tools to create simple representations from complex, high-dimensional neuroimaging data. These simple representations can then be utilized in research and clinical settings. Previously, Stanford inventors developed an approach using the Mapper algorithm from topological data analysis (TDA) to generate these simple representations for neuroimaging data (Saggar et al. 2018; Geniesse et al. 2019; Saggar et al. 2022).\nIn this current method, Stanford inventors sought to extend the capabilities of their previous work and its applications to large-scale neuroimaging datasets (Geniesse, Chowdhury, and Saggar, 2022). They modified the underlying algorithm—improving its scalability and simplifying parameter selection—to accelerate and enable applications involving high-dimensional neuroimaging data. The new, scalable Mapper algorithm can create interactive network representations of dynamic brain activity data. It is also capable of operating on large repositories of high-dimensional neuroimaging data (i.e., thousands of individuals' full-length scans). They also developed new analytical tools for annotating and extracting neurobiological and behavioral insights from the generated representations, including a new way to compare different representations using techniques from optimal transport theory. Hence, they hope to facilitate the translation of precision neuroimaging to clinical settings—by enabling the fast construction of interpretable and interactive representations of individuals' data.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Generates an interpretable report from a functional brain scan., Suggests features of clinical significance to the psychiatrist, along with a clear decision path leading to these features..\n\nAdvantages: It is a scalable, nonlinear Mapper algorithm that can operate on large data repositories., It improves on an existing algorithm (from TDA) and a previous approach (using TDA) to neuroimaging data analysis.."

Injuries and diseases of the cornea blind millions of people every year by causing permanent scarring and neovascularization.  These engineered growth factor variants act as receptor antagonists to neovascularization and fibrotic cumulation.  This therapy has been successfully tested with animal models by evaluating daily corneal wound repair after an induced alkali burn.  Compared to current ocular therapeutics, the engineered growth factors showed superior efficacy and stability properties (compared to wild-type proteins) to treat corneal diseases with epithelial defects, infections, burns, scarring, and neovascularization (such as, but not limited to contact lens over wear, limbal cell stem deficiency, Steven-Johnson Syndrome, and herpetic disease).  Corneal diseases are the 2nd leading cause of blindness (cataracts are #1).  Hence, with more predictable and efficacious therapies like this one, treatment of these types of corneal diseases will help to prevent functional blindness on a global scale.\nStage of Development:\n\nApplications: Treatment and/or prevention of corneal burns: represents 11.5-22.1% of all ocular traumas, Treatment and/or prevention of corneal neovascularization: affects approximately 1.4 million patients per year (Massachusetts Eye and Ear/Harvard Medical School study), Examples of visual impairment due to corneal epithelial defects or neovascularization: Contact lens over wear, limbal cell stem deficiency, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, infections, and herpetic disease.\n\nAdvantages: Superior efficacy in inhibiting vascularization and scarring of the cornea compared to current standard therapies, Only one amino acid mutation so an immune response is reduced, Ability to treat a vast range of ocular conditions susceptible to aberrant vascularization (driven by growth factor ligand/receptor signaling)."
Stanford University,Inducing TCL1A Expression to Increase Proliferation and Prolong Stemness of Hematopoietic Stem Cells,Docket #: S22-269,Published Application: WO2024039600,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/inducing-tcl1a-expression-increase-proliferation-and-prolong-stemness-hematopoietic-stem,"One of the main shortcomings of the clinical use of Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) is the limited number of cells that can be safely harvested from a patient. Inventors at Stanford have achieved over-expression of TCL1A in HSCs,thereby, increasing proliferation of HSCs, increasing their self-renewing capacity, and improving their resiliency.\nAdditional shortcomings of stem cell transplantation include, limited availability of suitable donor tissue, increased risk of lethal infections during the extended engraftment period, intensive caustic chemotherapy to provide a niche for donor cells and stressful genetic editing of blood cells. Current solutions including using multiple units of donor tissue and high dose antibiotics, supportive care and using high cell numbers to compensate for expected loss are not ideal. The ideal solution would be  effective ex vivo expansion of HSCs, faster engraftment kinetics, more competitive HSCs that don't require niche to be cleared and more resilient HSCs that can endure genetic editing. Stanford researchers have identified one such ideal solution via endogenous temporary expression of TCL1A, which plays a role in cell survival and proliferation. This discovery can be put to therapeutic use by designing TCL1A mRNA or protein paired with appropriate delivery methods to temporarily drive TCL1A expression in HSCs.\nStage of Development \nIn vivo: Transplant of TCL1A overexpressing HSCs dramatically improved survival of mice following a lethal total body radiation conditioning regime\n\nApplications: HSC transplantation, HSC gene editing.\n\nAdvantages: Novel method, Expansion of HSCs ex vivo or in vivo, Tunable temporal expression of TCL1A, Expedite engraftment of autologous and allogeneic transplants, Reduce chemotherapy required for successful engraftment, Expand and expedite engraftment of edited cells, Improve HSC survival during genetic editing process, TCL1A may also have regenerative effects in other tissues stem cell types as well."

Improved peptide sequences could boost vaccine effectiveness, but sequence optimization methods are currently limited to painstaking cell-based screens and poorly validated in silico prediction. These efforts are limited by a lack of understanding of the proteosome processing step that occurs before peptides are presented as extracellular antigens.\nTo address this need, researchers in the Wong lab have developed design principles and screening methods that produce peptides with enhanced proteosome processing and cancer immunization. One improvement in sequence optimization comes from the inclusion of proteasome catalyzed peptide splicing (PCPS), which has been previously overlooked as a major determinant of proteosome activity.\nStage of Development Pre-clinical. Using novel design and screening methods, the researchers have identified EGFRvIII and SARS-CoV-2 peptide vaccines with improved proteosomal processing. In a mouse glioblastoma model, the EGFRvIII vaccine yields increased survival over the non-optimized peptide. The screening method, which includes in vitro and in silico steps, is ready to use for any intended target.\n\nApplications: Improved peptide vaccines against:, EGFRvIII-expressing cancer, such as glioblastoma, SARS-CoV-2, Development of peptide vaccines with enhanced proteosome processing, Diagnostic reagents to assess vaccine effectiveness using patient PBMCs.\n\nAdvantages: Improved anti-glioblastoma efficacy due to increased proteosome processing, More accurate and rapid identification of T cell epitopes, Identifies large pool of PCPS products (ignored in previous methods), In vitro and in silico combined method is faster than cell-based approach."
Stanford University,Blastocyst microglia complementation for in vivo microglia manipulation and validation of gene function,Docket #: S22-313,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/blastocyst-microglia-complementation-vivo-microglia-manipulation-and-validation-gene,"Stanford scientists have developed an accurate, rapid, and efficient tool for in vivo microglial manipulation to validate gene functions after transcriptomic analysis.\nMicroglia heterogeneity and function in health and disease remains an important and elusive question. RNA Sequencing has revolutionized the transcriptomic analysis of microglia, and the scientific community has churned out large RNA-sequencing microglial datasets. However, follow-up studies manipulating microglia in vivo to validate functions inferred from RNA-sequencing data are needed. Current tools for microglial manipulation include various genetically modified mouse models, all of which are time-intensive and are infeasible for screening multiple candidate genes from transcriptomic datasets if one is financially- and space-constrained. There is a need for an efficient tool that allows accurate microglial manipulation in vivo to validate transcriptomic analysis findings.\nStanford scientists, therefore, developed a non-human animal comprising chimeric microglia and precise methods of performing blastocyst microglia complementation to produce non-human chimeric animals. These methods can be used to create a non-human animal model carrying microglia mutations of interest for gene validation and therapeutic screening.\nBy injecting pluripotent stem cells (PSCs, e.g., ES cells or iPS cells) into mouse embryos that cannot produce microglia, it is possible to create mice in which all microglia are derived from PSCs during natural development. By injecting PSCs with various genetic modifications, the effects of genetic modifications on microglial development and function can be studied.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Method for chimeric animal generation., Microglial manipulation for research purposes..\n\nAdvantages: Animals can be prepared within four months. Faster than current methods., Can proceed with multiple target genes at the same time., Efficient gene manipulation, Accurate, Specific."
Stanford University,"CDK19- Selective Inhibitors, and Methods of Use thereof",Docket #: S20-084,Published Application: 20240270735,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/cdk19-selective-inhibitors-and-methods-use-thereof,"Researchers at Stanford University have identified new CDK19-selective inhibitors for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer.\nBreast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. While early cancer detection methods such as genetic biomarker screening and regular mammograms have significantly reduced breast cancer mortality in resource-rich settings, treatment options have lagged. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) refers to breast cancer that is estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 negative and is known to have significantly worse treatment outcomes than other breast cancer subtypes, reducing median survival time by 13 months. This decreased survival time is in part due to available treatment strategies as TNBC is unable to be treated with target-specific therapies. Subsequently, the only treatment available to TNBC patients are non-specific treatments such as chemotherapy, which is often less effective, highly cytotoxic, and results in long-term sequelae. Cyclin-dependent kinases, specifically CDK19 and its related isoform CDK8, form complexes with other proteins to regulate RNA polymerase association and transcriptional activity. Compounds that inhibit both CDK19 and CDK8 have been of interest in recent years as anti-cancer therapies, including in TNBC. However, these targets have been abandoned due to off-target effects of CDK8 inhibition, likely caused by its wider tissue distribution as compared to CDK19. A compound that selectively inhibits CDK19 while limiting off-target inhibition of CDK8 has not yet been described in the literature. Given the current lack of treatment options, there is an urgent unmet need to investigate potential therapeutic targets for TNBC.\nStage of Development\nResearch-\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors isolated and characterized a number of compounds that selectively inhibit CDK19 over CDK8. These compounds were assayed using FRET displacement to determine CDK19 selectivity indexes (CDK19 IC50 / CD8K IC50). It was determined that many of the isolated compounds had high CDK19 selectivity, with compound A4 performing exceptionally well with a selectivity index of greater than 50. Furthermore, treatment with CDK19-selective inhibitors in an in vitro TNBC cell line resulted in significant cell death, indicating its efficacy in killing TNBC cancer cells. When CDK19-selective inhibitors were incubated with a human fibroblast cell line in vitro, they did not exhibit significant cell death as compared to controls, suggesting that CDK19-selective inhibitors are not broadly cytotoxic. Indeed, when patient-derived TNBC organoids were treated with compound A4 and subsequently allowed to regrow without pharmacological intervention, TNBC cancer cells failed to regrow when compared to organoids treated with a non-selective CDK19/CDK8 inhibitor and DMSO negative controls. Taken together, these studies suggest that CDK19 selective inhibitors described by the inventors are promising therapeutic candidates for TNBC, with compound A4 being especially promising.\nTechnology Reference\nStanford ref. no. S20-084\nCZ Biohub ref. no. CZB-162S\n\nApplications: Targeted, non-cytotoxic therapeutic for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).\n\nAdvantages: In vitro studies suggest that these compounds are not broadly cytotoxic, These compounds are a targeted therapy, which lends to them being a more effective treatment option than non-specific TNBC therapies such as chemotherapy, The compounds described by the inventors selectively inhibit CDK19 over CDK8, leading to fewer off-target effects."
Stanford University,High-Throughput Force-Dependent Cellular Response Assay Using Spectrally Encoded Smart Beads,Docket #: S20-110,"Published Application: WO2022094219, Published Application: 20230384308",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/high-throughput-force-dependent-cellular-response-assay-using-spectrally-encoded-smart,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a technology that uses biomechanical force to initiate T-cell triggering in a high throughput method, facilitating the exploration of the force- and sequence-dependent landscape of T-cell responses.\nAdaptive immunity relies on the ability of T-cells to sensitively discriminate self from non-self, and to thereby detect pathogen infection or malignant transformations. This discrimination hinges on the ability of T-cell receptors (TCR) to recognize specific peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules expressed on antigen presenting cells, which triggers downstream signaling events and T-cell effector functions. However, the relationship between TCR binding and triggering is not fully understood. For instance, measured in vitro affinities with a presented peptide do not always correlate with stimulation of T-cell activity, as some of the most potent stimulatory peptides bind with only weak or moderate affinities. Recent evidence suggests that the pN to nN biomechanical forces generated at the TCR-pMHC interface during T-cell immunosurveillance and synapse formation may be critical for sensitive and specific recognition. Distinguishing agonist peptides from non-agonist peptides therefore requires an in vitro assay in the presence of applied loads that quantifies binding and downstream activation. Currently available screening approaches can only quantify peptide binding alone, and not T-cell activation, and they take place in the absence of force and present peptides at artificially high concentrations, thereby reducing their physiological relevance. Several mechanobiology methods exist that can exert well-calibrated shear loads on T-cells interacting with specific pMHCs displayed at low densities, however these techniques typically require expensive equipment, are labor intensive, and are limited in peptide throughput. A peptide screening method that could probe both TCR binding and triggering at a high throughput level is needed.\nStage of Development\nResearch –\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a novel technology called BATTLES for Biomechanically-Assisted T-cell Triggering for Large-scale Exogenous-pMHC Screening. This technique profiles T-cell signaling responses for thousands of cells interacting with different pMHCs at low densities and in the presence of physiological shear loads within a single experiment.

Currently, a promising approach is moving from lithium-ion batteries, for which current technologies are close to the energy density theoretical limit, to new materials. Anodes composed of lithium metal, instead of the traditional graphite, have been shown to increase anode specific capacity by about 10-fold. Yet, commonly used electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries are incompatible with lithium metal anodes. Recently developed electrolytes that are compatible with lithium metal often have limitations including low initial Columbic efficiencies, slow ion transport properties, incompatibility with high-voltage cathodes, and expensive salts and/or solvents that limit scalability.\nWhen combined with commonly used salts, the fluorinated acetal electrolyte based formulations in this technology can overcome many of these challenges faced by current electrolytes. Fast stabilization of lithium metal provides high Columbic efficiencies (greater than 99%) within the first 10 cycles. Fast ion transport properties result in low cell impendence. The electrolytes display good compatibility with existing high-voltage cathodes. Finally, the fluorinated acetals are synthesized in high yields from common chemical feedstocks and are combined with standard inexpensive salts, enabling cost-effective and scalable electrolyte production. Altogether, the improved electrolytes offer improvements that could aid in the translation of lithium metal batteries to widespread use.\nStage of Development Proof of concept\n\nApplications: Electrolyte formulations for lithium metal batteries.\n\nAdvantages: Fast stabilization of lithium metal cycling, Low cell impedance, Compatibility with existing cathodes, Inexpensive and scalable production."
Stanford University,Methods and Compositions Related to Lanthanide-encoded Microbeads,Docket #: S20-157,"Published Application: WO2021252735, Published Application: 20230211307",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/methods-and-compositions-related-lanthanide-encoded-microbeads,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed a bespoke method for multiplexing beads in bioassays that expands the possible coding space when compared to available bead barcoding technologies.\nMultiplexed bioassays have drastically improved our understanding of complex biological process in recent years. In these assays, binding is measured between a single """"bait"""" molecule and many """"prey"""" molecules to provide a comprehensive understanding of interactome networks. While spatial arrays comprised the first generation of these technologies, they have been outpaced by multiplexed microbead assays which allow for many replicates per experiment, opportunities for quality control, and the ability to vary different probes and targets over multiple experiments. Spectrally encoded microbeads assays such as the Luminex platform use microbeads that are combined in ratiometric proportions with fluorescent or luminescent materials. However, these techniques have a limited possible coding space, are often ill-suited for solid-phase synthesis applications due to their incompatibility with harsh organic solvents, and have difficulty detecting low affinity interactions.\nStage of Development\nResearch-\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have created a novel technology named MRBLES 2.0, an acronym for microspheres with ratiometric barcode lanthanide encoding. This technology involves ratiometrically incorporating lanthanide phosphors (Lns) to produce spectrally encoded beads. The previous iteration of MRBLES had complex production pipelines that required two-layer microfluidic devices with custom pneumatics control hardware and resulted in slow and laborious bead generation. However, MRBLES 2.0 utilizes manual mixing of Lns and polymers followed by droplet generation using a single-layer parallel flow-focusing device that increases the throughput of the assay from ~6600 beads/hour generated to ~9,000,000 beads/hour. MRBLES 2.0 also allows for the localization of copolymers bearing functional groups used for bioconjugation to the surface of the hydrogel matrix during droplet generation, allowing this method of bead generation to be used in applications requiring bioconjugation. MRBLES 2.0 provides an innovative, high throughput method for the generation of barcoded beads that expands the possible coding space as well as allows for additional applications with the addition of bioconjugation capabilities.\nTechnology Reference\nStanford ref. no S20-157; CZ Biohub ref. no.

Stanford University,Methods and Compositions for Selective PCR and Cloning of Antibody Sequences,Docket #: S20-179,"Published Application: WO2021257550, Published Application: 20230227816",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/methods-and-compositions-selective-pcr-and-cloning-antibody-sequences,"Researchers at Stanford University and the CZ Biohub San Francisco have developed a strategy for retrieving and cloning antibody DNA from single cells within a pooled library of cells, enabling the rapid and low-cost cloning and expression of native human antibodies for functional characterization.\nThe characterization of antibody binding properties, including specificity and affinity, is essential for understanding the recognition capability of the immune system and discovering antibodies for research and therapeutics. Characterization of antibody binding requires recombinant cloning and expression of purified protein for use in functional assays, however current methods are insufficient. Single-cell approaches enable high-throughput determination of native antibody sequences, yet sequence information alone is not sufficient to predict antibody specificity and affinity. Droplet- and micro-well-based single-cell techniques can identify over ten thousand natively paired antibody heavy- and light-chain gene sequences in one experiment. However, producing antibody DNA by gene synthesis is costly and time consuming compared to complementary DNA (cDNA) cloning, while current methods for producing cDNA pool thousands of cells, rendering isolation of antibody cDNA from individual cells difficult. Therefore, a method for the simultaneous high-throughput determination of antibody sequences and the rapid cloning and expression of individual antibodies from suitable antibody cDNA is needed.\nStage of Development\nResearch -\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors created a strategy for cloning antibody heavy- and light-chain cDNA from a single B cell within a pooled library called selective PCR for antibody retrieval (SPAR). The technique leverages the unique sequence barcodes attached to cDNA molecules during sample preparation, which typically include a cell barcode (CBC) to distinguish individual cells and a unique molecular identifier (UMI) used to distinguish individual molecules of template RNA. After sequencing, the antibody heavy- and light-chain sequences and their corresponding sequences barcodes are identified. The barcodes and the heavy- and light-chain sequences are then used as unique molecular tags to retrieve cDNA from an individual cell. The inventors showed through computational analysis that most human antibodies sequenced using typical high-throughput methods can also be retrieved using SPAR, and that retrieval of full-length antibody variable region cDNA from three cells within pools of ~5,000 cells is possible.\nTechnology Reference\nChan Zuckerberg CZB-166S-PC, Stanford S20-179\n\nApplications: Rapid low-cost cloning and expression of native human antibodies from pooled single-cell sequence libraries for functional characterization., Retrieval of full-length antibody variable region cDNA from single cells..\n\nAdvantages: Antibodies that are selected based on sequence or phenotype can be cloned and expressed directed from a pooled cDNA library with SPAR., SPAR costs ~$70 per antibody, which is cheaper than or similarly priced to gene synthesis., SPAR can be performed within ~29 hours, which is much faster than the several weeks required for gene synthesis.."
Stanford University,MEASUREMENT OF AFUCOSYLATED IgG Fc GLYCANS TO PREDICT RISK OF SEVERE COVID-19 DISEASE,Docket #: S20-208,"Published Application: WO2021231304, Published Application: 20230176068",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/measurement-afucosylated-igg-fc-glycans-predict-risk-severe-covid-19-disease,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a method for identifying a subject that is at risk of progression to clinically significant COVID-19 infection or disease.\nA minority of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 mount an extreme inflammatory response that is implicated in the disease's pathogenesis. Mechanisms contributing to this response are not well understood. Antibodies formed early during infection can bind virus particles, forming immune complexes that neutralize or mediate clearance of virus. However, immune complexes can also promote inflammation and exacerbate symptoms of disease via interactions between antibody Fc domains and Fc gamma receptors, particularly on myeloid cells, which are central regulators of the inflammatory response. How antibodies within immune complexes modulate infection depends, in part, on their Fc domain structure. IgG is the dominant antibody isotype in systemic antiviral immunity. The inventors and others have found that a high abundance of afucosylated IgG antibodies is linked to severe COVID-19, however whether afucosylated IgG production is a consequence of, or an antecedent to, the development of more severe COVID-19 remained unclear.\nStage of Development\nResearch –\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nTwo independent cohorts were assessed during an initial period of mild COVID-19 and it was found that the absence of neutralizing antibodies and an increased abundance of afucosylated IgG was associated with a rapid progression to more severe disease. Elevated frequencies of monocytes expressing the receptor for afucosylated IgG, CD16a, were also associated with more severe outcomes. Immune complexes formed from SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine-elicited IgG did not trigger the robust immune activation that was associated with afucosylated IgG in vivo. The researchers have therefore established a method for determining that a subject is symptomatic or prone to present one or more symptoms of COVID-19 and at risk of progression to clinically significant COVID-19 infection.\nTechnology Reference\nCZB-169S-PC, S20-208\n\nApplications: Elevated production of afucosylated IgG was found to precede onset of severe disease symptoms, and stayed high over time., Combining searches for early non-neutralizing titers and afucosylated anti-spike IgG could separate progressors from non-progressors towards severe disease with higher accuracy than either attribute alone., mRNA vaccination elicits the production of neutralizing IgG with glycoforms that are distinct from those elicited by infection.\n\nAdvantages: The development of prognostic biomarkers and clarification in the mechanisms underlying the distinct trajectories in COVID-19 may help halt disease progression to severe COVID-19., A method to identify subjects who are prone to progress to severe COVID-19 disease.."
Stanford University,Total RNA Profiling of Biological Samples and Single Cells,Docket #: S20-209,"Published Application: WO2021236963, Published Application: 20230193254",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/total-rna-profiling-biological-samples-and-single-cells,"Researchers at Stanford and CZ Biohub San Francisco have developed a method capable of assaying a broad spectrum of coding and noncoding RNA from a single cell, thus enabling simultaneous analysis of protein-coding, long-noncoding, microRNA and other noncoding RNA transcripts from single cells.\nCharacterizing the transcriptional state of single cells has primarily focused on protein-coding RNA. However, a growing number of studies indicate that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are actively involved in cell function and specialization. In addition, protein-coding RNA is transcribed from only 1-2% of the genome, whereas ncRNA covers ~70% of the genomic content and the majority of all cellular transcripts. The role of these transcripts in shaping different cell types and states remains poorly understood. Current techniques aimed at measuring ncRNA in single cells can only target a certain subset of noncoding transcripts, and no current method can simultaneously quantify all RNA types within a cell. Thus, the ability to map the regulatory connection between coding and noncoding transcripts within a cell is limited. This gap motivates the need for a novel single cell technology capable of assaying both poly(A)+ and poly(A)- RNA, irrespective of transcript length.\nStage of Development\nResearch –\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors developed a """"one-pot"""" scalable method designed to capture both coding and noncoding transcripts regardless of their length. This method, named Smart-seq-total, harnesses the template-switching capability of MMLV reverse transcriptase to generate full-length cDNA with high yield and quality. Smart-seq-total captures nonpolyadenylated RNA through template-independent addition of poly(A) tails, and further oligo-dT priming of all cellular transcripts, meaning all RNA molecules can also be tagged with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). SMART-seq-total thereby quantifies mRNA and other types of RNA in the same cell.\nTechnology Reference\nCZB-170S-PC, S20-209\n\nApplications: The annotation of cell types and states based on integration of mRNA data with other existing scRNA-seq datasets., The discovery of non-coding regulatory patterns of the respective cell types and states..\n\nAdvantages: The sensitivity of Smart-seq-total estimated based on external RNA control consortium capture is comparable to Smart-seq2., Smart-seq-total detects a broader spectrum of RNA types than previous single-cell approaches., Smart-seq-total allows the incorporation of UMIs for absolute quantitation into both short and long RNA molecules.."
Stanford University,Methods for Measuring Protein-DNA Interactions with Long-read DNA Sequencing,Docket #: S21-140,"Published Application: WO2022256469, Published Application: 20240240234",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/methods-measuring-protein-dna-interactions-long-read-dna-sequencing,"Researchers at the University of California Berkeley and Stanford have developed a bespoke, high throughput method for determining DNA-protein interactions in highly repetitive portions of the human genome.\nProtein-DNA interactions are essential to the reading, regulation, and replication of genomic DNA. Systematic mapping of these interactions provides key insights into vital cellular functions in both healthy and disease states. Current approaches to determining genome-wide interactions with a protein of interest (ChIP-Seq, CUT & RUN) were developed using short-read next generation sequencing (NGS), where short reads (~200bp) are mapped to a reference genome by stitching together uniquely overlapping sequencing reads. However, some highly repetitive regions of the human genome are unable to be correctly assembled using this technology because short repetitive sequences often lack unique overlaps that assembly algorithms rely upon. Long-read sequencing technology has made it possible to assemble some of these genomic regions for the first time as recently as 2020, and has elucidated their role key biological processes including chromosome segregation, nuclear organization, and transcriptional regulation. Additionally, current techniques rely on amplification-based readouts which have intrinsic biases and therefore only provide a semi-quantitative picture of protein-DNA interaction frequencies.\nStage of Development\nResearch-\nin vitro\nStage of Research\nThe inventors of the new method, DiMeLo-Seq, establish a novel way to quantify DNA-protein interactions in previously unexplored, highly repetitive portions of the human genome. This method combines elements of previously established antibody-directed protein-DNA mapping techniques with nanopore sequencing to elucidate interactions. Briefly, cells are permeabilized and incubated with a primary antibody to target a DNA-interacting protein of interest. Next, a non-specific deoxyadenosine methyltransferase fused with antibody binding protein A (pA-Hia5) is allowed to bind to the primary antibody and all unbound pA-Hia5 is washed away. Nuclei are then incubated with methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which allows for adenosine methylation near the protein interaction of interest. Finally, DNA is isolated and sequenced using modification sensitive long-read sequencing to detect the frequency of adenosine methylation in genomic regions of interest, providing a quantitative readout of genomic sites of protein-DNA interaction.\nTechnology Reference\nCZ Biohub ref. no. CZB-205B\nStanford ref. no. S21-140\nUCB ref. no. BK2021-127\n\nApplications: Map multiple DNA-protein interaction sites on single DNA molecules, Infer protein interaction frequency at each genomic site across cells, Map haplotype-specific DNA interactions with proteins of interest, Identify protective or maladaptive DNA-protein interactions in healthy and disease states.\n\nAdvantages: This technology is able to map DNA-protein interactions in previously unexplored, highly repetitive portions of the genome up to 1,000 kilobases in length, Method allows for fully quantitative measurements of DNA-protein interactions whereas other current methods are only semi-quantitative, Compatible with both Oxford Nanopore and PacBio high fidelity (HiFi) sequencing technologies."
Stanford University,TLR agonists Comprising Saponin Nanoparticle Vaccine Adjuvants Improve Immunomodulation,Docket #: S22-243,Published Application: WO2023235592,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/tlr-agonists-comprising-saponin-nanoparticle-vaccine-adjuvants-improve-immunomodulation,"Stanford researchers have developed saponin lipid-based nanoparticles in which both toll-like receptor agonists (TLRas) and other potent molecular adjuvants can be encapsulated to improve vaccine potency, increase antibody titers, and induce more robust neutralizing antibody responses.\nVaccine development to combat severe infectious diseases is essential to human survival. An ever-present threat of new pandemic viral strains like the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its related variants necessitates the development of more potent and protective vaccines. Scientists favor subunit vaccines that use representative pathogen fragments as antigens for their higher safety. Unfortunately, these subunit vaccines are hampered by their weak immunogenicity. Immune stimulating-adjuvants such as toll-like receptor agonists (TLRas) are usually added to elicit stronger antibody responses and better immune memory. Subunit vaccines can also be packaged in nanoparticles which contribute to vaccine potency, quality, and durability.\nStanford inventors have therefore designed saponin lipid-based nanoparticles (SNPs) to encapsulate TLRas and other potent molecular adjuvants concurrently. SNPs have improved potency, producing higher antibody titers and stronger neutralizing antibody responses when different adjuvants are co-presented in the same nanoparticle construct. The inventors used three different TLRas adjuvants, namely Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPLA, TLRa 4), Pam3CSK4 (TLRa 1/2), and lipid based R848 derivative (TLRa 7/8).\nStage of Development\nResearch - in vivo\n\nApplications: TLRas-SNPs can be used as vaccine adjuvants..\n\nAdvantages: Stable at 4°C for several weeks., Result in a stronger immune response in the body compared to clinically used adjuvant systems., Inventors developed two novel formulations of TLRas comprising SNPs.."
Stanford University,A Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) improves downstream signaling of causal genes for Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and improves endothelial function,Docket #: S22-380,Published Application: WO2024112656,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-tki-improves-downstream-signaling-causal-genes-hereditary,"The inventors discovered that a known small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor may correct the errant signaling pathways in the rare diseases Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). The compound therefore presents a solution for disease regression and cure, for which an approved solution does not currently exist for neither HHT nor PAH.\nHHT is an inherited rare disease that affects roughly 1 in 5,000 people worldwide, and is marked by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the lungs, brain, liver, gastrointestinal tract, nasal mucosa, and skin. These AVMs lead to recurrent nosebleeds in 90% of patients, as well as telangiectasia formation and severe anemia. The inventors show that this TKI targets gene signatures of the disease state, and reverses downstream targets of the errant pathway. It is also shown in an ex vivo endothelial disease model that this TKI inhibits tube formation and proliferation in endothelial cells, suggesting it can also treat HHT by reducing angiogenesis.\nIncidence of PAH worldwide is 1 in every 20,000 to 60,000 individuals. Yet, only 15-20% of patients have the inherited form of the disease, caused mainly by loss-of-function mutation in the BMPR2 signaling pathway. In addition, there is evidence that BMPR2 expression and signaling is downregulated in other, non-hereditary forms of PAH as well. Separately from the drug screen for HHT, this same TKI was also nominated as a treatment for PAH as an activator of the BMP pathway that reverses endothelial dysfunction.\n\nApplications: Treatment of nosebleeds and severe anemia in HHT patients, Treatment of AVMs (and therefore a reversal of the disease), especially in the harder to reach GI tract, Correction of endothelial dysfunction in PAH.\n\nAdvantages: A therapeutic approach less invasive than other options such as: ablation, skin grafts, embolization, and nasal closure surgery, By addressing the underlying disease signaling pathway, this TKI presents a curative option rather than just a treatment of symptoms, Dual action of treating HHT as both a: 1) VEGF inhibitor; and 2) signaling modulator."
Stanford University,"Structure-Guided ChRmine mutants (hs, rs and hs/rs) for red-shifted and high-speed optical activation",Docket #: S21-455,Published Application: WO2023141625,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/structure-guided-chrmine-mutants-hs-rs-and-hsrs-red-shifted-and-high-speed-optical,"Stanford researchers have solved the Cryo-EM structure of a powerful new optogenetic actuator, ChRmine, and have successfully used structure guided design to create three new proteins: rsChRmine, hsChRmine and hs/rs ChRmine, conferring red-shifted, high-speed and a combination speed+ red-shifted performance, respectively.\nChRmine, is a light-gated cation-conducting channelrhodopsin, with desirable properties for optogenetic applications including  large photocurrents, red-shifted action spectrum, and extreme light-sensitivity. Optogenetics is a technique where genes for light-sensitive proteins are introduced into target brain cells in order to monitor and control their activity precisely using light signals. The new high speed, red shifted ChRmines created by Stanford researchers marks a notable breakthrough in blue shoulder reduction of channelrhodopsins, a challenge that the field has been contending for over fifteen years.

CLIP makes it possible to manufacture highly precise micro-architectures at high speed, as compared to conventional 3D-printing methods.\nLattice microarray patches (L-MAPs) are novel systems for minimally invasive transdermal drug delivery and sampling of interstitial fluid (ISF). L-MAP design is made flexible by varying lattice cell size and strut size, as well as by varying the surface properties of the lattice structure. In doing so, the amount of solid or liquid cargo that is loaded onto the L-MAPs can be controlled. In addition, this design can also dictate the amount of ISF sample that can be drawn into the lattice. Additionally, because CLIP is a continuous, single-step production process, L-MAPs can also combine different features on a single patch, such as needle size and geometry. Manufacturing these complex designs using the aforementioned high resolution CLIP greatly expands the potential for therapeutic drug delivery and diagnostic applications with microarray patches.\nStage of Development: Prototype\n\nApplications: Self-administration of drugs and vaccines – can be employed in low-resource settings, Transdermal diagnostics.\n\nAdvantages: Continuous manufacturing process, Increased drug loading volume from increase in cell surface area, Liquid droplet drug delivery of any therapeutic type, Greater mechanical stability."
Stanford University,Brain-machine interfaces for seizure detection leveraging information theory,Docket #: S17-071,Published Application: 20230310857,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/brain-machine-interfaces-seizure-detection-leveraging-information-theory,"Stanford inventors have developed an information theoretic, seizure detection algorithm for electroencephalography (EEG) towards improving diagnosis, management, and treatment of patients with epilepsy.\nEpilepsy affects approximately 1% of the world's population, and when inadequately treated, it carries a lifetime risk of mortality of approximately 25%. About a fifth to a third of epilepsy patients are refractory to treatment, and many patients undergo intracranial neuromonitoring studies, involving surgically implanted electrodes in the brain, to localize their seizure source. Treatment options for patients with refractory focal epilepsy include surgical resection, laser ablation, vagal nerve stimulation, and responsive neurostimulation. However, there is no guarantee that a patient will become seizure-free with most of these treatments. Better diagnostic tools are needed to guide clinical interventions and management of patients with epilepsy.\nStanford researchers, therefore, developed an algorithm that informs seizure activity to better diagnose, manage, and treat patients with epilepsy. The method detects seizures using information theoretic estimates of joint entropy by leveraging data compression. It is purely an algorithm (transformation) that requires no supervised learning, model fitting, or training data. Automatic seizure detection based on objective measures can speed up and improve manual EEG reviews. Reliable biomarkers for seizure activity enable device-based therapies that programmatically stimulate and disrupt seizures once detected. This approach has been reduced to practice on intracortical data and also has been preliminarily confirmed on ECoG and surface EEG recordings.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept & reduced to practice on intracortical data\n\nApplications: Clinical monitoring for patients with epilepsy., Automated seizure detection, Validation/verification of manual review of EEG data.\n\nAdvantages: Higher performance than existing model-free methods.

Stanford University,Neutrophil activating therapy for the treatment of Cancer,Docket #: S22-493,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/neutrophil-activating-therapy-treatment-cancer,"Despite their cytotoxic capacity, neutrophils are often co-opted by cancers to promote immunosuppression, tumor growth, and metastasis. Consequently, these cells have received little attention as potential cancer immunotherapeutic agents.\nHowever, Stanford researchers have demonstrated in mouse models that neutrophils can be harnessed to induce durable eradication of tumors and reduce metastasis through the combined actions of tumor necrosis factor, CD40 agonist, and tumor-binding antibody. The same combination activates human neutrophils in vitro, enabling their lysis of human tumor cells. Mechanistically, this therapy induces rapid mobilization and tumor infiltration of neutrophils along with complement activation in tumors. Complement component C5a activates neutrophils to produce leukotriene B4, which stimulates reactive oxygen species production via xanthine oxidase, resulting in oxidative damage and T cell-independent clearance of multiple tumor types. These results establish neutrophils as potent anti-tumor immune mediators and reveal a previously unappreciated inflammatory pathway that can be harnessed to drive neutrophil-mediated eradication of cancer.\nStage of Development\n\nApplications: Cancer immunotherapy.\n\nAdvantages: Novel molecular composition - the lab is unaware of any other cancer therapy based on the activation of tumor-killing neutrophils, The Neutrophil Activating Therapy (NAT), Cures a variety of solid tumor types in mice, Works in the absence of T lymphocytes, Activates tumor-specific T cells and induces tumor-specific T cell memory, Can potentially prevent metastatic cancer."

Stanford University,Improved screening of integrin drugs via cell culture model of integrin-mediated adhesion,Docket #: S22-065,Published Application: WO2023230461,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/improved-screening-integrin-drugs-cell-culture-model-integrin-mediated-adhesion,"Researchers at Stanford University have discovered a new type of integrin-mediated cell adhesion, called curved adhesion, that represents the dominant structure in 3D physiological environments. Further, they have developed cell-based models and a phenotypic assay for the development of integrin therapeutics.\nIntegrins proteins are the primary cell membrane receptors that mediate cell adhesion in mammals, anchoring the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrins, composed of an alpha and beta subunit with 24 known heterodimers, are essential for cell mechanotransduction, signaling, survival and migration. Dysregulation of integrin signaling contributes to the development of various diseases, making integrins key therapeutic targets in indications including thrombosis, autoimmune disorders, fibrotic diseases, microbial infections, and many types of cancer. While several integrin inhibitors are marketed drugs, therapeutic success has only been achieved for four integrin isoforms. Inhibitors targeting other integrin isoforms, particularly those in the alpha-v subfamily, which are indicated in cancers and fibrotic diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and nonalcoholic fatty liver syndrome (NASH), have faced significant challenges. In particular, inhibitors for alpha-v-containing integrins have demonstrated encouraging in vitro results, but have failed to show significant therapeutic benefits in clinical trials, despite their high safety profiles. The discrepancy between preclinical and clinical studies suggests that the preclinical models used in the drug discovery programs failed to accurately represent the in vivo physiology.\nThe inventors have discovered a new type of integrin function, called curved adhesion. To date, focal adhesions have been the most widely studied integrin-mediated cell adhesions likely due to their formation on ECM-coated flat surfaces, such as in 2D cell culture. Focal adhesions, which are driven by mechanical tension and require high substrate rigidity, were believed to be the dominant adhesion structure and were the primary target for integrin therapeutic development. However, ECM in tissues is largely composed of entangled protein fibers that are often too soft to support the assembly of focal adhesions. Curved adhesions, in contrast, are driven by membrane curvature instead of mechanical tension and can thus anchor cells to soft ECM fibers. Curved adhesions can co-exist with focal adhesions but are structurally and functionally distinct. In particular, curved adhesions are exclusively mediated by the alpha-v beta-5 integrin isoform, which is upregulated in many cancers and fibrotic diseases. The present studies indicate that curved adhesions dominate in 3D physiological environments. Therefore, targeting curved adhesions rather than focal adhesions offers a promising route towards the discovery of effective integrin drugs, particularly those for alpha-v-containing isoforms.\nThis technology presents a new platform to induce formation of curved adhesions in cell culture for the discovery of integrin therapeutics targeting curved adhesions. Additionally, it provides a proximity-based phenotypic assay for detecting curved adhesion inhibitors in high throughput screens.\nFigure 1. Schematic illustrations of focal adhesion and curved adhesion structures.

However, they suffer from very low energy density (1/10th that of Li-ion batteries) due to the weight and volume of the water in their anolytes and catholytes and are only practical for grid-storage.\nEngineers at the Chueh Lab have proposed a solution by creating a high-energy density catholyte or anolyte that can be incorporated into next-generation flow batteries for cost-effective energy storage. By leveraging the mixing behavior of different types of redox active molecules, a very high energy-density catholyte or anolyte can be made without the expense and added weight of incorporating solvents or long sidechains.\nHigher energy density flow batteries can expand applications beyond grid storage to powering ships, locomotives, and vehicles and storing wind and solar energy.\nFigure\nStage of Research\n\nApplications: Flow batteries for grid storage, solar and wind power storage, and electrical vehicles and other locomotive power., Fuel cells.\n\nAdvantages: Enables lower cost, high density flow batteries, 5-10X higher energy density as compared to conventional catholytes and anolytes, All components are redox-active without the use of a solvent, allowing higher density., Can create room temperature liquid catholytes or anolytes via eutectic behavior, i.e. the reduction in melting points via mixing, New applications - A flow battery with an energy density comparable to Li-ion batteries can unlock applications such as electric vehicles, accelerating the electrification of transportation and allowing greater adoption of flow batteries to store wind and solar energy."

This hydrogel can be held together three times longer than many alternatives without sacrificing its self-healing attributes during injection.\nHydrogels are used for a range of research and clinical applications due to their ability to mimic physical properties of human tissues. Common uses include vitro human development modeling, in-vivo drug delivery, and cell culturing. While a key feature of protein-engineered hydrogels is their ability to be tuned to desired stiffnesses, such tailoring contributes to rapid erosion rates, often degrading within a day. In this technology, static covalent bonds are leveraged to create """"spot welds"""" that drastically slow down its erosion without affecting the overall stiffness or inhibiting the shear-thinning behavior of gels. The use of these improvements have demonstrated that the resulting gels can be held together for 7+ days (compared to 2 days for hydrogels with other bonding molecules).\n\nApplications: Cell culture, Cellular therapeutics, In vitro models, In vivo drug delivery.\n\nAdvantages: Tunable mechanical properties, More robust – No shear-thinning, Longer lasting – 7+ days compared to 2 days for existing alternatives."

The resulting shapes are better suited for a user-defined objective, particularly for applications in charged-particle optics and trapped ion quantum computing hardware.\nOptimization of geometric shapes to improve the performance of electromagnetic devices is a challenging problem. While lens design optimization packages are widely used for the design of optical devices, similar tools are not available for electron devices. Current prototyping processes for electromagnetic devices often rely primarily on the intuition of the scientist or engineer. Available simulation packages commonly calculate the device performance based on an existing shape, but have limited optimization capabilities. Thus, users often must manually vary the device shape before determining device performance. However, manual efforts are inherently hindered by the vast number of parameters that can be varied and the computational burden, particularly for complex shapes.\nThe algorithm developed in this technology offers a more rigorous and scalable shape optimization by utilizing a differentiated Boundary Element Method (BEM) and mesh processing. Compared to other core physics algorithms, such as Finite Element Method (FEM) or Finite Difference Method (FDM), BEM produces more accurate gradients, enabling successful optimization. Further, mesh-based processing has few limitations to shapes that can be optimized, allowing the algorithm to be applied to a wide range of shapes and resulting electromagnetic devices.\nStage of Development Prototype\n\nApplications: Numerical simulation software packages for prototyping & optimization of electromagnetic devices, such as in charged-particle optics and trapped ion computing hardware, Physics designs where all or part of the underlying physics equations can be solved by a Boundary Element Method (BEM).\n\nAdvantages: Rigorous and scalable optimization capabilities, Fast execution speeds, Compatibility with GPU clusters."
Stanford University,Oligodendrocyte rejuvenation in the aging brain by Fgf17,Docket #: S21-153,Published Application: WO2023220639,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/oligodendrocyte-rejuvenation-aging-brain-fgf17,"Stanford scientists pioneer the use of Fibroblast growth factor 17 (Fgf17) to restore memory and treat associated age-related diseases and conditions by rejuvenating oligodendrocytes which are crucial for myelin repair in aging and other neurodegenerative diseases.\nAging, neurodegenerative, and demyelinating diseases have one thing in common: myelin degeneration. Our ability to form new oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for myelin formation, declines as we age, limiting the capacity to replace myelin loss. Therefore, oligodendrocyte rejuvenation in the elderly is a promising strategy for disease treatment.\nOligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) from which oligodendrocytes arise rely on growth factors supplied by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for their function. Age-related changes in the brain result in lower OPC support, resulting in inefficient myelin turnover and axonal damage. However, re-exposure of aged brains to young CSF induces OPC proliferation and maturation to oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus. Young CSF achieves this by inducing Serum Response Factor (SRF) signaling via the Fgf8 sub-family of Fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs), which consists of Fgf8/17/18.

Stanford University,Single Molecule Sequencing and Methylation Profiling of Cell-Free DNA,Docket #: S22-019,Published Application: WO2023235379,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/single-molecule-sequencing-and-methylation-profiling-cell-free-dna,"Stanford inventors have developed a novel cancer detection assay that relies on sequencing single DNA molecules.\nExisting methods of detecting cancer involve measuring the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patient blood. ctDNA measurement requires the addition of enzymes and other chemicals which cause oxidative damage to DNA and reduce the fidelity of sequences in the PCR amplification process. Stanford scientists have overcome these challenges by developing a DNA assay to detect and quantify ctDNA directly using single molecule sequencing. While next generation sequencing methods target methylated compounds, single molecule sequencing allows for direct detection and quantification of DNA originating from malignant cancer tumors. This assay offers a new framework of detection of cancer and other diseases without obtrusive pre-treatment of ctDNA.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept – in vitro data\n\nApplications: Cancer diagnostics, Other disease diagnostics.\n\nAdvantages: Simpler than conventional methods, Higher sensitivity to low-abundance reads, Eliminates need for enzyme and other chemical additions, Eliminates amplification bias that is common in conventional methods."
Stanford University,Direct Coupling of Biolayer Interferometry and Mass Spectrometry for Top-Down Protein Analysis,Docket #: S22-109,Published Application: 20230305019,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/direct-coupling-biolayer-interferometry-and-mass-spectrometry-top-down-protein-analysis,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed an affinity capture technique for top-down protein analysis that directly couples biolayer interferometry (BLI) with high resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS).\nTop-down mass spectrometry (TD-MS) is widely used to provide structural information, such as post-translational modifications and proteoform variation, on intact proteins. While a powerful method for characterizing intact protein structure, the quality of data acquired during TD-MS is highly dependent on the sample preparation. To prepare samples for MS analysis, protein analytes are typically purified from complex biological mixtures using an affinity (or immunoaffinity) capture technique on beads or resin. Yet, conventional affinity capture lacks real-time process monitoring, making optimization of sample preparation in case of weak or absent MS signal challenging. Alternatively, Biolayer Interferometry (BLI), a label-free optical sensing technology, is widely used to study the kinetics and affinity of real-time biomolecular interactions. BLI necessarily monitors the affinity capture of analytes in real-time, but cannot provide any structural information on the captured binding partners. Thus, the combination of BLI and TD-MS can provide both real-time monitoring of protein capture and structural identification. However, development of a seamless coupling method between these two technologies has been hindered by the small sample quantity that can be captured on the BLI microprobe tips.\nTo address this challenge, this technology directly couples BLI with HR-MS with a method called Microprobe-Capture In-Emitter Elution (MPIE). To implement MPIE, the analyte is first captured on the surface of a microprobe (Figure 1A), the microprobe is directly inserted into an electrospray emitter, and the analyte is eluted by spraying into a mass spectrometer for HR-MS analysis (Figure 1B). In comparison to conventional affinity capture techniques such as bead-based immunoprecipitation, MPIE introduces real-time process monitoring and provides binding characteristics of analytes, offering more information-rich experimental results.\nFigure 1. Microprobe-Capture In-Emitter Elution (MPIE) A) Schematic of BLI-based affinity capture on a microprobe B) Schematic of In-Emitter Elution for ESI-MS.\nImage credit to the inventors.\nStage of Development Prototype\n\nApplications: Top-down mass spectrometry, Antibody epitope mapping, Affinity selection of protein binders, Target quantitation.\n\nAdvantages: Efficient analyte transfer from the microprobe to the electrospray emitter enables high sensitivity MS analysis, Affinity capture conditions can be optimized efficiently, without requiring MS analysis, Estimated amount of captured analyte is acquired for every sample, providing improved quality control."
Stanford University,Cell-type specific enzymatic degradation of pathological mucins,Docket #: S21-461,Published Application: WO2023212733,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/cell-type-specific-enzymatic-degradation-pathological-mucins,"Targeted protein degradation is an emerging strategy for the elimination of classically undruggable proteins. Mucins are known to be involved in tumor-progressive pathways but are difficult to target using small molecules and antibodies. To overcome this issue, Nobel laureate Carolyn Bertozzi and her research team have engineered a cancer antigen-targeting mucin-specific protease (novel composition of matter) to degrade cell surface mucins on cancer cells and other cells in which aberrant mucin expression drives pathology. Fusion of the engineered mucinase variant to a cancer antigen-binding nanobody resulted in selective demucination of cancer cells,\nMucins have remained canonically undruggable. Therapeutic interventions face the challenge that mucin signaling occurs through the cooperative action of hundreds of arrayed epitopes and a unique, scaffolding secondary structure. There is no catalytic site to inhibit with a small molecule, nor is there a single binding site to block with an antibody. By bringing a protease directly to disease-driving mucins, we bypass these challenges via targeted protein degradation (TPD) of these unwanted molecules. This invention will further the development of biologics which degrade specific glycoforms of cell surface targets.\nThese enzyme conjugates can be a platform technology for a new class of cell type- and target-specific TPD therapeutics.\nStage of Development\n\nApplications: Cancer therapeutics, including common carcinomas such as breast, ovarian, and intestinal cancers which have mucinous forms wherein tumor cells present as individual colonies suspended in a matrix of secreted mucin., Other therapeutic applications include the range of human diseases which are characterized by aberrant mucin phenotypes, including but not limited to gut dysbiosis, cystic fibrosis, and bacterial endocarditis..\n\nAdvantages: Novel composition of matter, Addresses key challenge of undruggable mucins, Potential new platform technology - Extracellular proteins are nearly all glycosylated, and glycosylation status is commonly altered in disease.

However, the molecular composition of certain body fluids, like the eye's aqueous humor (AH), is poorly understood due to low volumes. Therefore, their full potential to inform us about body state cannot be harnessed. Using a proteomic approach, this gap can be filled as exemplified with AH below.\nStanford researchers collected a small volume of AH and applied it to a proteomic array to measure its biomarkers. Then, a custom bioinformatics analytical pipeline was used to define the molecular basis of known AH functions, including immune response, hemostasis, and proteolysis. Functional grouped network analysis revealed AH physiological roles including regulating angiogenesis, neuroinflammation, and metabolism. The inventors also identified potential biomarkers for aging, age-related pathologies, vitreoretinal diseases, and morbidity. This platform, therefore, significantly adds to a wealth of small-volume liquid biopsy technologies used to monitor health and disease.\nStage of Development\nProof of Concept\n\nApplications: Diagnosis of patients with eye disease., Determining patients' biological age., Determining the best therapeutic options for patients., Determining patient eligibility for human clinical trials., Studying drug efficacy and effectiveness in patients..\n\nAdvantages: There are no products like it out there.."

Predictions made can be used to identify suitable candidates for precision therapies targeted at the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing pathways.  Immunogenic dsRNAs are linked to inflammation in about 14% of autoimmune and inflammatory disease patients. Predicting disease risk using dsRNA burden identifies individuals suited for precision therapies targeting dsRNA-sensing pathways.\nStanford researchers have shown that increased dsRNA levels are strongly correlated with a higher risk for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Hence, they developed a system that uses genetic information to predict immunogenic dsRNA levels. The system collects genetic information and uses it to calculate an immunogenic dsRNA score (IDS). The system then compares the IDS score to IDS thresholds based on known IDS values for a given disease to generate predictions for disease risk. For a given individual and tissue/cell type, a predicted IDS higher than the corresponding IDS threshold indicates high risk.\nStage of Development: Prototype\nStanford researchers continue to optimize the model and use it to develop small molecule inhibitors.\n\nApplications: Autoimmune/Inflammatory Disease Screening including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, lupus, coronary artery disease, etc., Precision Medicine and Treatment Development - autoimmune disease patient stratification for targeted immunogenic dsRNA sensing pathways therapeutics..\n\nAdvantages: More precise and specific than conventional methods:, IDS prediction at the tissue/cell type level as opposed to  conventional polygenic risk score (PRS) methods., Identifies specific potential disease mechanisms for a given individual with high dsRNA burden, which is critical for precision treatment., The method is based on a very well-studied and specific immunogenic dsRNA sensing pathway.."

As power electronics shrink, they operate at higher frequencies.  Modern techniques to extend Hall effect sensor operations beyond current spinning (100KHz) are complex and require a variety of electronics to eliminate induced noise.  The XLab solution uses the Hall effect sensor with current spinning at low frequencies, then the Hall effect sensor with an inductive pickup at high frequencies.  The threshold frequency is based on geometry, sensitivity and current. A simple microcontroller tracks output, backs out the frequency of the magnetic field and magnetic field strength, and transitions from current spinning to passive mode with low energy consumption. (See Figure 1.) The lower cost and lower complexity XLab solution is ideal for turbines, motors, converters, inverters, and engine systems that operate at DC / low frequency to high frequency in the 10s of MHz and beyond.\nFigure 1 Wide frequency 2DEG Hall Effect Magnetic Sensor Solution\nFigure courtesy XLab\nStage of Development – Proof of Concept\nThe XLab has a benchtop proof of concept prototype that is being tested in a real-world motor with University of Arkansas, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), NASA and PC Krause and Associates (PCKA), as a Center for Power Optimization OF Electro-Thermal Systems (POETS) Industry Advisory Board (IAB) project.\n\nApplications: Measuring magnetic fields, Detection and control of displacement, speed, angle, and rotation speed, Turbines, motors, DC-DC converters, inverters, engines, etc., Diagnosing health of motor systems used in automotive, aerospace, etc..\n\nAdvantages: Ultra-wide frequency range (DC to GHz), Lower cost, Lower complexity with fewer circuits and no need for temperature compensation- dual systems with a coil + hall effect sensor suffer from temperature mismatch requiring electronics for temperature compensation and each system requiring individual circuitry., Passive mode lowers energy consumption."
Stanford University,Mouse genetic model for human Age-Related Hearing Loss,Docket #: S22-249,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/mouse-genetic-model-human-age-related-hearing-loss,"Stanford researchers have made a genetic mouse model to mimic the human LOXHD1 p.R1090Q mutation as a means to further investigate, understand and combat human Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL).\nThe gradual loss of hearing is a common manifestation of aging with both genetic and environmental contributing factors. Apart from the use of hearing aids or cochlear implants, which restore hearing partially, no treatment exists. LOXHD1 is a gene expressed in sensory hair cells of the inner ear and is required for mechanotransduction. In humans, the p.R1090Q mutation in the LOXHD1 gene is associated with the increased susceptibility to ARHL. To further understand the underlying mechanisms and potential treatments, inventors have used CRISPR/Cas9, sgRNA, NLS-Cas9 protein in FVB/NJ background to engineer a genetic mouse model with equivalent Loxhd1 p.R1064Q mutation.\nStage of Development\nIn vivo: mouse model created\n\nApplications: The mouse model can be used to:, evaluate the efficacy of drugs or treatment for ARHL, Better understand the biology of ARHL and noise-induced hearing loss.\n\nAdvantages: First mouse model to mimic human ARHL."
Stanford University,A method for the construction of aminocyclobutanes from copper-catalyzed aqueous [2+2] cycloadditions of unactivated olefins,Docket #: S22-298,Published Application: WO2024030363,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/method-construction-aminocyclobutanes-copper-catalyzed-aqueous-22-cycloadditions,"Researchers in the Burns group at Stanford designed a reaction methodology that allows for a green and inexpensive cycloaddition of amine or amide-containing unactivated olefins for the synthesis of biologically relevant cyclobutanes. Traditional [2+2] cycloadditions rely on electronically activated olefins to drive the reaction, which limits the scope of the products and requires additional chemistry to remove undesired activating functional group. Copper (I)-catalyzed photochemical cycloaddition can engage unactivated olefins but is air-sensitive and suffer from compatibility and reactivity problems.\nThe Burns group devised a new aqueous copper (II)- catalyzed reaction that allows for cycloadditions of olefins containing basic functional groups such as amines and amide, which are chemically important structures in many biologically active molecules. The reaction is environmentally friendly, water-tolerant, inexpensive and easily scalable, and can be done in any organic synthesis labs. This method is easily applicable to large-scale production of strained cyclobutanes scaffold in many pharmaceutical compounds, including but not limited to piperidine and pyrrolidine.\n\nApplications: Large-scale production of strained building blocks in pharmaceutical industries, Research tools for synthesis of novel cyclobutane-containing compounds.\n\nAdvantages: Environmentally friendly, scalable and user friendly, Reaction run in water, and utilize inexpensive copper (II) salts and low-intensity UV light irradiation, Tolerant of biologically relevant amide or amine-containing unactivated olefin, Readily incorporated into small molecule synthesis and pharmaceutical synthesis."

Various highly multiplexed imaging technologies available today can be used to visualize intra- and inter-cellular molecular features at the nano- and microscale. Although these technologies can determine cellular positioning in tissues, their ability to resolve subcellular elements is limited. Those that can overcome these spatial resolution problems are burdened by high water content limits, challenges in multiplexed imaging, difficulties in retaining protein epitopes for antibody-based imaging, and applications to archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. The Nolan lab developed the current invention to overcome the above limitations.\nThe current invention enables the interrogation of biomolecular organization in physically expanded hydrogel-embedded tissues and the subsequent complete removal of water molecules in the hydrogel while retaining the expanded lateral dimensions. High-content visualization of tissue organization across multiple scales can then be achieved using analytical methods, including mass spectrometry imaging (MSI).\nStage of Development\nProof of Concept\n\nApplications: Imaging assays for the detection of biomolecular neighborhood signatures in tissue samples at high-plex dimensions and sub 100nm resolutions..\n\nAdvantages: Fourfold or greater axial resolution improvements with the same instrumentation, Improved signal-to-noise ratio, Fast acquisition times, Effective single-cell resolutions for methods (including MALDI-MSI) that was previously unattainable."
Stanford University,Soft Tissue of Orbit Range of Motion (STORM) analysis,Docket #: S19-096,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/soft-tissue-orbit-range-motion-storm-analysis,"For orbital fractures, there are advanced solutions for the restoration of bony contour following trauma but the most debilitating functional consequences (pain and double vision) are due to soft tissue injury and entrapment rather than bony distortion.\nHowever, there are no quantitative means of assessing soft tissue entrapment pre-, intra-, and postoperatively in order to guide clinical decision making. Addressing this issue, Stanford researchers have developed a device and descriptive system for quantitative assessment of orbital soft tissue restriction called STORM. This medical device measures resistance of eye movement to locate soft tissue impingement and adhesions in surgical and diagnostic settings. In addition, to more precisely measuring restrictions, the resulting heat map identifies the location of the adhesion/entrapment.\nStage of Development\n\nApplications: Orbital fractures (especially complex repairs in conjunction with large and/or custom implants), Orbital reconstruction following skull base or sinus surgery, Thyroid eye disease, Congenital myopathy and fibrosis syndromes, 3rd nerve palsy and other large angle strabismus syndromes.\n\nAdvantages: Quantitative measurement of orbital soft tissue restriction to locate soft tissue impingement and adhesions in surgical and diagnostic settings, Generates heat map which identifies the location of the adhesion/entrapment, High clinical efficacy, Easily applied by all surgeons (majority of orbital fractures are also repaired by surgeons without ophthalmic training), Addresses gap in market space, The closest competitor that we are aware of is a functional first generation prototype developed by our team that contains a load cell within force-sensing forceps manipulated by the surgeon, with translation of the instrument measured by an inertia monitoring unit (IMU) that combines the capacity of an accelerometer and gyroscope, theoretically permitting proxy positional assessment by measurement of speed and linear acceleration about three axes. In a cadaveric fracture model, this permits accurate assessment of peak soft tissue resistance but does not work accurately enough to produce a reliable resistance-versus-excursion map.

Stanford University,"Cheap, rapid DNA/RNA diagnostics via amplified DNA nanoballs",Docket #: S21-436,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/cheap-rapid-dnarna-diagnostics-amplified-dna-nanoballs,"Researchers at Stanford, Yale, Rutgers, and the Karolinska Institute (Sweden) have developed a rapid and cheap method to detect genetic material from pathogenic infections (viral, bacterial, etc.) using electrical impedance measurement of amplified DNA nanoballs.\nWidely available diagnostic tests for infectious diseases are essential for managing public health. Optimal scalable diagnostic tests are fast, cheap, highly accurate, and can be completed at home. While polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are the gold standard for accuracy, they are slow, expensive, and must be performed in specialized laboratory facilities. Antigen-detection tests are lower in cost and portable, but often sacrifice accuracy. Tests for genetic material based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) have gained traction due to their lower cost and faster speed, but comparable accuracy to PCR tests. LAMP is a method of DNA detection that enables rapid amplification of a specific gene at constant temperature. Negating the need for variable temperatures, as is required for PCR tests, increases the scalability and application of LAMP tests to higher volumes and lower resource facilities. However, LAMP amplification has been typically paired with fluorescence based or colorimetric readouts, which requires costly detection instrumentation, making the application to ultra-cheap, disposable, and/or widespread at home tests challenging.\nThis technology uses a similar amplification strategy to LAMP, but instead of colorimetric detection, relies on an electrical impedance measurement as the detection output. This is achieved by adding a compaction component to DNA amplification which folds the amplified DNA into micron-sized nanoballs. The presence of these nanoballs can then be directly detected by changes in impedance when the nanoballs flow through a microfluidic channel. The ease of detection for electrical signals along with the high accuracy of DNA amplification enables the technology to be applied to cheap, fast, and portable devices for high accuracy diagnostic tests for infectious diseases.\nStage of Development: Prototype\n\nApplications: Infectious disease diagnostic testing, At home diagnostic tests.\n\nAdvantages: Reaction occurs at constant temperature (as opposed to PCR which requires thermocycling), Fast detection (~15-30 mins), Cheaper cost per sample compared to PCR, antigen, colorimetric LAMP, etc., High accuracy (comparable with PCR tests), Test compatible with saliva in addition to swab-based sample collection (compared to colorimetric tests in which saliva often interferes), Portable and compatible with at home use."
Stanford University,Animal model for human brain development and neuropsychiatric disorders,Docket #: S22-143,Published Application: WO2023239483,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/animal-model-human-brain-development-and-neuropsychiatric-disorders,"Researchers from Stanford University have developed an in vivo model of human neural development and disease.\nA key challenge in the study of human neurological diseases is the lack of animal models for the human brain and the scarcity of human brain tissue obtained for research. In recent years, organoids of human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells have provided an in vitro model to study brain development and disorders. While self-organized organoids can be generated that resemble different brain regions (such as human cortical organoids, (hCO)), the in vitro models lack the microenvironments or sensory inputs that are present in a living brain. Thus, in vitro organoids fail to provide an understanding of brain function, including neural circuits, behavioral outputs, and neuropsychiatric disease phenotypes.\nThis technology successfully integrates human organoids into intact, living brains of developing rats to create an in vivo model of human neural development and function (Figure 1). The transplantation is performed several days after birth when the rat brains still have developmental plasticity. Early introduction enables the transplanted organoid (t-hCO) to anatomically and functionally integrate into the rat brain, creating working hybrid neural circuits. The resulting mature t-hCO neurons are able to respond to external sensory stimuli and can drive behavioral responses. The ability to transplant a broad spectrum of hiPS cell derived organoids offers this platform broad application to the study and therapeutic testing for many human neuropsychiatric disorders.\nFigure Description: Transplantation of human cortical organoids into the developing rat cortex.

Stanford University,Acoustically modulated photonic metasurface,Docket #: S22-147,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/acoustically-modulated-photonic-metasurface,"Stanford researchers have developed an active photonic metasurface with fast and high-resolution optical control for light modulation devices.\nActive photonic metasurfaces define and shape a light field by providing dynamic control over optical phase, amplitude, and polarization. While these devices have promise in expanding optical control beyond what is possible in devices with traditional optics, they require the fabrication of electrically active optical components which are smaller than the wavelength of light, a current challenge.\nThis technology exploits surface acoustic waves (SAWs) to mechanically modulate insulating gaps between plasmonic nanoparticles and a metallic surface. By inducing small deformations in the insulating gap filler between the nanoparticles and the metallic surface, the optical scattering properties can be altered significantly. The use of acoustic waves enables force to be precisely sculpted across the surface with subwavelength (1 µm) spatial resolution and allows for control with GHz bandwidths. Taken together, the technology provides dynamic optical control for lightweight, compact, and high-efficiency light modulation devices. These advantages could be harnessed in a wide range of applications in communications, sensing, display and imaging, including light detection and ranging (LiDAR), holographic displays, flat optics, and strain sensors.\n\nApplications: Optical modulation such as beam steering, fluorescence lifetime modulation, coupled exciton resonance modulation, and quantum emitter modulation, Light detection and ranging (LiDAR), Dynamic holographic displays, Flat dynamic optics, Strain sensors and applications (e.g. Traction force microscopy).\n\nAdvantages: Remote placement of modulation electronics from the optical device – avoids challenges and/or reduced performance due to integrating electronic modulation components into the optical elements, Fast and precise modulation – compared to state-of-the-art optical control devices e.g. microoptoelectromechanical systems (optical MEMS), Switchable with GHz bandwidths."
Stanford University,Anomaly Detection in Complex Data Streams,Docket #: S22-217,Published Application: 20230409422,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/anomaly-detection-complex-data-streams,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a machine learning method for identifying anomalies in complex data streams. Anomalies, such as faults in assembly lines, defects in manufacturing processes, and equipment in need of maintenance, reduce the yield rate and increase the cost of manufacturing. Existing methods for detecting anomalies rely either on expert human knowledge or costly labeled datasets. The Stanford technology aims to discover these faults with high accuracy while requiring no labeling and minimal human intervention and labor. The new method is based on a novel training structure in which multiple machine learning models are trained simultaneously to maximize the outputs' covariance (or associated statistical metrics). By training multiple models—taking different data streams as inputs—to maximize the covariance of the network outputs, the models learn to cluster the input data and identify anomalous conditions.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept.

Stanford University,Minimally Invasive Neochord Devices for Mitral Valve Repair,Docket #: S20-202,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/minimally-invasive-neochord-devices-mitral-valve-repair,"Stanford researchers have developed two novel, minimally invasive neochordal devices for mitral valve repair. The first,  described in S19-432, is a high-impact, minimally invasive, percutaneous, transcatheter device that does not require open heart surgery nor cardiopulmonary bypass. It is administered percutaneously, entering the venous system, targeting the mitral valve through the atrial septum. This approach allows for direct positioning of a neochord spanning the mitral leaflet and left ventricular myocardium, a surgery known as posterior ventricular anchoring neochordal (PVAN) repair. This technology is far superior to existing transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair technologies because it aims at percutaneously implanting a neochord, as opposed to creating a double-orifice valve, as double orifice valves have been shown to increase harmful stenosis and forces on the valvular system. This technique replicates the gold standard, neochordal repair procedure, while edge-to-edge repair recapitulates an outdated technique that leads to worse outcomes. Moreover, the shorter neochord lengths due to the posterior ventricular targeting has been shown to reduce chordal forces on the valve, leading to a potentially more durable repair.\nThe second device is a neochord anchoring prosthetic for transapical off-pump mitral valve repair. The device is an elastic post inserted into the apex of the heart following neochord leaflet attachment. This device, functioning like an artificial papillary muscle, serves as an anchor for one or more neochordae. The elasticity and shortened neochord lengths mitigate the elevated chordal stresses associated with apical anchoring, aiming to reducing chordal forces and neochord pull out frequency and minimizing blood leakage.\nDr. Joseph Woo, renowned chairman and surgeon of Stanford Cardiothoracic Surgery, invented these devices and the PVAN procedure, which has been shown to provide tremendous repair results and patient outcomes. Moreover, recent studies have shown that shorter neochord lengths, accomplished with posterior left ventricular targeting and elastic transapical anchors, result in reduced forces on the neochordae and surrounding existing chordal architecture, translating to very low failure rates, reduced fatigue damage, greater repair durability, and outstanding patient outcomes. The inventions directly address some of the largest concerns regarding treatment of one of the most prevalent valvular diseases in the world, enabling a higher quality repair without the trauma of major surgery nor the rare expertise of surgeons from high volume treatment centers and leveraging advanced, minimally invasive technologies of the future.\nStage of Development:\nProof of Concept\n\nApplications: Percutaneous, transcatheter, neochordal mitral valve repair in a beating heart, Stand-alone medical device for implanting artificial chordae with any beating heart, Concomitant implanted medical device for improving transapical neochordal repair biomechanics and outcomes.\n\nAdvantages: -High quality repair technique: These devices are associated with a repair and not valve replacement, preserving the native structures and biomechanics as much as possible., -Reduced chordal strains: Shorter length neochordae result in reduced strain in the neochord and surrounding chordal architecture, translating to reduce fatigue and increased durability of the repair, -Low failure rates: Reduced strains directly result in reduced failure and increased durability., -PVAN is an entirely percutaneous and minimally invasive: Percutaneous approach facilitates a minimally invasive technique, which improves recovery times and reduces surgical complications., -Transcatheter delivery method: the invention leverages futuristic transcatheter approaches, which allows for wide adoption and clear avenues for robotic integration and manipulation.."
Stanford University,Targeted locoregional delivery of therapeutic extracellular vesicles with enhanced bioenergetic profile,Docket #: S21-374,Published Application: WO2023077160,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/targeted-locoregional-delivery-therapeutic-extracellular-vesicles-enhanced-bioenergetic,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a novel cell-free stem cell derived extracellular vesicle (EV) therapy powered by pulsed focused ultrasound (pFUS) that enhances its therapeutic and bioenergetic effect. The therapeutic effect of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) comes not from stem cell differentiation but from their release of EVs which contain therapeutic factors. The Stanford research group investigated the use of purified MSC derived EVs as a form of cell-free therapy. MSC-EVs are small enough to bypass the microvascular trapping in the lung, allowing them to reach targeted areas. The group optimized the therapeutic effects by using pFUS to stimulate MSCs which they have shown increases the bioenergetic potential of the cargo within the EVs. The group has demonstrated the therapeutic effect of this cell-free therapy in intro and in vivo in a mouse model of lung injury. This pFUS-MSC-EV is  system is cell-free, noninflammatory, stable and effective, and it has profound clinical translations for treatment of other pathologies.\nStage of Development:\nIn vivo mouse work\n\nApplications: Therapeutic treatment of chronic or acute respiratory distress syndrome and other related lung diseases, Therapeutic treatment of kidney injury, Treatment for other diseases with mitochondrial dysfunction such as pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nAdvantages: Cell-free, non self-replicating therapy, Easy storage and transportation while maintaining biologically active, Less susceptible to damage by hostile environment, Various modes of safe tissue delivery, Allogeneic transplantation."
Stanford University,An integrated preclinical screening platform to identify novel empathogenic drugs and compounds,Docket #: S21-419,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/integrated-preclinical-screening-platform-identify-novel-empathogenic-drugs-and,"Stanford scientists have developed a set of preclinical assays that are specifically designed to detect empathogenic effects of a drug that may indicate applications for that molecule in treating psychiatric diseases like PTSD.\nThe potential for the drug MDMA to be used as an adjunct to psychotherapy for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder has recently been uncovered and the therapeutic is in Phase III clinical trials. MDMA's therapeutic mechanism derives from its ability to foster feelings of empathy, and there is no other drug in clinical use that known to have this effect. While this breakthrough promises great potential in helping psychiatric patients, MDMA also has significant abuse potential, cardiotoxicity and potential neurotoxicity. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify novel compounds with empathogenic effects and a more favorable side effect profile. Existing drug screening platforms for such drugs primarily rely on in vitro screens of receptor affinity, and preclinical behavioral assays which are not specific for prosocial or empathogen-like effects.\nStanford scientists have developed a new screening methodology which involves both a novel set of behavioral assays that are specific for prosocial behaviors in mice, and a novel application of ex vivo brain imaging that detects patterns of brain circuit activation. The behavioral screening assays are a combination of the 3-chamber assay, social conditioned place preference assay, and the social transfer of pain assay.

AAV vectors are recognized as the gene transfer vectors of choice for therapeutic application because they have the best safety and efficacy profile for the delivery of genes in vivo. However, they require high levels of transduction to be used in pancreatic cells (including the insulin-producing cells associated with diabetes). Furthermore, the vectors need to target the diseased cells specifically and efficiently.\nTo address this problem, the inventors employed directed molecular evolution to generate and identify rAAV vectors with enhanced ability to transduce human islet cells. These AAV vectors with superior human pancreas transduction could require lower doses and fewer injections to achieve therapeutic relevance. They could be used for basic research into pancreatic cells function or in gene therapy to treat endocrine disorders, particularly type 1 or 2 diabetes.\nFigure description -  Graphical Abstract\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have performed directed evolution and identified several candidate variant AAV capsid polypeptides with relative transduction efficiencies 10 times more robust than previous gold standard (LK03).

The invention enables the use of gene-silencing approaches to prevent and treat viral infections.\nThe invented method leverages use of a micro-vesicle called ARMMS, which is produced by direct outward budding of the plasma membrane in cells that produce arrestin-like cellular protein, ARRDC1 (PNAS:109,4146). ARRDC1 localizes to the plasma membrane and recruits another protein (TSG101) to the site, which in turn causes the plasma membrane to bud outward and form a micro-vesicle. RNAs that are physically attached to ARRDC1, are transferred into the vesicle along with ARRDC1. Following ARMMS release, they can fuse with plasma membranes of other cells and discharge their cargo directly into the cytoplasm of those cells, evading degradation by extracellular enzymes, and hence overcoming a major challenge in delivering RNA therapeutics.\nA fruitful application of the technology is prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. The technology can be used to attack coronavirus replication protein RdRP (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), a major molecular target, at multiple evolutionarily-conserved sites---limiting drug resistance by virus mutation.\nStage of Development \nIn vitro data\n\nApplications: Delivery of any prodrug RNA: siRNA, RNAi, miRNA, stRNA, dsRNA, shRNA etc., Delivery to any cell type: viral, mammalian etc., Therapeutic for COVID-19, SARS, MERS, Cancer, Genetic Diseases, Metabolic Diseases.\n\nAdvantages: Delivery to any target cell: viral, mammalian etc., Intranasal method of delivery, Delivery of undegraded prodrug RNA by evading degradation via:, extracellular enzymes (proteases and nucleases) by ARMMS packaging, DICER by genetic alteration of ARMMS-producing cells to inactivate DICER genes, endocytosis mechanisms by direct cargo delivery to target cell cytoplasm, Limits drug resistance by virus mutation."

This is caused by chronic tumoral T cell activation which limits their ability to kill the cancer cells due to impaired proliferation, cytotoxicity, and effector functions. Therefore, identifying methods to improve T cell function and resist exhaustion via genetic engineering of T cells represents a highly promising therapeutic approach and major focus of the cell therapy field.\nStanford researchers have developed an in vitro T cell exhaustion model with genome-wide CRISPR screens for genes that improve these T cell functions.

Stanford University,"Highly selective Beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists for treating asthma, COPD and other bronchoconstrictive disorders",Docket #: S17-467,"Published Application: WO2019112913, Published Application: 20200360304, Issued: 11,590,089 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/highly-selective-beta-2-adrenergic-receptor-agonists-treating-asthma-copd-and-other,"Disease indication -Acute asthma, COPD, other bronchoconstrictive disorders (bronchial asthma, allergic asthma, intrinsic asthma, airway hyper-responsiveness, chronic bronchitis) with potential for treating heart failure. In particular, these molecules could be used in a rescue inhaler.\nDrug format - Small molecule (analogs of catecholamine type compounds such as isoprenaline, adrenaline and noradrenaline).\nDrug class - Improvement of existing class of bronchodilators.\nResearch stage and Preliminary data - The inventors have validated the compounds in vitro, demonstrating 100-fold selectivity for the  β2-AR over the β1-AR in a radioligand binding assay, and 1000-fold selectively for the β2-AR over the β1-AR in an arrestin recruitment assay.\nTarget - Beta-2 adrenergic receptor (β2-AR).\nBackground - The adrenergic family of receptors are the primary points of action for the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. The receptors are divided into two subfamilies (α and β) which differ in ligand specificity, expression in tissues, and downstream signaling.  In particular, activating β2-AR induces relaxation of airway smooth muscle. Thus, compounds that target β2-AR have been used as bronchodilators to treat various respiratory diseases including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). In contrast, β1-AR is highly expressed in the heart and activating this AR can lead to elevated blood pressure, exacerbate coronary artery disease and cause arrhythmias.  Therefore, if βAR drugs are not selective, they activate β1-AR along with β2-AR, causing severe and unwanted side effects in asthma or COPD therapy.\nMode of action - These compounds are analogs of adrenaline and noradrenaline which activate β2-AR with high selectivity over β1-AR. They are short-acting β2-AR agonists that can dilate airways in the lungs. In addition, the β2 selectivity, makes them potential candidates for treating heart failure.\nCompetitive edge - These compounds could greatly reduce the risk of cardiovascular side effects (e.g., arrhythmia, elevated blood pressure) compared to traditional bronchodilators that target the β2-AR. The molecules are 100 to 1000-fold selective for β2-AR over β1-AR whereas current therapies (e.g., salbutamol) are only 20-fold selective. In addition, the selective agonists are likely to be more effective than current therapies because they are full rather than partial agonists.\nPotential competitor - Current bronchodilator agents such as albuterol (Ventolin, Proventil etc.)."

Precious metal catalysts, such as platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd), are typically made in a form of small nanoparticles in order to create a large surface area for catalysis. However, these metal nanoparticles suffer from poor hydrothermal stability: under harsh conditions, the small nanoparticles grow into large crystallites with reduced surface area in a process called catalyst sintering and suffer loss of activity. Strategies to counter sintering often lead to activity-stability trade-offs.\nStanford researchers describe a new process to make a stable and active platinum-alumina catalyst that maintains high activity under harsh conditions. The metal nanoparticles are encapsulated inside porous alumina using nanocasting and maintain their small size (~3.8 nm) after hydrothermal aging at 800 ºC. This material has superior stability compared to conventional catalysts and is the first metal-alumina system that maintains high activity under harsh hydrothermal conditions (oxygen, steam). The researchers also extended the encapsulation technique to palladium-platinum alloys that demonstrate even better stability, maintaining stability and activity after hydrothermal aging at 1100 ºC. These materials would be useful in automotive applications like emission control technologies, given they represent the highest reported stability for supported noble metal catalysts.\nFigure (provided by inventors).

Since traditional simulation techniques (e.g., finite difference time domain, finite element method) take too long and are prohibitively expensive, metasurface designers typically use approximations - optimizing each meta-atom in isolation from the others.  To design metasurfaces with higher efficiencies, Stanford researchers developed software to quickly analyze the full metasurface. Using the transfer matrix method, a system of equations based on each meta-atom's input-output relationship is used to solve for electromagnetic fields capturing the interaction between meta-atoms (figure 1). The adjoint method optimizes the full metasurface.  GPU nodes accelerate solving the matrix, and decrease simulation time and cost (figure 2). Quick gradient-based optimization iterations significantly improve overall device performance (figure 3).

Stanford University,Negative Thermal Expansion for Glueless Sleave Joints,Docket #: S22-031,Published Application: 20230234325,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/negative-thermal-expansion-glueless-sleave-joints,"Researchers led by Stanford University's Stephen Tsai have developed new design and manufacturing approaches for glueless/boltless joining of metallic grid and carbon composite skins.\nTight fits are achieved by leveraging differing coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) between materials, particularly, the negative thermal expansion characteristics of [±60] carbon laminates relative to the axis of a cylinder. The shape-optimized metallic grid with carbon interior and/or exterior skin offers superior ease and speed of assembly by heating and/or chilling without bolts, welds, or adhesives.\nAssembly of the joint is facilitated by the negative thermal expansion of the carbon skin in the circumferential direction with temperature modulation. Joints with external sleeves can be assembled using pre-chilled components that seal tightly when raised to ambient/operating temperature. Alternatively, joints with internal plugs can be assembled using pre-heated components that seal tightly when dropped to ambient/operating temperature. For heavily loaded structural applications, prestress can be used for assembly with no need for adhesives and the accompanying difficulty of non-destructive inspection of adhesive bonding in composite structures.\nStainless steel is a good metallic grid choice for its toughness; fatigue and corrosion resistance; chemical compatibility with carbon composites; and ease in welding and metal removal by water jet. Its thermal expansion matches well with [±60] skin in both the circumferential and longitudinal directions of a cylinder.

Stanford University,Small molecule modulators for temporal control of gelation and hydrogel mechanics,Docket #: S22-134,Published Application: WO2023215881,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/small-molecule-modulators-temporal-control-gelation-and-hydrogel-mechanics,"Stanford researchers have designed a new 3-dimensional (3D) hydrogel cell culture system that models native tissue environment with precise control over gelation and degradation properties. Current 3D cell culture methods often use animal-derived proteins, which are xenogeneic and lack consistency across batches. In addition, enzymatic methods used to retrieve cells from the culture system can result in non-specific cleavage and downstream phenotypic effects.\nTo address the current challenges, the Stanford group designed a new, fully chemically defined hydrogel system. Using small molecule modulators, the gelation and degradation properties of the hydrogel can be finely tuned. In short, the system consists of: a polymer with chemically reactive functional groups, a small molecule competitor, and a small molecule catalyst. The competitor allows for adequate mixing of the hydrogel to achieve homogenous cell distribution and can be used to modulate the material properties of the hydrogel. Depending on the timing, addition of the competitor can also disrupt the hydrogel network, which allows for easy cell retrieval. Addition of the catalyst serves to alter the crosslinking bond exchange rate, which mimics the cell's ability to remodel its extracellular environment in native tissue. Together, this carefully designed hydrogel system can be used as a in vitro model to recapitulate native tissue for both research and clinical settings.\n\nApplications: Research tool for 3D cell culture platforms, In-vitro models for drug delivery or cancer research, Clinical tools for tissue engineering, regenerative medicine or personalized medicine.\n\nAdvantages: Homogenous and chemically defined hydrogel, Non-animal, xenogeny-free culture system, Cell-friendly retrieval method: elimination of non-specific protein cleavage caused by enzymatic degradation of traditional hydrogels, Recapitulation of the native tissue environment, Potential for both research and clinical translation."

Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) and the current standard of care is treatment with antibiotics. While an effective treatment for many cases, antibiotics don't work for 20% of patients with tick-borne illness and many suffer from lingering symptoms after treatment. Furthermore, with the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance, it is important to innovate therapies beyond antibiotics for the treatment against Lyme disease and similar bacterial infections. Researchers in Irv Weissman's lab have identified that Bb expresses a protein, p66, that mimics CD47 the mammalian """"don't eat me"""" signal implicated in immune evasion. Researchers propose that p66 is implicated in blocking macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of Bb and are developing a high affinity p66 inhibitor for the treatment of infected Lyme disease patients.\nStage of Development\nPre-Clinical\n\nApplications: Treatment of patients with Lyme Disease by p66 blockade using antibody targeting treatments.\n\nAdvantages: Alternative to antibiotic treatment."

Bustamante's lab have developed a phasing algorithm that incorporates sequencing read information, population and individual genotype data to provide more accurate haplotype reconstruction.  Humans carry two copies of every chromosome in their genome: one from each parent.    Determining which alleles were inherited together from one parent or the other (phasing) is a critical component of many downstream medical and population studies.  Methods have been developed to phase unrelated individuals in the absence of parental information but these methods restrict themselves to genotype, population, or read data alone when reconstructing haplotypes and obtaining better performance has become quite challenging.

Stanford University,LightHash: Photonic Blockchain Based on Optical Proof-of-Work,Docket #: S22-139,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/lighthash-photonic-blockchain-based-optical-proof-work,"Stanford inventors have developed a framework that performs digitally verifiable photonic matrix-vector multiplication in integrated photonic networks, which may potentially enable energy-efficient hash functions and cryptocurrency mining. Bitcoin is estimated to consume 113 TWh annually, which is approximately 0.5% of the world's energy. Proposed programmable photonic networks are capable of energy-efficient matrix multiplication operations but are limited by their error, as cryptographic applications require 'consensus' – where several devices agree on a given computation. LightHash decreases systematic error and enables photonic consensus by minimizing bit error rate, such that the matrix operation operates in a limited space of possible outcomes that can be reliably reproduced across many devices. The algorithm is a slight modification of Bitcoin's proof of work, where LightHash achieves at least the same security guarantee.\nFigure:\nStage of Development \nPrototype demonstrates that a photonic chip can implement a matrix-vector multiplication for a circuit size of 4.

Stanford University,HDAC4-mediated neuroprotection,Docket #: S22-219,Published Application: WO2024010709,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/hdac4-mediated-neuroprotection,"Stanford scientists have developed a neuroprotective, adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy vector that expresses a mutant form of HDAC4 or a fragment of HDAC4 with novel applications to retinal and neurologic diseases, including glaucoma and other retinal ganglion cell diseases.\nGlaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness globally, affects over 2.7 million individuals over 40 in the United States. Glaucoma comprises progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells. Degeneration of these nerves results in cupping, a characteristic appearance of the optic disc, and visual loss. Currently, glaucoma is treated by lowering intraocular pressure. However, this strategy is not always effective. Another possible way to treat glaucoma is by preventing neurodegeneration in glaucoma through neuroprotective HDAC4. HDAC4 is a Class II histone deacetylase (HDAC), a group of catalytic subunits of multiprotein complexes that alter chromatin structure and repress gene expression via binding to site-specific transcription factors. HDAC4 neuroprotection occurs in the nucleus and is mediated by preventing abortive cell cycle progression.\nThe current invention presents an AAV therapy that confers neuroprotection of retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma. The packaged vector is also useful for other retinal ganglion cell and central nervous system diseases and traumatic injury.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Treatment for glaucoma and other retinal ganglion cell diseases to be injected into the eye by ophthalmologists., Treatment of non-ocular CNS injuries, including following trauma to the spinal cord., Treatment of other neurological disorders, including stroke..\n\nAdvantages: A new AAV gene therapy vector that expresses a mutant form of HDAC4 or a fragment of HDAC4., Novel application of HDAC4 NT for the treatment of retinal and neurologic diseases.."
Stanford University,A tunable proximity assay that can overcome dilutional non-linearity,Docket #: S21-288,Published Application: WO2023154909,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/tunable-proximity-assay-can-overcome-dilutional-non-linearity,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a tunable proximity assay with a wide dynamic range that can detect multiple analytes in a single sample.\nBlood-based quantification of protein biomarkers is a standard tool for the prediction, diagnosis, and monitoring of disease. Physiological concentrations of different plasma proteins can vary considerably, spanning over 10 orders of magnitude. Current methods rely upon sample splitting and differential dilutions, which are vulnerable to issues arising from non-linear dilutions (NLD). NLD describes the phenomenon wherein measured concentrations of a given analyte deviate greatly from their expected values when measured at different dilutions. The effects of NLD can be dramatic, and there is currently no single assay that can quantify both low- and high-abundance proteins simultaneously from a single sample.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a tunable proximity assay, EVROS, that can overcome the problems arising from NLD. The EVROS method is based on paired oligonucleotide-tagged affinity reagent detection of target analytes; when two detection reagents simultaneously bind to the same target molecule, barcoded DNA strands can undergo a ligation reaction in the presence of a complementary """"hybridization splint"""" DNA strand. Ligated and barcoded nucleic acids can be further amplified and detected by high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Importantly, EVROS introduces two independent tuning strategies to modulate the signal response curve of each analyte individually. First, a probe loading strategy ensures that similar signals are produced for all targets, regardless of abundance. Second, an epitope depletion strategy (i.e., introduction of a pool of depletant antibodies) shifts the binding curve of the detection reagents to match the physiological concentration range of the target. These two tuning mechanisms can be applied to many types of immunoassays. The inventors demonstrate the power of EVROS over the Luminex approach in solid phase proximity ligation assay (spPLA) format to simultaneously quantify four different proteins with physiological concentrations ranging from low femtomolar to high nanomolar – a dynamic range spanning seven orders of magnitude in a single 5 µL sample of undiluted serum.\nStage of Development\nResearch – in vitro\n\nApplications: Multiplexed quantification of disparate analyte concentrations from small starting sample volumes (e.g., biomarker discovery, disease monitoring, blood testing in neonates or biobanked samples)..\n\nAdvantages: Tunable EVROS assay has a wide dynamic range, capable of determining the concentration of multiple analytes in a sample, even if the analytes are present at very different concentration levels, EVROS requires only 5 µL of sample, spPLA format includes polyclonal antibodies that are divided into pools for each target analyte (e.g. unlabeled depletant antibodies, detection antibodies, target capture antibodies), eliminating the need to screen multiple sets of monoclonal antibodies, Affinity reagents can be combination of antibodies, aptamers and nanobodies."
Stanford University,Method for massively-parallel screening of aptamer switches,Docket #: S21-289,Published Application: WO2023086335,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/method-massively-parallel-screening-aptamer-switches,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a massively parallel screening strategy to screen for target-responsive molecular switches.\nTarget-responsive RNA- and DNA-based molecular switches have potential utility in a variety of technological applications. Such biosensors are typically based on aptamers that undergo a reversible structure-switching mechanism that is coupled to a detectable readout. Unfortunately, it remains a challenge to generate novel aptamer switches, because most aptamers assume a stably folded structure and do not undergo a binding-induced conformation change. Most approaches to engineer aptamer switches rely on rational design and require prior knowledge of aptamer structure. Such detailed structural characterization has only been achieved for a relatively small number of aptamers. Furthermore, even the most advanced modeling software fails to account for non-canonical base-pairing or can correctly predict three-dimensional folding, which can be critical for target recognition and binding.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a system for rapid and massively parallel screening of different switch scaffolds in a single experiment, circumventing the need for rational design. Building upon their recently developed non-natural aptamer array (N2A2) system, the method enables the synthesis and screening of an array of fluorophore-labeled anchored displacement strand (ADS) switch constructs directly onto the flow-cell of a modified Illumina MiSeq instrument. Target-responsive molecular switches are identified by sequential imaging of flow-cell with and without the target molecule, and signal from library members can be linked to their nucleotide sequence by the location of the signal. Imaging data from each ADS construct cluster reveals the presence of switches for which target binding results in increase (signal-on) or decreased (signal-off) fluorescence. This method thereby identifies nucleic acid sequences that are able to act as target-responsive molecular switches. The inventors demonstrate the power of their method in identifying novel molecular switch sequences with a well-characterized ATP aptamer, including several sequences with non-canonical base-pairing. This approach bypasses the time-consuming process of structural analysis, rational design, and optimization by screening nearly every possible 10-nucleotide switch domain sequence in a single assay.\nStage of Development\nResearch – in vitro\n\nApplications: Massively parallel screening of target-responsive nucleic acid-based molecular switches, Screening strategy for converting aptamers to target-specific molecular switches.\n\nAdvantages: Method could greatly accelerate the development of target-responsive molecular switches from existing aptamers without any a priori structural knowledge, By covering the full range of available sequence space for the switch domain, screen can rapidly identify promising aptamer switch constructs that would be otherwise overlooked in rational design approaches, Screening methods validated with natural DNA-based aptamers and aptamers containing chemically modified bases, Methods do not need to start with a known aptamer sequence."
Stanford University,Ultrasonic Neuromodulation with High Spatial Resolution Chirp Waveform Pattern Interference Radiation Force (PIRF),Docket #: S22-076,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/ultrasonic-neuromodulation-high-spatial-resolution-chirp-waveform-pattern-interference,"Stanford researchers from the Khuri-Yakub group have designed an improved, high spatial resolution ultrasonic neuromodulation device that implements chip waveform instead of continuous wave PIRF. Ultrasound neuromodulation using one or two transducers have been designed previously, but high pressure needs to be applied to achieve stronger modulation, causing tissue damage due to cavitation. The Khuri-Yakub group designed PIRF, which maximize radiation force by situating two transducers oppose from one another to generate a standing wave that can stimulate neural tissues with far less energy. However, this method still has limited spatial resolution, and the position of the target or the transducer need to be moved mechanically to modulate a different area.\nThe group has therefore developed an improved PIRF system using a chirp waveform in which the frequency changes with time instead of a single waveform. Chirp excitation remarkably reduces the size of stimulation spot and allows for high spatial regulation. In addition, the modulation spot can be moved electronically rather than mechanically by correcting in proportion to time delays, which decrease the technical barriers associated with current neuromodulation methods. This new neuromodulation device can be readily implemented into current medical equipment as well as other fields where ultrasonic stimulation is required.\n\nApplications: Medical equipment for neuromodulation and nerve stimulation for various disorders such as Parkinson's, Tourette syndrome and epilepsy, Ultrasonic stimulation of other parts of the body where spatial resolution is required, Other fields where acoustic radiation force (ARF) is used (ex. particle manipulation, acoustic tweezers, etc), Implementation of PIRF with chirp waveform into general focused transducers.\n\nAdvantages: Greater radiation force with the same acoustic pressure, Reduced damage caused by heat and cavitation from pressure, Reduced stimulation spot size with chirp waveform, Improved spatial resolution with chirp waveform compared to the previous generation PIRF, Precise movement of modulation spot inside the body electrically, Easy implementation into existing transducers by changing the input signal to chirp waveform."
Stanford University,Algorithm to improve diagnostic accuracy of pulmonary hypertension using echocardiography,Docket #: S21-395,Published Application: 20230225696,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/algorithm-improve-diagnostic-accuracy-pulmonary-hypertension-using-echocardiography,"Stanford researchers have developed a next-generation computational algorithm for diagnostic of pulmonary hypertension (PH) that provides an estimate of the tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity (Vmax) with increased accuracy and confidence. Non-evasive diagnosis of PH often relies on estimation of pulmonary pressures obtained using Doppler echocardiography. However, interobserver variability of the estimated pulmonary pressures and lack of mathematical understanding of underlying TR waveform call for a more robust and reliable computational method to extrapolate TR signals.\nThe Stanford group designed a new computational algorithm that utilizes the cubic polynomial interpolation method as a physiological approach to TR waveform analysis. This method provides a much more reliable estimation of pulmonary pressure and Vmax, and it outperforms the current multivariable regression model especially in clinical settings with incomplete or variable signals. The new interpolation method provides quality control in clinical practice and can be incorporated into automated Doppler machines for improved PH diagnosis.\n\nApplications: Computational algorithm for current Doppler machines, Analytical tool for clinical diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, Analytical software for other medical devices involving extrapolation of signals.\n\nAdvantages: Robust computational method for clinical estimation of tricuspid regurgitation velocity, Effective extrapolation of TR signal for additional prognostic information, Easy implementation into the current Doppler machines and other technologies."
Stanford University,Transplantation of Airway Stem Cells to Treat Cystic Fibrosis and Other Lung Disorders,Docket #: S18-325,Published Application: WO2020132248,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/transplantation-airway-stem-cells-treat-cystic-fibrosis-and-other-lung-disorders,"Researchers at Stanford have demonstrated the first method of its kind for treating cystic fibrosis (CF) using regenerated airway stem cells embedded on a biocompatible scaffold. Their recently released study supports further development of this novel concept, i.e., using genetically corrected autologous airway stem cell transplant as a treatment for lung disorders. CF is a debilitating disease that results in early death and high morbidity. Improved therapies for CF and other lung disorders remain a tremendous unmet clinical need. Currently there are no stem cell-based regenerative medicine therapies for solid organs. This research advances a new concept of regenerating airway tissue via transplantation of genome edited sinus airway stem cells, as well as the concept of embedding those cells in a biocompatible membrane. There are no previous reports of transplanting gene corrected airway basal stem cells.\nStage of Development\nThe researchers used Cas9 and adeno-associated virus 6 to correct a mutation in readily accessible upper-airway basal stem cells (UABCs) obtained from CF patients. On average, they achieved 30%-50% allelic correction in UABCs and bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) from 10 CF patients and observed 20%-50% CFTR function relative to non-CF controls in differentiated epithelia. They also successfully embedded the corrected UABCs on a FDA-approved porcine small intestinal submucosal membrane (pSIS), and they retained differentiation capacity.\n\nApplications: Transplantation of airway cells into the airways to treat/prevent lung failure due to various causes, Transplantation of airway cells engineered to express other proteins/factors to treat other indications, Treatment of cystic fibrosis sinusitis and lower airway disease, Transplantation of gene corrected airway stem cells to treat cystic fibrosis.\n\nAdvantages: Novel and high potential, Addresses unmet clinical need."

Stanford University,Bimetallic Alloyed Plasmonic Photocatalysts for Efficient and Selective Heterogenous Hydrogenation,Docket #: S22-212,Published Application: 20230364597,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/bimetallic-alloyed-plasmonic-photocatalysts-efficient-and-selective-heterogenous,"Stanford researchers have designed a light-driven bimetallic alloyed plasmonic photocatalyst that can both effectively and selectively catalyze heterogenous hydrogenation. Metallic heterogenous catalysts produce more than 80% of chemical products, but the high activation barrier of the reaction often requires burning petroleum fuel, which leads to emission of greenhouse gases and formation of undesirable byproducts. The Dionne group at Stanford has developed a next-generation bimetallic catalyst consisting of a light-interaction plasmonic material (Ag, Au, etc.) as well as a catalytically active material (Pd/Pt). Optical excitation of the light-interactive material generates plasmons, collective oscillation of conductive electrons, which offers a chemical scaffold for a unique chemical reaction that may not be accessible by traditional catalysis. The researchers have carefully designed and balanced the system for optical properties and inherent activities to achieve both high yields and selectivity without greenhouse gas emissions. This new catalyst can be applied broadly to many hydrogenation reactions at current industrial chemical plants.\n\nApplications: Chemical catalyst used in heterogenous hydrogenation, E.g., Hydrogenation of acetylene into ethylene in plastic production, Environmentally-friendly production, CO2 Reduction, Green steel manufacturing, Plastic Upcycling.\n\nAdvantages: Energy-efficient, solar-driven catalysis process, Fine-toned chemistry for both high yields and selectivity, Free from greenhouse gas emissions, Broadly applicable to any heterogenous catalysis involving hydrogen-based chemistry."
Stanford University,Personalized Automatic Speech Recognition on Mobile Computing Devices,Docket #: S21-362,Published Application: WO2023159072,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/personalized-automatic-speech-recognition-mobile-computing-devices,"As artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms enable transformative new user experiences in mobile computing devices, data security and privacy has become increasingly important. In a typical deployment scenario, AI models are trained in the cloud with massive amounts of data and deployed to mobile devices """"as-is"""". While such an approach is generalizable to a majority of the population, certain user groups experience subpar performance (e.g. as a result of training bias introduced by imbalanced training datasets). Edge-based machine intelligence, where user personalization and incremental training is performed natively on the mobile device itself, offers a potential solution to these challenges. Such design goals impose challenging constraints on system-level performance and energy efficiency and necessitates hardware/software co-design at the system level.\nThe Wang lab at Stanford developed an adaptive automatic speech recognition (ASR) system for edge devices designed to address these challenges and pave a path towards enabling personalized ASR experiences for a multitude of users (e.g. privacy conscious users, non-native speakers, etc.). The technology employs a multi-faceted approach which leverages the triplet loss function and acoustic embeddings at the software level, and associative memories at the hardware level to rapidly identify words in constant time.

However, the phenomenon of """"on-target, off-tumor"""" toxicity is a barrier to clinical translation of many CAR T cells, including CD123 CAR T cells targeting AML. Combinatorial CAR T cells based on logic gating, including NOT-gated CAR T cells, can address this problem. NOT-gated CAR T cells have a tissue or antigen-specific inhibitory mechanism that limits CAR T cell killing of healthy tissues that may share expression of the main CAR target antigen while maintaining their ability to kill on-target tumor cells. Stanford researchers have developed inhibitory CARs (iCARs) based NOT-gated CAR T cells to circumvent CAR–mediated endothelial cell toxicity. This approach could allow CAR T therapy to safely target new antigens and new cancers.\n*Figure:\nStage of Development\nResearch – in vitro\n\nApplications: NOT-gated CARs to ameliorate on-target, off-tumor toxicity of CAR T cells.\n\nAdvantages: Reduced toxicity to healthy cells, increasing the safety of CAR T therapies, Maintains CAR T cell therapy efficacy against cancer cells, Increased breadth of tumor antigens that can be targeted by CAR T cells."
Stanford University,Hummingbird: Predicting Best Configurations for Genomics Cloud Computing,Docket #: S19-470,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/hummingbird-predicting-best-configurations-genomics-cloud-computing,"Stanford researchers developed a framework called 'Hummingbird' that predicts the cheapest, fastest and most efficient configurations to execute genomics pipelines on the cloud.  Genomics researchers frequently do not know which cloud configuration is best to execute a pipeline, and thereby select a more expensive cloud tier than needed.  Hummingbird provides three recommended pipeline configurations prior to running to assist the user in saving time and money:\nHummingbird formulates the configuration prediction via Downsampling, the Memory Profiler, and the Prediction Model.  Downsampling reduces the time required for the training phase prior to prediction. By reducing the size of the input files, Hummingbird can execute a genomics pipeline more quickly, thus decreasing the cost of training within the prediction framework. The Memory Profiler eliminates failures of the entire pipeline or any of its individual stages due to selection of inadequate main memory on the cloud. Once Downsampling is complete, Hummingbird uses the files to run the entire pipeline on different types of Google cloud instances. Once the execution is complete, the Hummingbird Prediction Model compares the execution time of all the instances and identifies the three different configurations: """"fastest"""", """"cheapest"""", and """"most efficient"""" (fast and cheap).\nHummingbird Cloud Genomics Pipeline Configuration Determination\n(image courtesy The Snyder Lab)\n\nApplications: Cloud genomics.\n\nAdvantages: Faster and lower cost – potentially an order of magnitude cost savings."

There is a huge interest in robotics research to effectively decompose complex language (plain English) into simpler skills. Following natural language instructions effectively is challenging, and current methods depend on directly passing natural language instructions to an agent. Stanford researchers have developed LISA, which passes a sequence of learned ciphers (skills) to the agent instead of natural language instructions. LISA (Learning Interpretable Skills Abstractions) is a hierarchical learning framework that can learn diverse, interpretable skill abstractions from language-conditioned demonstrations of behavior by end-to-end training of deep learning models. LISA enables users to use plain English to perform complex long-horizon tasks. This novel method outperforms prior methods to complete long-range instructions with double the effectiveness. Moreover, this learned language protocol makes the behavior of a robot very interpretable, which makes it highly desirable in settings like robotic surgery, autonomous vehicles, construction robots, and other safety-critical areas. Overall, LISA can enable artificial agents or robots to perform highly complex tasks in real-world environments like homes, offices, and hospitals.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Performance of tasks by robot in complex, real-world environments, household helper robots, factory robots, construction robots, robotic equipment in hospital/surgery settings, autonomous vehicles.\n\nAdvantages: Improved behavior of artificial agents (>2x effective), Requires fewer amounts of data, Shows good generalization to different language instructions."
Stanford University,Frequency-Selective Power Amplifier for Greener Fertilizer Production and More,Docket #: S22-108,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/frequency-selective-power-amplifier-greener-fertilizer-production-and-more,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a frequency-selective MHz power amplifier for generating dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. Commercial applications include plasma-assisted nitrogen fixation for fertilizer production. An alternative to the conventional Haber-Bosch process for generating ammonia, plasma-assisted nitrogen fixation using DBD is able to achieve much cleaner and decentralized fertilizer production at atmospheric pressure without generating greenhouse gases. The Stanford team's newly designed, frequency-selected Class E power amplifier is able to drive such DBD plasma loads at 10s of MHz frequencies. Due to the thermal limitations of the DBD electrodes, delivering power to one of the loads at an alternating manner allows better utilization of the power amplifier. Other advantages include greater efficiency and a more compact design compared to most commercial power amplifiers currently used in the plasma generation industry.\nStage of Development\nThe designed power amplifier is able to output 600 W at frequencies of 12.4 MHz and 15.5 MHz with a peak efficiency of 91.5%. Testing with the designed DBD electrodes demonstrates its ability to directly drive the plasma loads.\n\nApplications: Plasma-assisted nitrogen fixation for fertilizer production, Wireless power transfer, Biomedical (e.g., dielectrophoresis – widely applied towards the selective transport, separation and characterization of biosystems).\n\nAdvantages: More efficient and compact than most commercial power amplifiers used in the plasma generation industries, Supports smaller system size and more environmentally friendly fertilizer production than Haber-Bosch process, Plasma-assisted nitrogen fixation works under atmospheric conditions without emission of greenhouse gases, Localized production due to the reduced system size also eliminates potential cost and hazards during transportation, Allows efficient power delivery to the selected loads at multiple switching frequencies."
Stanford University,Bioprinting Platform for the Fabrication of Assembloids,Docket #: S22-095,Published Application: 20230357685,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/bioprinting-platform-fabrication-assembloids,"Stanford researchers developed a novel bioprinting platform for fabricating human assembloids with spatial control of organoid fusion.\nResearchers use model systems to study important spatiotemporally controlled cellular interactions which occur throughout human development and are otherwise inaccessible. While current in vivo systems have provided insights into numerous diseases, translating these findings into the clinic has underdelivered due to key developmental differences between conventional in vivo model systems and humans. On the other hand, in vitro model systems remain limited and do not recapitulate human development and disease satisfactorily. In an effort to better recreate aspects of development and disease in a dish, organoids, three-dimensional clusters of organ-specific cells with organ-appropriate physiologies, have recently been fused together to form assembloids. Assembloids have been shown to better emulate various tissues, including the brain, gastrointestinal tract, liver, pancreas, and retina. Unfortunately, although assembloids allow temporal control of organoid interactions, spatial control of their fusion is currently challenging, which limits their utility as a high throughput in vitro model.\nStanford inventors, therefore, developed a novel bioprinting platform for fabricating human assembloids with spatial control of organoid fusion. The platform consists of an iron-oxide particle-laden hydrogel and electromagnetic 3D printer to mediate the fusion of human stem cell-derived organoids or spheroids derived from any cell type or source.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Creating assembloid-based in vitro models to study normal tissue function and development, Creating assembloids-based in vitro models for various diseases including cirrhosis of the liver and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nAdvantages: The method allows the user to control the positioning of multiple spheroids or organoids in three dimensions with high spatial fidelity, The constitutive spheroid or organoid building blocks are not damaged or deformed throughout the printing process, The process itself can be automated and is highly reproducibility, The method, and associated device / materials, can be seamlessly replicated across any number of experiments, printers, or laboratories.."
Stanford University,Gelation of Uniform Interfacial Diffusant in Embedded 3D Printing,Docket #: S22-099,Published Application: 20230398803,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/gelation-uniform-interfacial-diffusant-embedded-3d-printing,"Stanford researchers developed a new technology that prints networks with distinct branch structures that emulate the natural branching observed in in vivo vascular networks.\nPerfusion must be achieved when forming three-dimensional (3D) multicellular structures for tissue engineering, 3D in vitro models of organ development and disease, or fundamental studies of cell behavior, among others. The need for perfusion is exemplified through the vasculature in the body and the need for vascular-like structures in large 3D cell structures. While the process of angiogenesis is currently understood, the technology needed to fabricate components of a functional vascular network like multi-scale, branched structures (e.g., bifurcations and trifurcations) and the increasing and decreasing diameters of vessels naturally found in vivo, is lacking. Similar fabrication challenges apply to multiple tissues throughout the body, including lymphatics, airways, and the gastrointestinal tract.\nStanford researchers successfully fabricated perfusable tissue structures using a new strategy called Gelation of Uniform Interfacial Diffusant in Embedded 3D Printing (GUIDE-3DP), which overcomes some of the challenges above. Embedded 3D printing involves the fabrication of desired structures within a support material, reducing deformation due to gravity and enabling the printing of complex structures.

However, many samples collected in clinical or food safety contexts can contain mixed prokaryotic and eukaryotic populations of genetic material, often with DNA from species of interest being far exceeded by other sources of DNA in the sample. This high background consumes vast amounts of wasted sequencing reads, increasing costs and decreasing coverage for the DNA of interest. Currently available enrichment techniques for prokaryotic DNA are expensive or time consuming.\nResearchers in the Fire lab have leveraged the distinct DNA methylation patterns between prokaryotes and eukaryotes to develop a simple, cost-effective, and fast method for enriching a subset of prokaryotic DNAs from mixed prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA populations for library construction and next-generation sequencing.

This approach will reveal unique biomarker profiles for wellness or diseases that are not currently identified. Measuring these biomarkers in hair helps to identify individuals at risk for poor health outcomes and to study various brain disorders.\nCurrently, there is no method available to monitor long-term human health. Multiple groups are developing and applying multiomic methodologies to serial blood samples. Yet, collecting blood samples is painful and invasive, and these samples can only provide data at a single time point.\nOur invention presents a better multiomic approach as it uses non-invasive sample collection, simplifies sample handing, allows sample processing (less than 3 hours) and storage at room temperature.

Common methods include titration, measuring off-gas pressure, electrical conductivity or calculating chemical equilibria, all of which require a secondary calculating to determine the concentration of dissolved CO2. Here researchers in the Dai lab have developed an infrared (IR) spectroscopy technique that allows them to overcome the typical challenge of CO2 peaks being overshadowed by water. This ~100 micron IR cell creates a thin film of solution where the water does not absorb all the light, allowing the CO2 signal to be resolved and quantified. This configuration tolerates high pressure systems (up to 58 atm) and still allows for clear CO2 quantification.

Ethylene (C2H4) is particularly attractive due to its major importance as a feedstock chemical for various applications.\nThe electrocatalyst is composed of copper-based material and a carbon-based catalyst which enables the formation of CO from CO2. The two materials are integrated into gas diffusion electrodes for direct conversion of vapor-fed CO2 into ethylene. The carbon-based catalyst converts CO2 to CO, and the copper surface converts CO to ethylene. The tandem electrocatalyst enables the high selectivity and formation rate of ethylene on a practical scale, achieving 40% faradaic efficiency (FE) at 150 mA cm-2 and 3.2 V in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer.

Stanford University,Risk Stratification in Newborns Based on Metabolites Using Deep Learning,Docket #: S20-528,Published Application: WO2022256850,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/risk-stratification-newborns-based-metabolites-using-deep-learning,"Prematurity is the single largest cause of death in children under 5 years of age, both in low-and high-income countries. The heterogenous nature of neonatal morbidities that account for poor long-term outcomes, and lack of predictive models, has prevented precision-medicine approaches that are needed for reducing the impact of this global challenge. Researchers at Stanford have developed a method for quantitative assessment of neonatal health using dried blood spot metabolite profiles and deep learning. Prematurity is associated with significant newborn health risks, including intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Current diagnosis and treatment of the latter three conditions are reactive to the occurrence and onset of typical symptoms. Moreover, current classification methods for preterm birth (gestational age and birthweight) can vary widely with regard to adverse health outcomes and thus of limited value for risk stratification. To create a more comprehensive approach, the Stanford team linked quantitative metabolite results from routine newborn screening (NBS) dried blood spots representing over 40,000 livebirths to clinical outcomes. Using deep learning, NBS metabolites were condensed into a metabolic health index predicting the likelihood of suffering from the four adverse neonatal outcomes described above. Their results show that premature newborns can be risk stratified on the basis of metabolic vulnerability through deep learning approaches. Further development of the metabolic and algorithmic definition of preterm risk has the potential to improve treatment decisions in the most vulnerable neonatal patients.\nStage of Development\nFuture work will focus on performance improvements and validation of algorithmic risk stratification using other available NBS metabolite values.\n\nApplications: Algorithmic assessment of neonatal health.\n\nAdvantages: Creating a biological basis for comprehensive newborn risk assessment should improve risk quantification and disease diagnosis, Enables early stratification to appropriate care pathways, An NBS-based metabolic taxonomy of prematurity has widespread translational potential as NBS metabolite values are collected as a part of routine neonatal screening in hospitals throughout North America."

The novel, interdigitated configuration developed at Stanford facilitates large-scale, mass production of such high-precision sensors with uniform sensitivity. This solution provides two main advantages: (1) misalignments between the fiber and the chip, which are inevitable during assembly, will have negligible impact on the optical sensitivity of the two-wave interferometer. (2) The design ensures that the sensitivity across many sensors will remain within a tight margin of the optimal sensitivity of the two-wave interferometer.\nStage of Development\nThe best performance of the sensors are 2 µPa/?Hz as microphones and 550 ng/?Hz as accelerometers.\n\nApplications: High-precision acoustic sensors, Underwater hydrophone arrays (underwater acoustic communication and surveillance), Accelerometers for strategic-grade inertial navigation units, Biomedical acoustic/ pressure sensors.\n\nAdvantages: Reproducible sensitivity at scale, Easy and quick assembly procedure, Ease of multiplexing into sensor arrays, High detection resolution."

Their solution addresses the need for a low-power optical coherent receiver to accommodate next-generation multi-wavelength data center links. The design offers an increase in per channel data rates to meet growing data center traffic demands. As data center systems are power- and cost-constrained, the receiver in question only uses analog components to reduce power consumption. Existing technologies for data center links are based on intensity modulation and direct detection. Using coherent detection, the proposed solution allows systems to scale to higher data rates per wavelength. Previous approaches have implemented independent analog coherent receivers for different wavelengths in a multi-wavelength system.

This technology may be extremely useful in experimental research, commercial polarization instrumentation, and industrial machinery. Today, polarization manipulation across multiple wavelengths is a critical task for many applications such as ellipsometry or pulsed laser systems. However, there is no method for dynamically tuning the polarization state of light across a large bandwidth. Current solutions experience various dispersion effects and largely operate in the linear polarization basis, limiting the operations that can be performed. In contrast, the Stanford technology provides arbitrary polarization axes, enabling full manipulation of the polarization space.

In order to have constant height of each beam, inserts in the beams between the joints will be required.  Finite lengths of unidirectional composite tapes must be engineered to staggered layup patterns to form strong cross-plied joints and inserts to maintain constant beam heights.  Further reduction in weight can be achieved if beams are made with sandwich core, and/or the skins of the beams are tapered as then approach their ends.  For tapered skin, the finite length tapes will have variable lengths.  This octogrid composite laminate structure will be lighter, stronger, and lower in cost compared to conventional laminate structures.

Unlike other T regulatory cells, they are not governed by FOXP3 master control and their transcriptional machinery is ill-defined, making it challenging to engineer or induce cells that exhibit their antigen-specific tolerogenic behavior.\nResearchers in the Roncarolo lab have discovered key transcription factors that govern the Tr1 cell phenotype via RNA-seq transcriptome analysis. They have proposed a method to utilize these factors to more readily induce Tr1 cell differentiation in vivo or in vitro from CD4+ T cells or iPSCs (induced pluripotent stem cells). While other methods have been described to produce these cells, they are difficult to execute, requiring the coordinated collection of donor CD4+ T cells and recipient monocytes and/or tedious clonal expansion from single cells.

While the previously developed AAV-LK03 is currently in use for human gene therapy clinical trials, this primate-specific serotype is limited in that it requires a surrogate serotype for preclinical rodent studies, adding time and cost to the drug development pipeline. There is little concordance comparing transduction between species when using recombinant AAV vectors, making it difficult to select vectors in the preclinical phase that will behave optimally in human clinical trials. To overcome this limitation, inventors in the Kay lab have engineered an improved AAV-LK03 by altering the capsid codon sequence to both maintain its transduction capacity in primates while also enabling use in rodents. In addition to the expanded capacity of this AAV variant, it also exhibits an increased efficiency in primate hepatocytes over the existing modality and functions in rodents both in vitro and in vivo.

However, those desired therapeutic phenotypes are usually regulated by multiple genes in the human body, and current technologies, which act on a single genetic pathway, cannot program such polygenic behaviors into cells. To get around this issue, we need to identify combinations of genetic and pharmacological interventions that achieve the desired polygenic therapeutic function. However, identifying the desired combination of genes and programming cells with these complex phenotypes at scale is intractable and requires a scalable platform for engineering cells with complex phenotypes.\nStanford researchers, therefore, developed a novel technology that provides a data-driven solution to the combinatorial scaling problem of polygenic phenotypes. The technology leverages recent advances in machine learning, modern genome editing, and high-throughput single-cell phenotyping to construct genetic perturbation libraries for which different phenotype combinations can be extracted from each cell.

Intraoperative CCS damage increases morbidity, treatment costs, decreases long-term survival, and often necessitates life-long use of mechanical pacemakers. Intraoperative CCS damage is partly due to an inability to visualize and, thus, avoid damaging the surrounding CCS. Despite this problem, there exists no intraoperative method for surgeons to detect the CCS apart from using anatomical landmarks to guess the approximate location of the CCS.\nStanford scientists, therefore, developed CCS optical imaging agents comprising two monoclonal Fab fragments generated by phage-display panning against human contactin-2 protein and are covalently conjugated to a benign, near-infrared (NIR) dye.

Despite being the most commonly inherited ataxia, there are no currently effective treatments for FRDA.\nAiming to address this unmet clinical need, this new therapeutic approach from the Xinnan Wang lab has demonstrated protection against oxidative stress, improved locomotor function, increased cellular respiration, and prolonged lifespan in animal models of FRDA.\n\nApplications: Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA), Oxidative stress related conditions.\n\nAdvantages: Novel therapeutic target and approach, No currently effective treatments for FRDA."
Stanford University,Photoreversible Acylation Reagents for Controlling RNA,Docket #: S17-479,"Published Application: 20190264205, Issued: 11,572,557 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/photoreversible-acylation-reagents-controlling-rna,"Researchers at Stanford have developed light-cleavable cloaking agents to control and study RNA activity in vitro and in vivo. Their simple, one-step postsynthetic technique for switching RNA structure and function ON/OFF utilizes novel acylating agents that can """"cloak"""" RNA by adding photoreversible blocking groups. The cloaked RNA cannot fold, hybridize or perform other biological functions.  Later, the RNA can be easily switched on (""""uncloaked"""") with short-wave light, reverting the RNA to its native, active form so that its function can be analyzed.  Unlike other photocaging technologies, these reagents and methods do not require any special synthesis or equipment. Another major advantage is this method can be used to cloak any RNA, regardless of length, enabling studies of long, biologically relevant molecules (mRNA, lncRNA etc.) that are difficult or impossible to synthesize via solid-state oligonucleotide synthesis. Use of the new approach on a transcribed 237 nt RNA aptamer has demonstrated the utility of this method to switch on RNA folding in a cellular context, and underlines the potential for application in biological studies.\nPhotocloaking agents and cloaking strategy. (A) Schematic of the photocloaking strategy; polyacylation of 2'-OH groups in an existing RNA blocks RNA structure and function, while photoexposure (365 nm) removes these blocking groups. (B) Structures of PCA reagents 1 and 2. (C) Gel electrophoretic analysis of untreated, cloaked, and uncloaked RNA.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors photocaged a transcribed a 237 nt Broccoli RNA aptamer and demonstrated the ability of this acylating agent to switch on RNA folding in a cellular context by exposing cells to light. In this experiment, cloaked RNA showed no measurable signal above background while subsequent light exposure restored aptamer function. This method showed ON/OFF behavior that was comparable or better than conventional photocaged phosphoramidites.\n\nApplications: RNA drug development - evaluating effects of therapeutic RNA candidates with precise temporal control of RNA function, Biology/biochemistry research:, study function of particular RNA molecules in cells (e.g, gene expression, catalysis and cell signaling), stabilize RNA for future experimental use.\n\nAdvantages: Convenient, simple techniques:, reagents and methods do not require any special synthesis or equipment, one-step photoprotection, postsynthetic labeling of RNAs that are difficult or impossible to synthesize via solid-state oligonucleotide synthesis, Large RNA molecules:, cloaking can be performed on any RNA, regardless of length (not limited to short, synthetic RNAs), ability to cloak messenger RNA and other, long, biologically relevant RNAs, demonstrated on photocaged RNA aptamer, Non-toxic - compatible with in vivo applications."

For example, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract has limited accessibility, such that collecting samples requires invasive medical procedures and specialized facilities. Non-invasive methods to sample biomarkers have been recently developed but are limited in their ability to isolate biomarkers within localized environments. The inventors have developed a prototype of a robotic pill that successfully entraps microparticles, proteins, and bacteria from the GI tract as model target collectables. The robotic pill comprises of a propulsion engine to enable locomotion and retention of the device at a localized environment over a desired duration. Additionally, the device contains a tunable storage module that can collect samples at different locations and times in separate chambers. Such samples may be processed after collection to enable time-resolved analysis of biomarker concentrations.\n Stage of Development \nThe inventors have developed a prototype to isolate biomarkers in the GI tract with high quantity and specificity, which can also be retained in specified locations.\n\nApplications: Disease diagnosis, Disease risk-stratification, Biometrics.\n\nAdvantages: Less invasive compared to current implantable devices, Provides direct information about biomarkers specific to a particular body cavity, High resolution sampling of biomarkers."
Stanford University,Vactosertib (small molecule inhibitor of the TGF-beta pathway) for the treatment of ventilator induced diaphragm dysfunction,Docket #: S21-337,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/vactosertib-small-molecule-inhibitor-tgf-beta-pathway-treatment-ventilator-induced,"Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a widely used treatment modality for the management of respiratory failure in intensive care units (ICU). An estimated 300,000 patients undergo MV annually in the U.S. In these patients, timely extubation promotes improved health outcomes and minimizes the risk of important complications such as pneumonia, delirium, gastrointestinal bleeding, and death. Progressive and dramatic diaphragm weakness and atrophy can result from MV, called ventilator induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD), beginning after as little as 2 days of MV. VIDD is characterized by the early reduction in the ability of the diaphragm to generate force in the absence of atrophy, and later development of frank diaphragm muscle fiber atrophy. It has also been established that VIDD is an important driver of failure to wean patients from MV.\nPrevention of VIDD is likely to reduce ICU stay, complications, and mortality in ventilated patients. The Shrager lab has demonstrated that components of the TGF-beta pathway, specifically Smad3, are critical to the development of VIDD in rats. Use of a Smad3 inhibitor prevented VIDD in rats in a published study.  The inventors hypothesized that administering Vactosertib to patients undergoing MV would disrupt diaphragm dysfunction and atrophy and thereby promote timely extubation. The novel treatment method would likely decrease ventilator days and resultant complications and deaths stemming from intubation and MV. It would have the potential to become a drug widely used in the management of ICU patients requiring MV. There are no medications currently approved for the treatment of diaphragm dysfunction or atrophy related to mechanical ventilation. While device-based approaches exist, these are cumbersome and invasive. The novel method of inhibiting Smad3 is simple enough to be used as a prophylactic.\n\nApplications: If approved by the FDA, this drug would ideally be given to intubated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) to reduce ventilator days and related complications.\n\nAdvantages: There is currently no approved drug for the treatment of diaphragm atrophy related to mechanical ventilation, Less invasive and less complex method compared to currently available methods (transvenous stimulation device)."
Stanford University,Acute and Chronic Pain Suppression through Targeted Peripheral Nerve Application of Focused Ultrasound,Docket #: S17-430,"Published Application: WO2022266261, Published Application: 20240115887",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/acute-and-chronic-pain-suppression-through-targeted-peripheral-nerve-application-focused,"Stanford researchers have developed method for targeted application focused ultrasound to peripheral nerves to suppress acute pain.\nThe prevalence of acute pain is high across multiple other healthcare settings, including inpatient wards, emergency departments, and postoperative units. Acute pain from any injury is frequently inadequately managed; yet, poorly controlled acute pain is associated with significant morbidity. Moderate-severe acute pain is associated with increased risk of developing myocardial ischemia, impaired pulmonary function, ileus, thromboembolism, impaired immune function, infection, and anxiety.\nIn the US, 100 million patients undergo inpatient and outpatient surgery each year. The vast majority of patients experience pain after surgery, and up to 75% of patients will have moderate-severe pain on the day of surgery. Of the 100 million emergency department (ED) visits in the U.S. each year, acute pain is also one of the most common complaints. Two out of three of ED patients with pain report it as moderate-severe, and yet, only half experience adequate pain relief. Among inpatient adults, up to 80% experience pain and 40% experience severe pain during their hospitalization. Extremity injuries (trauma and surgical) are common reasons for presentation to emergency department and for surgical intervention, and are associated with a high incidence of moderate-to-severe pain, prolonged opioid use, and chronic pain. Acute pain after surgery and trauma typically improves markedly within 2 weeks, but mild-moderate pain often persists for many weeks.\nCurrent acute pain treatment approaches generally fall into two broad categories:  of systemic pain medications (often opioids) and neuromodulating techniques, such as peripheral nerve blockade (PNB) with local anesthetics. Opioids remain among the most commonly used medications for acute pain management; in fact, 40-50% of all inpatients receive opioids during hospitalization. However, opioids are associated with a myriad of adverse outcomes, both short- and long-term. Short-term adverse effects of opioids include respiratory depression, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, and ileus, which worsen patient outcomes and increase patient care costs. Long-term negative effects of acute opioid administration include prolonged opioid use, high-risk opioid use, and the CP development. Further, chronic opioid use after traumatic injury, surgery, and hospitalization is frequent. Long-term opioid use is also associated with an increased risk of developing a large number of negative outcomes, including immunologic and hormonal dysfunction, neurocognitive deficits, hyperalgesia, suicide, and death. Additionally, opioids preferentially inhibit C-fibers over A-delta fibers and thus are better at controlling dull, burning, or rest pain, but not sharp or movement pain. Yet, despite not adequately managing pain, opioids are still widely utilized for acute pain therapy. In fact, more than 70% of surgical patients fill an opioid prescription after surgery, and more than 50% of trauma patients receive an opioid prescription upon discharge. While peripheral nerve blockade (PNB) decreases acute pain in many settings, peripheral nerve blocks have important limitations which have led to their under-utilization in trauma and surgical settings. While only inhibition of pain fibers (A-delta and C fibers) is needed, local anesthetics also block motor (A-alpha) fibers and non-pain sensory (A-beta) fibers, which may increase the risk of patient injury from falls and prevent early participation in physical therapy. Further, while the use of diagnostic ultrasound to find peripheral nerves is straightforward, PNBs can be technically difficult due to the challenges of perineural needle placement. Thus, anesthesiologists' PNB training is complex with expanding requirements for subspecialty training. Additionally, the time required for PNBs is often negatively perceived by surgeons and healthcare providers due to the risk of delays. Single-shot PNBs (single injection of local anesthetic) are short-lived (24 hours) and may result in rebound pain after cessation. Continuous PNBs (a percutaneous indwelling catheter is inserted with the tip next to a nerve for continuous or intermittent local anesthetic infusion) typically last 3-5 days, but require significant clinical follow-up for the provider/patient, and an increasing risk of catheter infection with a greater duration. Additionally, local anesthetic systemic toxicity, with a mortality rate of 10%, is a risk when local anesthetics are injected during PNB.\nPain after trauma and surgeries commonly is moderate-to-severe for 1-2 weeks after the injury and surgery. The vast majority of patients have poorly controlled acute pain during this period, which worsens patient outcomes.\nUltrasonography was developed in the 1940s to image tissue transcutaneously; diagnostic ultrasound energy delivery to imaged tissues is low. Ultrasound waves pass through human soft tissues with known attenuation factors for each tissue, enabling transcutaneous, (noninvasive) application to both superficial and deep tissues. Similarly to light waves, ultrasound waves can be focused to areas of varying size (relatively easily from 1mm to several mm in diameter) by using a concave transducer, delivering energy noninvasively to a target tissue, and having minimal impact on surrounding tissues. This focused ultrasound (FUS) can be used to deliver 4-6 orders of magnitude greater energy to tissues then is delivered by imaging ultrasound; depending on the FUS parameters used, the energy is transferred to tissue as thermal and mechanical energy. With magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guidance, high intensity FUS is used clinically as a noninvasive technique to safely ablate tissue, e.g., prostate cancer and uterine fibroids. Lower intensity FUS can be used for clinical purposes, non-permanently altering tissues.\nCurrently, FUS is widely investigated for its potential in modulating the central nervous system, specifically to treat diseases such as essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, neuropathic pain, and depression. Advantages of FUS for transcranial neuromodulation include the ability to noninvasively target deep brain regions, its ability to be directed at very specific and small areas of the brain, and its lack of ionizing radiation. There is increasing evidence that FUS may be an optimal tool for treating peripheral pain conditions. Prior investigations have also studied the effect of FUS on the peripheral nervous system (PNS), finding dose-dependent reversible or permanent reduction in peripheral nerve action potential (AP) amplitudes across different ex vivo and in vivo animal models. Investigators have postulated that FUS may be used to manage some pain conditions, and animal studies suggest further potential for this purpose. However, published investigations into FUS's utility for acute pain management are lacking from the scientific literature.\nInjected liposomal bupivacaine, for PNB and local infiltration at the surgical site, was developed to provide extended duration pain management. However, a recent meta-analysis concluded that liposomal bupivacaine does not significantly extend pain relief compared to non-liposomal bupivacaine. ATX-101, a phase II investigational sustained release local anesthetic-polymer, has also been proposed as an adjustable duration for local infiltration and peripheral nerve blockade. However, injection of local anesthetics is invasive and requires a high level of training to safely guide a needle to a peripheral nerve. Additionally, local anesthetics are direct neurotoxins, and exposure of peripheral nerves to local anesthetics beyond 48-72 hours results in increasing nerve injury (although without known clinically-relevant adverse effects).\nThe Anderson lab has investigated FUS's potential for acute pain suppression and found that using a distinct set of parameters, FUS 1) preferentially inhibits pain fibers over motor fibers and 2) blocks acute pain for 1-2 weeks after injury.\nFUS appears to be a promising modality for reversibly inhibiting peripheral nociceptive fibers without the need for systemic, addicting pharmacologic agents (i.e., opioids). FUS has the benefits of regional anesthesia and 1) is noninvasive, obviating the risk of infection; 2) eliminates the need for local anesthetics which inhibit motor fibers and have potential for systemic toxicity; 3) differentially inhibits nociceptive fibers over motor fibers, thus is unlikely to reduce PT participation or increase the risk of falls; 4) would require significantly less training and post-procedural care to utilize than regional anesthesia; 5) potentially could be employed as early in the chain of care as the battlefield triage station; and 6) may decrease the risk of developing chronic pain after trauma, and thus, reducing CP-associated morbidities (i.e. substance use disorder).\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Acute pain treatment using a distinct set of FUS parameters intermittently or in a pulsatile form.\n\nAdvantages: No other focused ultrasound device or procedure currently exists for peripheral nervous system neuromodulation to suppress acute pain., The current focused ultrasound method is a desirable alternative to opioid drug treatment for pain treatment., The device and procedure are noninvasive, The current device and method are a non-drug-based method for pain suppression.."
Stanford University,Transport-Mediated Photocatalysts for Selective Partial Oxidation of Alkanes,Docket #: S22-115,Published Application: WO2023177975,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/transport-mediated-photocatalysts-selective-partial-oxidation-alkanes,"Stanford researchers led by Dr. Arun Majumdar have developed photocatalysts combining transport- and reaction-selective nanostructures for direct methanol production. Acting synergistically, this architecture achieves high selectivity and conversion efficiency for partial oxidation of methane to form methanol and other oxygenates at room temperature. Direct conversion of methane to methanol and other partial oxidation products is one of the most scientifically challenging problems in chemistry that, if solved, has significant implications for the clean energy economy. With millions of tons of methane being wasted through venting and flaring, its conversion to valuable chemicals and liquid fuels and its ability to displace carbon-rich fuels such as coal, jet fuel, diesel and gasoline could substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, methane's high C-H bond strength, negligible electron affinity and low polarizability pose a high activation barrier. In addition, partially oxygenated products such as methanol and formaldehyde are more reactive than methane and thus are prone to over-oxidation to CO2. Consequently, direct methane to methanol conversion is often faced with a trade-off between CH4 conversion efficiency and methanol selectivity. New catalysts that can directly convert methane to methanol and other oxygenates under mild conditions with both high conversion and selectivity would greatly reduce the carbon footprint of the current industrial two-step methanol production process.\nStructure of the new photocatalysts for methane partial oxidation at room temperature. The researchers have shown that enclosing photocatalysts with transport selective structures is a generalizable strategy to achieve high selectivity and activity simultaneously in photochemical alkane oxidation reactions. (image credit: the inventors)\nStage of Development\nThe researchers have shown that oxygenates production exceeds state-of-the-art photocatalysts, despite experiments being performed at lower CH4 pressure.\n\nApplications: The photocatalysts can combine with different modular photoreactor configuration to produce liquid fuels and value-added chemicals including methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid with minimal CO2 production, directly from vented natural gas., Design can be generalized to other alkane oxidation (e.g., ethane oxidation; methane oxidation) using other oxidants such as H2O2..\n\nAdvantages: Successful partial oxidation of methane could lead to significant reductions in fugitive emissions while still retaining the value as a fuel or chemical feedstock., High conversion and selectivity, Mild conditions."

Common lung diseases, such as asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis are exacerbated by mucin hypersecretion and subsequent formation of airway mucin plaques. PEN-SP9 is a cell-penetrating peptide conjugated to a functional stapled peptide that blocks interactions between Syt2 and SNARE in airway epithelial cells to prevent rapid mucin secretion. Aerosolized delivery of PEN-SP9 enabled substantial peptide uptake in the distal airway epithelial cells and decreased airway mucus occlusion in mouse models, demonstrating that the therapeutic may be promising for treating acute and chronic mucin occlusion.\nStage of Development \nThe invention decreases rapid secretion of mucins without adverse side effects in mouse in vivo models.\n\nApplications: May prevent death caused by acute airflow obstruction, Could prevent mucus plaque formation in patients with chronic airway obstruction.\n\nAdvantages: Currently no therapies exist to treat airway dysfunction caused by rapid mucin secretion."
Stanford University,AgeIndex: A Whole-Genome Epigenetic Aging and Rejuvenation Index,Docket #: S21-450,Published Application: WO2023158680,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/ageindex-whole-genome-epigenetic-aging-and-rejuvenation-index,"Researchers at Stanford have developed AgeIndex, the first whole-genome epigenetic aging index and method based on Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) assays. AgeIndex provides an unbiased estimate of the biological age of any cell in the body (human or other mammal) by measuring the loss of its epigenetic information. As cells replicate, the transfer of epigenetic information to cells is not completely faithful, therefore, cellular replication accompanies a gradual loss of important information. Using a large dataset of WGBS data, the researchers demonstrated that the age-dependent loss of epigenetic information could be measured by comparing the cell with embryonic stem cells (defined as Age 0 cells). AgeIndex is capable of quantifying biological aging, at a cellular and chromosomal level, in different tissues, both in vitro and in vivo, and therefore able to assess the efficacy of new anti- aging and rejuvenation treatments. While several epigenetic aging 'clocks' have been developed recently they are not tuned for rejuvenation. A robust measure to accurately quantify aging as well as rejuvenation has yet to be commercialized.\nStage of Development\nThe researchers have tested AgeIndex in human and mice using 4 different sequencing and microarray assays (WGBS, RRBS, EPIC, and Methyl 450K assays). To their knowledge, this is the only aging index that successfully works with any tested assays. Optimization efforts are ongoing.\n\nApplications: Quantifying biological aging, e.g., consumer kits or research, Measuring efficacy of rejuvenation treatments, Ageindex can also be applied to free circulating DNA to provide a fast and reliable method to assess chronological and biological aging.\n\nAdvantages: Unlike competing methods, AgeIndex takes advantage of the whole genome and contains all the regulatory regions surrounding gene promoters."

While nonlinear multiphoton microscopy provides the resolution and depth information to produce 3D images of tissues at single-cell resolution, but it has a limited field of view, slow acquisition times, and must be performed in a controlled laboratory setting not compatible with many in vivo and functional imaging studies. On the other hand, one-photon fluorescence imaging can be used for in vivo imaging due to its portability and large field of view, but it produces a low resolution, low depth-of-field image only.\nThe invented device aligns one-photon imaging with multi-photon ex vivo images at the cellular level to obtain three-dimensional data at single-cell resolution during in vivo functional studies. The inventors demonstrate its utility in neuroscience applications by imaging functional neural ensembles in mice to determine neuron identity, the morphology of neurons, and fidelity of the time traces of genetically encoded calcium indicators expressed in these neurons. This technology will find use in functional neuroscience imaging such as this but also has applications in spatial biology, including spatial proteomics and transcriptomics.\nFigure (provided by inventors): Neuronal imaging in live mice with this technology\n\nApplications: Alignment of widefield functional in vivo imaging and three-dimensional, single-cell resolution ex vivo imaging with applications in:, Functional neuroscience studies, Tumor cell mapping, Multi-omics spatial imaging.\n\nAdvantages: Enables high-resolution 3D fluorescence imaging in settings where precise 3D microscopy is usually not possible (e.g., hospitals, live animals, patient's home), Combines advantages from both one-photon and two-photon imaging techniques, High-contrast, High-resolution, High signal-to-noise, Deep tissue penetration, Large field-of-view."
Stanford University,Methods and systems for treatment of renal colic due to the presence of ureteral calculi in the human urinary system,Docket #: S21-133,Published Application: WO2022212416,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/methods-and-systems-treatment-renal-colic-due-presence-ureteral-calculi-human-urinary,"Stanford scientists have developed a safe, minimally invasive catheter system that delivers acoustic energy to urethral stones and disintegrates them to treat renal colic.\nStones in the urinary system are painful and, in some cases, cause systemic infections. Additionally, renal stones can travel down the ureter towards the bladder and obstruct the path for urine. Renal obstruction can result in renal colic, ureteral stricture, and tissue damage. Renal stones are a common reason for hospital visits. Patients are often not treated immediately since doctors advise that they wait three to four weeks to allow the stone to pass naturally. During this time, patients rely on over-the-counter or opioid pain medication. If stones don't pass naturally or patients develop severe pain, infection, or hydronephrosis, they undergo relatively invasive procedures that cause ureteral trauma, requiring further medical procedures.\nStanford scientists developed the current technology to solve the drawbacks of the current gold standards of treatment. Their invention provides safe, minimally invasive, and effective catheter systems that utilize acoustic energy to dust renal stones without causing further trauma to the renal system.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Removal of kidney stones in renal colic patients..\n\nAdvantages: Minimally invasive intracorporeal approach, Can be used outside of the hospital, Does not require anesthesia, Efficiently removes kidney stones.

The main cause of cancer deaths is metastasis, which is the propensity of cancer cells to spread throughout the body. There is no existing treatment specifically tackling the issue of cancer metastasis.\nCD81 is a protein found on immune cells and cancer cells. CD81 inhibits cancer cell invasion and modulates host adaptive and innate immune responses against cancer, such as regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).\nStanford innovators therefore developed a unique anti-CD81 monoclonal antibody, dubbed 5A6, with specific biological properties compared to other anti-CD81 monoclonal antibodies. 5A6 stops the spreading of solid human tumors and B-cell lymphomas in xenograft models.\n5A6 works independently from the tumor histotype; its clinical development could therefore be envisioned across cancers.\nStage of Development\nPre-clinical\n\nApplications: Neo-adjuvant or adjuvant systemic therapy of localized solid tumors to prevent tumor metastasis, Systemic consolidation therapy after standard of care for metastatic cancers to prevent subsequent relapses, Systemic therapy of anti-CD20 refractory B-cell lymphomas., Loco-regional therapy of neoplastic lesions to avoid metastasis spreading (e.g intravesical therapy of urothelial carcinomas, topical therapy for skin metastasis of triple negative breast cancers,…).\n\nAdvantages: The 5A6 clone possesses unique biological properties not shared by other monoclonal antibodies targeting human CD81.."
Stanford University,Expansion of Human iPSC-derived Cardiomyocytes In Vitro Through Small Molecule Inhibition of Cell-Cell Contact,Docket #: S20-273,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/expansion-human-ipsc-derived-cardiomyocytes-vitro-through-small-molecule-inhibition-cell,"Stanford inventors have identified a treatment regimen that allows expansion of cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells in vitro. Human iPSC-derived cardioymyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are a tool used frequently in the study of cardiac biology and disease recently shown to have therapeutic potential. Cell-based therapeutic approaches using hiPSC-CMs, such as the injection of these cells or the transplantation of engineered cardiac tissue, show promise in repairing damage and improving cardiac function characteristic of many heart diseases. These approaches are limited because they require billions of CMs, a process that is technically challenging and incredibly resource intensive. To overcome this limitation, researchers in the Wu lab developed pharmacological interventions that block inhibition of proliferation consequent from cell-cell contact. Co-treatment with a small molecule mitogen combined with the pharmacological inhibition of cell-cell contact restores the regenerative capacity of hiPSC-CMs while maintaining the functional integrity of CMs. In addition to overcoming a technical barrier for therapeutic development, the ability to massively expand CMs in vitro enables researchers to address previously unanswered questions in regenerative biology, cardiac disease, and drug discovery using a highly pure and patient specific model.\nStage of Development\nResearch - in vitro\n\nApplications: Cell therapy for cardiomyopathy or congenital heart defects, Cardiac regeneration therapy or transplantation, In vitro disease modeling, High throughput drug toxicity and efficacy screening, Patient-specific engineered heart tissue, 3D tissue generation.\n\nAdvantages: Targeted expansion of CMs generates large numbers of pure CMs previously unobtainable in vitro, Bypasses need to start differentiation process with large amounts of iPSCs, CMs retain contractile, electrophysiological, and cellular characteristics, Robust protocol works across multiple cell lines with no observable differences from genetic background showing potential for patient-specific CM expansion, Can be expanded right away or following cryopreservation, Proliferating cells can be rapidly matured, Decreased labor and time."
Stanford University,NeRP: Implicit Neural Representation Learning with Prior Embedding for Sparsely Sampled Image Reconstruction and Other Inverse Problems,Docket #: S21-167,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/nerp-implicit-neural-representation-learning-prior-embedding-sparsely-sampled-image,"Stanford scientists have invented an implicit an Neural Representation learning methodology with Prior embedding (NeRP) to reconstruct a computational medical image from sparsely sampled measurements using only a prior image of the subject. Most deep-learning-based image reconstruction algorithms require large-scale training data and externally sampled subjects to be able to recreate a full image from sparsely sampled imaging data. The proposed NeRP framework exploits prior knowledge from a previous image of the same subject to serve as the initialization for the image search, allowing a multi-layer perceptron model trained on subsampled images (i.e., projection space sampling for CT or frequency space sampling for MRI) to reconstruct the full image, significantly speeding up data acquisition time. This technology would find use in a number of medical imaging use cases, including serial images of cancer patients over time, for which the inventors have demonstrated that the program can assess subtle changes in tumor progression over time.\n\nApplications: Accelerated image acquisition and simplified hardware design for:, Tomographic imaging (CT), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Other image modalities for which reconstruction can be formulated as an inverse problem.\n\nAdvantages: No large-scale data is required to train, Applicable to multiple different imaging modalities (MRI, CT, and more), Robust, reliable, and able to capture relatively small changes in images over time."
Stanford University,DesRhex-Corneal Descemetorhexis Surgical Device,Docket #: S21-059,"Issued: 12,029,686 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/desrhex-corneal-descemetorhexis-surgical-device,"Stanford researchers have developed a device to create consistently perfectly circular descemetorhexis at a predictable depth for use in surgery. Descemetorhexis is an important step in surgical procedures aimed at the replacement and/or removal of Descemet's membrane, often prior to transplantation of a donor cornea. Complications can arise from an imperfectly created descemetorhexis, like stromal scarring or even corneal perforation. These complications may lead to detachment at the graft edge, requiring regrafting in another procedure. Current methodology in descemetorhexis requires a freehand approach that is imprecise and dependent on surgeon skill. There is a lack of a device to aid in more precise, consistent descemetorhexis creation.\nStanford researchers have developed the DesRhex, a handheld surgical device that aids for positioning and scoring to create consistently shaped descemetorhexis. The DesRhex is made from both polymer and metallic elements, and contains two arms on the distal end, one for positioning/stabilization and the other for scoring/cutting the Decemet's membrane. The DesRhex enables successful descemetorhexis creation with minimal damage to neighboring anatomic structures and is technically easy for a surgeon to use. This device could be of specific use in a number of surgeries concerning the Descemet's membrane to improve surgical outcomes for corneal transplant procedures.\nStage of Development\nPrototype\n\nApplications: Aid in ophthamologist surgeries dealing with descemetorhexis:, Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) surgery, Descemet's stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK) surgery, Descemetorhexis without endothelial keratoplasty (DWEK) surgery, Descemet's stripping only (DSO) surgery.\n\nAdvantages: Creation of consistent centration shape and depth of descemetorhexis (opposed to current state-of-the-art freehand technique that lacks consistency)."

All three forms of crosstalk reduce spatial and/or spectral resolution, which lowers the commercial value of the camera.\nThis Stanford innovation addresses a newly identified form of optical crosstalk, unique to image sensors with patterned thin-film filters. The researcher discovered that cavity crosstalk occurs because the filters are made with highly reflective mirrors, which can trap and transport light to neighbouring pixels. The novel, low-cost hardware solution he developed eliminates this crosstalk by rearranging the patterned thin-film filters. The two main applications for this work are spectral imaging and miniature spectrometers.\nFigure:\nImage from Inventor\nStage of Development – Proof of Concept\n\nApplications: Spectral imaging –  improving sensor performance and enhancing adoption across domains (e.g., precision agriculture, quality control, medical imaging and diagnostics, etc.), Miniature spectrometers – which are currently being integrated in smartphones and other diagnostic devices..\n\nAdvantages: Low cost, easily implemented solution, Root cause resolution of crosstalk in patterned thin-film filters."

While AAV has been successfully used for gene delivery for many years, the receptor for this virus was only recently discovered (Pillay, 2016). The multi-serotype AAV receptor (AAVR) has been shown to be critical for transduction both in vitro and in vivo for most AAV serotypes including the major serotypes used in the clinic. Overexpression of AAVR has also been shown to increase transduction in vitro for multiple AAV serotypes that are known to poorly transduce cells.  This finding has allowed for the development of cells that can be used to functionally titrate AAV serotypes where it was previously difficult or impossible.\nCurrent problems\nApplications\nQuality control of AAV production for clinical serotypes by functional titration\nMouse model development for preclinical research for AAV-based gene therapy"
Stanford University,Method to Vascularize Biological Organoids,Docket #: S22-080,Published Application: WO2023164242,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/method-vascularize-biological-organoids,"Stanford inventors have developed a method to create spatially micropatterned vascularized structures that enable in vitro representation of human and animal biology in models such as cells, tissues, organs, and organoids. While tissue engineering techniques have yielded improvements to many in vitro systems, there remains a lack of robust vascularization in mammalian models that limits the usefulness of such models in many biomedical research contexts. Researchers in the Cardiovascular Institute have identified and optimized a regimen of growth factors and small molecules that can be applied to micropatterned human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), giving rise to a spatially organized and branched vascular network that is robust and scalable. To this end, the small molecules induce differentiation of micropatterned hPSCs first into the requisite germ layer(s), then into the desired progenitor cell types, finally into the terminal cell type(s). The tightly choreographed recipe has been demonstrated to create vascularized cardiac and hepatic organoids that recapitulate human development as determined by single cell sequencing, with current efforts aimed at creating vascularized neuronal organoids. This in vitro strategy offers an opportunity to build tools that better represent mammalian biology with significant implications for developmental biology, drug development, disease modeling, and regenerative medicine.\nStage of Development\nProof of Concept\n\nApplications: Developmental biology, Drug efficacy and toxicity testing, Disease modeling, Regenerative medicine: grow vascularized organoids/tissue to replace lost or damaged tissue.\n\nAdvantages: More robust and representative 2D and 3D vascularized tissues or organoids, Vasculature is created simultaneously with other tissue cell types, Spatially organized and reproduceable, Applicable to many organ, tissue, and cell types at different developmental stages, Allows the growth of larger organoids, Prevents death of cells inside the organoids that experience lack of oxygen, Micrometer resolution of branching structures and hierarchical organization recapitulates that of in vivo structures."
Stanford University,Negative Capacitance Tuning of Ultrasound Transducers,Docket #: S21-457,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/negative-capacitance-tuning-ultrasound-transducers,"Stanford researchers developed a programmable tuning circuit for dynamic, all-electronic tuning of the resonance frequency, sensitivity, and bandwidth of ultrasound transducers.\nTypically, ultrasonic sensing systems follow one of two design philosophies: using conventional transducers for general purpose use across broad application spaces, or fabricating custom transducers using novel materials, architectures, and transduction mechanisms that optimize for a specific application. The former approach suffers from sub-optimal performance, while the latter typically employs complex designs that require high fabrication time, effort, and cost. Moreover, with either of these approaches the operating frequency is fixed by geometric design decisions and scaling the system to incorporate large transducer arrays is particularly challenging due to inevitable process variations when using MEMS devices. Aside from the above challenges, all resonant transducers also have an inherent tradeoff between sensitivity and bandwidth, wherein one can either achieve high sensitivity or wide bandwidth but not both simultaneously.\nTo address these problems, Stanford researchers have developed a method that shifts complexity from custom transducer/MEMS fabrication to intelligent electronics instead, increasing system performance by overcoming the sensitivity-bandwidth limit and allowing for robust, reconfigurable, and cost-effective system scaling. This is accomplished through two all-electronic tuning circuits: 1) a tunable negative capacitance that can be utilized to shift the transducer to a desired resonance frequency while canceling any parasitic capacitance to maintain high sensitivity and combat process variations and 2) a tunable resistance that electronically dampens transducer resonance and increases bandwidth at the desired resonance frequency. Together, they provide an exclusively electronic means for tuning the transducer's resonance frequency, sensitivity, and bandwidth on the fly depending upon application requirements. Thus, with the proposed solution, one could use conventional, easy-to-fabricate transducers while employing the electronic tuning knobs to enable high-performance, yet highly reconfigurable ultrasonic sensing systems for a variety of applications ranging from medical ultrasound, non-destructive testing, and air-coupled sensing.\nFigure Description: Via the negative capacitance tuning technology described, the inventors are able to attain high sensitivity at all frequencies (source: inventors).\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Time-of-flight based applications like ultrasound localization, ranging, and distance estimation, Medical ultrasound, Non-destructive testing, Non-contact 1D, 2D and 3D ultrasound sensing and imaging in air, Cross-medium imaging\n\nAirborne sonar imaging (water-to-air)\nUnderground mapping (soil-to-air)\nMedical imaging (tissue-to-air), Airborne sonar imaging (water-to-air), Underground mapping (soil-to-air), Medical imaging (tissue-to-air).\n\nAdvantages: High sensitivity, wideband transducer response, Single device for high performance across frequencies (versus needing multiple devices), Simple fabrication with electronic compensation of any process variations to enable robust, low-noise MEMS-electronics integration."

The iRUM approach results in elastic and photo-patternable transistors that can retain charge carrier mobility even after stretching to 100% strain. The resulting stretchable material can also achieve high mobility retention after 1000 stretching-releasing cycles at 50% strain, and achieve stable 5000 cycle lives which is 5 times longer than previously reported methods. The inventors additionally fabricated a fully patterned, elastic transistor array by consequtively photo-patterning dielectrics and semiconductors to demonstrate multi-layer device fabrication.\nStage of Development \nThe inventors have fabricated a fully patterned elastic transistor, demonstrating the feasibility of integrated solution-processed electronics manufacturing\n\nApplications: Stretchable transistors, Flexible LED screens, Soft sensors, Flexible electronics.\n\nAdvantages: Rational designed materials enable desirable elasticity, solvent resistance, and patternability, Previous stretchable electronics have poor electrical or mechnical performance and have limited scalable production, Previous methods experience device failure or deformation under low strain due to crystalline morphology, Previous methods to pattern devices result in poor device uniformity and mechanical properties."

Additionally, these advanced materials are non-toxic and can be sputtered on to a surface at room temperature.\nMachine-learning guided, high-throughput experimentation (ML-HiTp) was used to discover these enhanced metallic glasses in the Fe-Nb-B ternary. This invention illustrates how this approach can improve on best-known materials and quickly lead to superior ones in highly complex composition-processing spaces.  This machine-learning guided procedure is not limited to just finding wear-resistant multiple principal element alloys (MPEAs), but can be readily applied to searching the vast processing-composition MPEA combinatorial for other desired materials.\nFigure\nImage Credit-inventors\nStage of Development\n\nApplications: Hard surface coating on commercial products including but not limited to cutting surfaces (e.g. knives to machine tools) and contact surfaces (e.g. electrical connectors and brushes in electrical motors), Can be applied to any hard product to reduce wear and tear.\n\nAdvantages: Inexpensive - made with low cost materials, FeNbB, Non-toxic, earth friendly materials, High wear resistance  – these new class of metallic alloys are 4x harder and nearly 2x more wear-resistant than stainless steel, Room temperature processable, Prolongs life of product  due to less degradation from wear and tear, Demonstrates how application of machine-learning-guided high throughput experimentation can improve on best-known materials and quickly lead to superior ones in highly complex composition-processing spaces."
Stanford University,Therapeutic Device Utilizing Electromagnetic Radiation with Oscillating Polarization State,Docket #: S22-075,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/therapeutic-device-utilizing-electromagnetic-radiation-oscillating-polarization-state,"Stanford researchers developed a device that emits electromagnetic radiation that oscillates between at least first and second distinct polarization states. Photobiomodulation (PBM) (also known as light therapy) has been used as a treatment modality for diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), insomnia, ADHD and dementia, and has been shown to be effective in improving patient recovery after surgical procedures. Many PBM devices utilize light sources that flicker at particular frequencies (that is, they oscillate between an on and off state at that frequency). For example, light sources that flicker at 40 Hz have shown particular promise in treating AD. A few PBM devices also utilize polarized light sources, and evidence exists that polarized light is superior to randomly polarized light sources in some applications (such as, for example, improved wound healing and accelerated recovery from protracted illness). This invention combines the benefits of a polarized light source with those of an oscillating light source. Moreover, since the device utilizes multiple polarization states, it can be used to address effects that are specific to each selected polarization state (e.g., due to stereospecific absorption). Moreover, because the device is in an """"always on"""" state (because oscillation occurs between two different polarization states, rather than between on and off states), the device may significantly shorten the duration of time-dependent treatments that are not polarization-specific. Finally, because the device is in an """"always on"""" state and oscillations in polarization states are not readily discernible to the human eye, the device overcomes the discomfort and deleterious effects sometimes associated with visible flicker.\nStage of Development \nProof of concept in in mouse models\n\nApplications: Light therapy for treatment of various diseases, such as Alzheimer's, insomnia, ADHD, dementia.\n\nAdvantages: Provides all of the benefits of conventional PBM devices and polarized light sources, Provides benefits unique to certain polarizations of light, Shortens treatment times, Overcomes issues with visible flicker."

By directly editing neuronal stem cells (NSCs), we can create a cell-based therapy that can deliver therapeutic proteins into the CNS in a precise fashion. This occurs by using cells that have the biologic property of turning into multiple CNS cell types and migrating to broad areas of the CNS.  The unique and transformative method can be used to treat a variety of both rare and common diseases.\nThe Porteus Lab at Stanford has developed a completely novel therapeutic method of delivering precise proteins to the CNS. Human NSCs are modified by delivering an engineered nuclease and a donor DNA fragment by electroporation to primary neuronal stem cells. After homologous recombination, the NSCs will have a transgene precisely and permanently inserted into a specific genomic location where it will be expressed in a sustained and regular fashion. The genetically modified NSCs can be purified and transplanted into the CNS where they will differentiate into different CNS lineages thus giving rise to cells in the CNS that express the transgene. Current enzyme replacement therapy does not deliver proteins to the CNS because of the bloodbrain barrier. This is the first invention using gene editing in primary human NSCs and can be used to create cells that can be administered to a patient to treat a disease.\n\nApplications: Treatments for the CNS and Neurological diseases, Drug delivery, Gene editing.\n\nAdvantages: Safely modified NSCs for transplantation, Stable long-term transgene expression not found using other mechanisms of genetic modification, First invention using gene editing in primary human NSCs."

Inventors at Stanford enhanced the efficacy of antimicrobial peptoids by using thiourea and thiourea derivatives. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antimicrobial peptoids against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Ciprofloxacin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae significantly decreased when determined in the presence of thiourea as compared to antimicrobial peptoid only. In addition, combination with thiourea enhances the efficacy of antimicrobial peptoids against bacterial biofilms. The combination of thiourea with antimicrobial peptoids has potential to be used in therapeutic applications to treat acute and chronic bacterial infections.\n\nApplications: Antibiotic medications, Antibacterial products.\n\nAdvantages: Enhances efficacy of treatment against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, Can be used with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, Does not synergize with the peptoid, preventing unwanted mutations to the compound."

There remains an unsolved problem in developing a therapeutic device to rapidly detect and treat local wound infection before it becomes clinically apparent. Prior research has shown that electrical stimulation can reduce bacterial colonization and restore normal wound healing in vivo. Stanford researchers have developed a novel closed-loop wireless smart bandage that can detect early infection and deliver precise electrical stimulation via a flexible circuit. Sensors embedded in the smart bandage detect early wound infection by measuring impedance and temperature. Soft and elastic hydrogel-based microelectrodes placed around the wound form a flexible circuit capable of real-time spatially localized electrical stimulation based on the sensor signals. Overall, this biocompatible soft system could be applied to initiating wireless wound healing in a closed-loop manner without imposing any mobility restrictions to the patient.\n\nApplications: Closed-loop smart bandage for closed-loop wound healing, Non-invasive wound monitoring.\n\nAdvantages: Wireless, non-bulky device for improved patient quality of life, Reversible adhesion to skin, Polymer-based hydrogel has lower impedance across frequency domain for more effective electrical sensing (compared to traditional ionically conducting hydrogels), Closed-loop control of wound healing compared to other interventions that require external monitoring (i.e., by a physician)."

As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic illustrates, during viral outbreaks there is an urgent need for diagnostic and prognostic tests to distinguish high-risk patients from those with mild infection who can recover at home. The researchers integrated 4,780 blood transcriptome profiles from patients infected with one of 16 viruses across 34 independent cohorts from 18 countries, and 289 scRNA-seq profiles of 702,970 immune cells across three independent cohorts. They identified four gene modules that distinguished non-severe from severe viral infection with clinically useful accuracy. Existing lab tests (e.g., white blood cell count differentials) and standardized severity of illness scores have limited clinical utility in a triage setting during viral outbreaks.\nThe researchers have previously described a conserved host response to respiratory viral infections, called the Meta-Virus Signature (MVS). They hypothesized that it could be used to better distinguish patients with mild versus severe infection, irrespective of the virus. Here it identifies distinct clusters of patients with non-severe and severe viral infection (image credit: the inventors)\nStage of Development\nThe researchers have identified a set of genes in human blood that accurately predict severe outcome in patients with viral infection, with analysis ongoing.\n\nApplications: Could be integrated in point-of-care test to provide answers in as little as 30 minutes, Useful during pandemic and non-pandemic times (e.g., influenza season).\n\nAdvantages: Biomarkers can be measured in peripheral blood, Early and accurate prediction, Generalizable across a broad spectrum of viruses and patient populations across the world, irrespective of patient age, Could help prevent healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed, Provides crucial insights into immune response dynamics during viral infection."
Stanford University,A Novel Device for Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation to Treat Renal Colic,Docket #: S21-369,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/novel-device-transcutaneous-electrical-nerve-stimulation-treat-renal-colic,"Stanford scientists have developed a non-invasive electrical stimulation device to treat pain in patients with renal colic.\nPain from kidney stones has been rated worse than childbirth or having a finger cut off. One in ten adults globally will suffer from kidney stones in their lifetime, and half of them will experience it twice. Current pain management with narcotics carries a risk of addiction, and other pain management options like ibuprofen are insufficient for pain of that magnitude.\nA team of scientists developed a novel transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation device that targets the appropriate nerves that signal renal colic pain to the brain.  When applied, the electrical stimulation device delivers electrical pulses through the skin to superficial nerves in the abdomen and near the hip to block pain signals from reaching the brain.

Stanford University,Treatment with a Protein Pharmaceutical Improves Functional Stroke Recovery,Docket #: S22-005,Published Application: WO2023154676,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/treatment-protein-pharmaceutical-improves-functional-stroke-recovery,"Stanford inventors have found that Stanniocalcin 2 (STC2) treatment following stoke leads to improved functional recovery and a pharmaceutical composition containing STC2 as an active ingredient can be used to facilitate post stroke recovery.  There are over 10 million strokes occurring annually, most of which leave patients with functional deficits. While acute treatment of strokes has improved, there are no approved drugs to facilitate functional recovery after stroke. Researchers in the George lab show that STC2 is an important factor that following stroke improves functional outcome in a rodent stroke model. STC2 is a secreted glycoprotein that is upregulated in a rodent model following treatment with neural progenitor cell transplantation and electrical stimulation after stroke, suggesting STC2 facilitates neurological recovery. Additional experiments illustrate a critical role of STC2 in endogenous stem cell production in addition to generally improved functional recovery. Functional recovery is measured using the vibrissae-forepaw model and the neurological severity scale, both of which are well-characterized endpoints indicative of behavioral function in stroke models. Treatment with STC2 offers an opportunity to pharmacologically improve the functional consequences of stroke.\nStage of Development\nIn vivo and in vitro data\n\nApplications: Treatment for functional deficits consequent of stroke, Treatment to improve stroke recovery.\n\nAdvantages: Pharmaceutical alternative to physical therapy, the only existing treatment for stroke recovery, No approved pharmaceutical treatments that improve recovery following stroke exist."
Stanford University,Use of immunosuppression to enable engraftment of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells,Docket #: S21-044,Published Application: WO2023133207,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/use-immunosuppression-enable-engraftment-allogeneic-hematopoietic-stem-cells,"In 2021, almost 200,000 patients were diagnosed with leukemia and other blood and immune diseases in the US. Stem cell transplants can be used to restore healthy bone marrow in patients with these diseases by stimulating new bone marrow growth and restoring the blood and immune system. A challenge faced by stem cell transplants is the successful engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells, which is necessary to sustain long-term and effective hematopoiesis. The Czechowicz Lab at Stanford has demonstrated that antibody-based immunosuppression can enable engraftment of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells. They have shown that this treatment alone is sufficient to enable engraftment of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells even in mismatched settings. Additionally, they have shown that in bone marrow failure syndromes (e.g Fanconi Anemia) this is sufficient for disease cure. Furthermore, the invention can be combined with CD117 mAb conditioning. Existing methods to enable stem cell engraftment require chemotherapy and/or irradiation, which are non-specific and cause significant toxicities in patients. The invention offers a safer alternative by using antibodies that offer immune and HSC-targeted conditioning to patients.\n\nApplications: Curative treatment option for multiple diseases – particular focus on bone marrow failure disorders (e.g. Fanconi Anemia), Hematopoietic stem-cell therapies.\n\nAdvantages: Does not require chemotherapy, irradiation and/or HSC-targeted conditioning."

Stanford University,Intraoperative Aortic Valve Visualization Test Device,Docket #: S20-192,"Published Application: WO2021255405, Published Application: 20230109069",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/intraoperative-aortic-valve-visualization-test-device,"Stanford researchers in the Woo Lab have developed a novel device that allows for direct visual assessment of the aortic valve apparatus under physiologic pressure in aortic valve procedures.  The funnel shaped device with a cantilevered edge on the proximal end fits a wide range of graft or aorta sizes without distortion and is secured to the distal end of a graft or the aorta without slippage or fluid leakage.  Two standard luer lock ports provide clear fluid injection (pressurization) and de-airing for a clear view. With continued clear fluid injection, the surgeon can clearly assess the aortic valve under physiologic pressure via the transparent top. Given the reversible attachment mechanism, this device enables surgeons to assess aortic morphology, cusp symmetry, and coaptation before and after aortic valve repair in an iterative process without the need to come off bypass (See video.)\nFig. 1\nCAD rendering of the device\nPost aortic valve repair, surgeons often test valve competency via saline injection test, which provides inadequate pressurization. Graft clamping test only provides subjective information and does not allow a direct view of the valve. Transesophageal echocardiogram evaluation remains the primary mode of intraoperative assessment of the aortic valve, but the results are highly operator dependent and also do not provide direct visualization of the aortic valve. If the repair is unsuccessful deemed by echocardiogram, the surgeon would have to re-cross clamp, re-arrest the heart, and re-repair the aortic valve, all of which can significantly increase intraoperative and postoperative risk, such as stroke and heart attack.\nThe Woo Lab device mimics the physiologic pressure that the aortic valve experiences in diastole, allows surgeons to visually inspect the valve before aortic closure and complete any additional repairs without re-arresting the heart, and thereby provides a safer and more effective outcome than current techniques.\nStage of Development\nResearchers in the Woo Lab at Stanford Medicine has completed a preliminary first in man testing, demonstrating safety and efficacy of the device.\n\nApplications: Cardiothoracic surgery - aortic valve testing.\n\nAdvantages: Safer and more effective than current techniques, Surgeon can directly inspect valve competency and repair success without an echocardiogram, potentially reducing surgery time and reducing the need to re-cross clamp and re-repair aortic valves., Provides physiologic pressure for aortic valve competency test without clamps, which block the surgeon's view to the aortic valves, Decreases intraoperative risk and risk of postoperative complications, such as stroke and heart attack.."
Stanford University,Game-Theoretic Planning for Autonomous Driving among Risk-Aware Human Drivers,Docket #: S21-368,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/game-theoretic-planning-autonomous-driving-among-risk-aware-human-drivers,"Stanford researchers in the Multi-Robot Systems Lab have developed a software model for predicting risk-aware human behavior in multi-agent traffic scenarios that include a range of human driver behavior from aggressive (speeding, overtaking, sudden zigzagging, and lane-changes) to conservative (driving slowly and conforming to the right-most lane).  Existing autonomous driving approaches plan conservatively and forgo game-theoretic reasoning.  In contrast, the human driver behavior model, CMetric, maps drivers' entropic risk preferences.  The game-theoretic risk-sensitive planner uses the risk preference to model risk-aware interactions among human drivers and an autonomous vehicle in various traffic scenarios.  (See Figure 1.)  This planner recognizes aggressive human drivers and yields to them while maintaining a greater distance from them.  The CMetric integrated planner systematically includes uncertainty, leads to safer navigation, and leverages the autonomous vehicles' influence on other cars to achieve safe and efficient driving.\nStage of Development – Computer Model\nResearchers have tested the method via an open-loop simulation.  Future work includes a more realistic closed-loop simulation that combines human behavior model and the risk-aware trajectory planner.  Research is ongoing.\n\nApplications: Autonomous vehicles.\n\nAdvantages: Safer navigation than existing methods, Risk-aware planner recognizes aggressive driving, and yields to them while maintained a greater following distance."

Both NAFLD and NASH are characterized by an increase in lipids stored in the liver and can lead to inflammation, scarring, and damage over time. While there is a growing prevalence of NAFLD that is fueled by increasing obesity rates, there are no FDA-approved pharmacological treatments. Researchers in the Svensson laboratory have shown that therapeutic treatment of ISM1 improves the clinical indicators of NAFLD, including liver weight, blood glucose, and lipid levels in the liver, in mice with established disease. ISM1 is a secreted bioactive peptide that regulates glucose uptake in skeletal and adipose tissue while suppressing lipid synthesis and inducing protein synthesis in the liver. Mechanistically, ISM1 is thought to inhibit cleavage and downstream activity of Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteic-1c, a known regulator of lipid synthesis. The ISM1 signaling pathway is distinct from other pharmaceuticals in development and directly targets the disease on a molecular level, offering a distinct and novel approach to treating and reversing NAFLD.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, Co-treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and diabetes.\n\nAdvantages: Utilizes novel therapeutic target with distinct mechanism of action that could circumvent adverse effects of other available treatments, Increases glucose uptake without side effects of fact accumulation in the liver and weight gain that often accompany insulin-based therapies, Improves insulin sensitivity."

Using a mouse model of abdominal adhesions, the researchers found that local application of T-5224 inhibits adhesion formation in vivo, with no negative side effects observed. Today, there are essentially no available treatments to prevent adhesions, which are fibrotic scars that form between abdominal organs following surgery or infection, and cause bowel obstruction, chronic pain, or infertility. Adhesions occur post-operatively in 50- 90% of all open abdominal operations, representing an enormous clinical problem impacting hundreds of millions of patients worldwide. T-5224 is a small molecule inhibitor of the Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex, and has previously been shown to decrease fibrosis in models of systemic sclerosis as well as to attenuate LPS-induced liver injury and endotoxin-induced kidney injury. The new findings suggest that T-5224 should be explored clinically as a novel agent for adhesion prevention; for example, in patients undergoing abdominal surgical operations.\nStage of Development\nResearch – in vivo.\n\nApplications: Prevention of abdominal adhesions in patients following surgical operations or intra-abdominal infection, In the treatment of other peritoneal diseases related to fibrosis (e.g., peritoneal carcinomatosis), Fibrosis elsewhere in the body (e.g., prevention of pleural or pericardial fibrosis in the context of surgical procedures in the chest or prevention of adhesions after tendon repairs).\n\nAdvantages: These findings represent a significant advancement in the prevention of abdominal adhesions, No comparable therapy currently exists, Potential for immense improvement in clinical care."

Record high amounts of energy can be stored (19.6 MJ/m3 or 17.9 J/g), six times higher than the best previously reported, while maintaining near 100% shape fixity and recovery. Shape memory polymers (SMPS) are promising materials in many emerging applications such as soft robotics, deployable hinges or space structures, sealants and smart biomedical sutures, due to their excellent shape recovery and other properties. However, practical application is limited by poor energy densities (1 MJ/m3). Achieving high energy density SMPs that simultaneously possess high recovery stress and large recoverable strain poses a significant challenge. The Stanford team's solution is a novel shape memory mechanism based on the formation of strain-induced supramolecular structures by polymer chains with dynamic bonds. Under strain, the polymer chains align into stable and hierarchically organized supramolecular nanostructures, trapping the stretched polymer chains in a highly elongated state. Upon heating, the dynamic bonds break and stretched chains contract to their initial disordered state.\nStage of Development\nFirst report of a shape memory polymer based on supramolecular nanostructures that achieves record-high energy density of 19.6 MJ/m3 with shape fixity and recovery above 90%. Optimization work is ongoing.\n\nApplications: Soft actuators, Soft robotics, Artificial muscle, Virtual reality motion generation, Responsive surfaces, Stretchable and wearable electronics.\n\nAdvantages: Simple one-pot synthesis at low cost ($5/kg for raw materials), Single-component and solution soluble, Excellent shape memory properties and high energy density, Competitive with existing technologies on key metrics (e.g., recovery stress, recovery strain, energy density)."
Stanford University,In situ forming gel constructs for ocular tissue regeneration,Docket #: S20-146,"Published Application: WO2021222612, Published Application: 20230263943",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/situ-forming-gel-constructs-ocular-tissue-regeneration,"Researchers at Stanford University have engineered chemically crosslinked in situ-forming gels that can mimic corneal stroma. Corneal injury, which affects millions worldwide, can be effectively treated by corneal transplantation but have limited effectivity and accessibility due to the global shortage of donor corneas, and the risk of surgical complication. The inventors have engineered hydrogels, biocompatible, naturally occurring polymers, for the sutureless replacement of damaged cornea tissue which aims to improve vision in patients. Compared to other biomaterials developed for tissue regeneration, these hydrogels are bio-orthogonally crosslinked, eliminating the need for photo-initiators or reactive side products that would otherwise limit their clinical use. The researchers demonstrate desirable biocompatibility, gelation times, and optical and morphological properties in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo. They show in corneal wound animal models that gel application enabled regeneration of corneal cells and decreased scarring, with complete restoration in corneal curvature.\nStage of Development \nThe inventors have demonstrated the utility of the biomaterial for cornea repair and regeneration in vivo using rabbits as an animal model, and are working towards characterizing its functional effects on vision.\n\nApplications: Regenerative medicine, Tissue engineering, Wound healing.\n\nAdvantages: More easily administered compared to transplantation, which requires meticulous dissection and suture placement, Addresses donor corneal supply issues for cornea transplantation, May decrease infection and rejection in patients who require transplants, Does not require initiators or catalysts which would limit their clinical use."

Binding of CRISPR protein to DNA generates ssDNA structures, which can be a sensitive biochemical signal of CRISPR occupancy. CasKAS uses recently developed KAS-seq assay for mapping ssDNA structures to identify DNA sequences that are associated with CRISPR proteins.\nCRISPR technology has great potential in biomedical research and medical practices, yet the off-target effects of CRISPR can bring risks to patients' health in clinical applications. There are numerous approaches to experimentally map off-target effects. However, some of these methods involve combination of complex molecular biology protocols that prevent them being widely adopted, while other approaches suffer from background and specificity issues.\nUnlike current methods, this new CasKAS method is fast and cheap. It only uses very simple molecular biology procedures, and it is highly accessible to labs with no high-level technological expertise. Moreover, CasKAS is applicable to all different types of DNA-targeting CRISPR proteins and it can be applied to primary non-dividing cells to profile both CRISPR occupancy and CRISPR cleavage.\nStage of development \nProof of concept\n\nApplications: CRISPR genome and epigenome editing, Personalized therapy.\n\nAdvantages: Quick and cheap, Simple procedures and more accessible, Applicable to all types of DNA-targeting CRISPR proteins, Applicable to primary non-dividing cells."
Stanford University,Enzymatic Detoxification of Aberrant NAD(P)H Tautomers for Improved Biosynthesis of Proteins and Biochemical Commodities,Docket #: S21-271,Published Application: WO2024215747,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/enzymatic-detoxification-aberrant-nadph-tautomers-improved-biosynthesis-proteins-and,"Stanford researchers in the Swartz lab have developed a method for improving the productivity of biosynthetic processes via enzymatic detoxification of aberrant forms of NAD(P)H.\nThe 1,6- and 1,2-NAD(P)H tautomers of the reducing equivalent carrier NAD(P)H are strong inhibitors of enzyme-catalyzed redox reactions that are critical for protein synthesis and other biosynthetic processes. Since the detoxification of these aberrant forms of NAD(P)H requires molecular oxygen as a substrate, they can accumulate in anaerobic industrial bioprocesses. Even in aerobic cell-free bioprocesses, the native oxidases present are often not sufficient to detoxify these byproducts, hampering overall productivity.\nIn this invention, scientists in the Swartz lab have developed methods to detoxify 1,6- and 1,2-NAD(P)H with enzymes (e.g., renalase or 1,6-NAD(P)H/1,2-NAD(P)H oxidases) that use molecular oxygen to convert these aberrant forms back into the original NAD(P)H. For the case of anaerobic bioprocesses, this invention also provides methods for establishing a secondary bioreactor for this aerobic reaction and for managing the input and removal of molecular oxygen as the biosynthetic mixture leaves and reenters between the main anaerobic reactor and a secondary aerobic bioreactor. When added to an existing industrial biosynthesis process, this technology can greatly improve the efficiency of the production of proteins and other biochemicals at scale by removing these inhibitory byproducts.\nRelated Technologies\nSwartz lab inventions S21-276 and S21-281 can be combined with this technology in a carbon-negative process for synthesizing biochemical commodities.\n\nApplications: Cell-free protein synthesis, Biofuel production, Biopharmaceutical production, Bioproduction of agricultural commodities.\n\nAdvantages: Improved productivity: Enzymatic conversion of aberrant NAD(P)H tautomers back to NAD(P)H improves efficiency of redox reactions in both aerobic and anaerobic biosynthetic reactors, Novel: No method or device yet exists for removal of these inhibitory forms of NAD(P)H."
Stanford University,Delivery and Enzymatic Conversion of Hydrogen Gas to Reducing Equivalents for Carbon-Negative Biosynthesis,Docket #: S21-276,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/delivery-and-enzymatic-conversion-hydrogen-gas-reducing-equivalents-carbon-negative,"Stanford inventors have developed a cell-free method for carbon-negative biosynthetic production of commodity biochemicals by using hydrogen gas as a source of reducing equivalents.\nThe incorporation of the carbon from carbon dioxide into biofuels and other biochemicals would help counteract global warming while also producing useful commodities. However, since carbon dioxide is highly oxidized, it requires a large quantity of reducing equivalents to be converted into the necessary precursors for production of biochemicals.  These reducing equivalents could in theory be supplied by hydrogen gas, but hydrogen gas is difficult to transfer into aqueous solution and to convert into a form that biosynthetic enzymes can use in redox reactions.\nIn this invention, scientists in the Swartz lab have developed a process that converts hydrogen gas into NAD(P)H reducing equivalents for biosynthetic reactions. First, a stream of bioreactor fluid is removed, pressurized, and then injected with pressurized hydrogen gas. When returned to the reactor, the supersaturated gas will come out of solution to form very small bubbles of pure hydrogen for good mass transfer. This hydrogen can then be used by a simple secondary enzymatic pathway in a cell-free reaction that generates the NAD(P)H required to reduce carbon dioxide into useful forms that capture carbon.\nRelated Technologies\nSwartz lab inventions S21-281 and S21-271 can be combined with this technology in a carbon-negative process for synthesizing biochemical commodities.\n\nApplications: Carbon-negative, cell-free production of biochemicals including biofuels, biopharmaceuticals, and agricultural commodity chemicals.\n\nAdvantages: Carbon-negative biosynthesis method helps mitigate global warming, Does not require expensive and electricity-intensive agitators to make use of hydrogen gas, Hydrogen injection process can be used in any reaction where hydrogen is a substrate to produce both organic and inorganic chemicals."
Stanford University,In situ cell-free synthesis of metabolic cofactors,Docket #: S21-281,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/situ-cell-free-synthesis-metabolic-cofactors,"Stanford researchers in the Swartz lab have proposed a method to synthesize metabolic cofactors from inexpensive substrates for protein synthesis and commodity production applications. Cell extracts can be activated to conduct metabolic processes, but the cell extract production lowers concentrations of metabolic cofactors, which decreases the rates of product formation. Purchasing cofactors adds significant expenses to the protein synthesis process which may block profitability. The inventors have addressed this concern via their synthesis method, which also enables control over synthesis extent to ensure that cofactors are provided to the metabolic reaction at optimal concentrations. Thus, this technology has the potential to increase rates of product formation at scalable costs.\nStage of Development \nConception without demonstration\nRelated Technologies\nSwartz lab inventions S21-276 and S21-271 can be combined with this technology in a carbon-negative process for synthesizing biochemical commodities.\n\nApplications: Biofuel, Agriculture, Commodities production, Polymer precursor production.\n\nAdvantages: Invention mitigates cofactor related expenses in commodity biochemical production, as it uses substrates present in cell extracts as inexpensive precursors."
Stanford University,Reducing Depression in Post Stroke Aphasic Patient: A Personalized Communication Device,Docket #: S21-286,Published Application: WO2023159206,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/reducing-depression-post-stroke-aphasic-patient-personalized-communication-device,"Dr. Maheen Mausoof Adamson and colleagues have developed a personalized non-verbal communication device and associated app for post-stroke expressive aphasia patients.\nAbout one third of the 750,000 people who experience strokes each year in the United States develop aphasia, a language disorder that impairs communication with others. Difficulty with communicating can also be incredibly demoralizing and it is estimated that over 50% of individuals suffering from post-stroke aphasia develop depression. Speech therapy, together with tools that allow for effective non-verbal communication, can help restore communication functions post-stroke. Unfortunately, current communication aide options are limited, lack means for direct involvement of speech pathologists, and ignore the mental and physical health state of the patient.\nThis new non-verbal communication device and associated app from Dr. Adamson and colleagues provides for a dynamic speech pathologist curriculum with continuously updated personalized stimuli. Additionally, the device can track and report key biometrics indicative of physical and mental health states so that communication partners, caregivers and speech pathogists can provide the most effective rehabilitation.\n\nApplications: Expressive Aphasia, Stroke, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Aging.\n\nAdvantages: Active monitoring of patient physical and mental health., Active monitoring of patient rehabilitation progress., Dynamically develops speech curriculum with the communication partner, caregiver, speech pathologist.."

However, the inability to predict which patients will respond to checkpoint inhibitors- only about 30% of the total treated- results in significant waste, causing unnecessary clinical and financial toxicity.\nResearchers at Stanford have developed a model called SpatialScore, which can predict outcomes from immunotherapy treatment in cancer patients. Using histological samples from patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), inventors in the Nolan lab have developed a technique to assess both the identity and spatial location of a variety of immune cell types, and developed a model of cellular 'neighborhoods' that are predictive of patient responses. In a 14-pateint cohort, the inventors have demonstrated that proximity of tumor cells to activating and suppressive immune cell populations are important predictors of patient outcomes.\nStanford researchers have validated their model in a cohort of patients with CTCL, and have further identified genetic signatures associated with responses to checkpoint inhibition.\n\nApplications: In vitro diagnostic/prognostic to predict patient responses to checkpoint inhibitors, Monitoring/theranostic method for immunotherapies to gauge responses during treatment.\n\nAdvantages: Minimized opportunity cost and reduced side effects from ineffective cancer treatments, Reduced cost to healthcare systems, Improved risk stratification for cancer patients, Provides additional clinical guidance beyond PD-(L)1 status."
Stanford University,Protease-Controlled Secretion and Display of Intercellular Signals,Docket #: S21-396,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/protease-controlled-secretion-and-display-intercellular-signals,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a generalized protease-responsive platform, called RELEASE, to control the secretion and display of proteins. RELEASE (Retained Endoplasmic Cleavable Secretion) is poised to enable local, programmable delivery of intercellular cues for a broad variety of fields such as neurobiology, cancer immunotherapy and cell transplantation. Across biomedicine, regulating the secretion and surface display of signaling proteins is crucial to program intercellular communication. Protein-based 'circuits' have advantages such as fast operation, compact delivery and robust performance compared to traditional synthetic circuits. However, these protein circuits have operated only inside the cell, and there remains an urgent need for a design that enables protein-level control of intercellular communication. To this end, the Stanford team created RELEASE, a modular design with engineered proteins retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and displayed/secreted in response to specific proteases. Their design allows functional regulation of multiple synthetic and natural proteins by synthetic protease circuits to realize diverse signal processing capabilities, including logic operation and threshold tuning. Linking RELEASE to additional sensing and processing circuits can achieve elevated protein secretion in response to """"undruggable"""" oncogene KRAS mutants.\nStage of Development\nAs reported in Nature Communications, the researchers have shown that RELEASE is compatible with circuit-level functions, controls biologically relevant proteins, responds to oncogenic inputs, and supports plug-and-play capabilities.\n\nApplications: Improving cell therapies, Cancer immunotherapy, Neurobiology research.\n\nAdvantages: RELEASE enables novel therapeutic modalities in cancer immunotherapy., Protease circuit components can be encoded within single mRNA transcripts that do not pose the risk of insertional mutagenesis., RELEASE is compatible with pre-existing protein-based synthetic circuits that directly integrate with the signal transduction pathways of the host.."
Stanford University,High Precision Tumor Resection Down to Few-Cell Level Guided by NIR-IIb Molecular Fluorescence Imaging,Docket #: S21-441,Published Application: WO2023141172,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/high-precision-tumor-resection-down-few-cell-level-guided-nir-iib-molecular-fluorescence,"Stanford inventors have developed a near infrared (NIR) tumor imaging platform that couples a novel rare earth cancer targeting agent and a handheld NIR-IIb fluorescence imager to enable tumor resection down to the few-cell level.\nSurgical removal of tumors remains a cornerstone of cancer treatment, but with visual inspection alone, incomplete removal of cancerous residues or excess removal of healthy tissue is still quite common. Surgeons have used near infrared imaging with fluorophores in the 800-900nm range to help visualize tumor margins, but there is significant light scattering and autofluorescence in that optical window that limits the tumor-to-normal-tissue signal ratios to ~1.1 to 7.\nThis invention is an imager and accompanying imaging agent that uses light in the 1500-1700nm range to improve the tumor-to-normal-tissue ratio ~100 times. An anti-CD105 conjugate that uses a novel rare earth down-conversion nanoparticle targets the tumor and labels it for NIR imaging, while a handheld imager that produces both a photographic and NIR image guides resection down to the few-cell level. The researchers have shown both the sensitivity and safety of this imaging platform, which has the potential to usher in a new paradigm of image-guided tumor resection.\nStage of Development\nPre-clinical\n\nApplications: Imaging platform for high-resolution tumor resection guidance during surgery, Platform for tumor imaging before surgery, Near infrared imaging agent for diverse applications in research and clinical imaging.\n\nAdvantages: Tumor-to-muscle ratios during surgery of ~300, 100 times higher than with organic dyes, Tumor-to-normal-tissue ratios of ~40 before surgery, as compared to ~1.1 to 7 for previous technologies, Imaging in a NIR-IIb near infrared spectrum (1500-1700nm) shows lower background than with the current NIR imaging agents that operate in the 800-900nm range."
Stanford University,CRISPR-based FOXP3 gene Engineered T cells and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Precursors to treat IPEX syndrome patients,Docket #: S21-023,"Published Application: WO2021163642, Published Application: 20230081343",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/crispr-based-foxp3-gene-engineered-t-cells-and-hematopoietic-stem-cell-precursors-treat,"IPEX syndrome is a severe autoimmune disease with limited treatment options caused by mutations in the forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) gene, which plays a critical role in immune regulation. As a monogenic immune disease, IPEX is an ideal candidate for a gene therapy approach whereby patient hematopoietic stem and progenitor (HSPC) cells or T cells are gene corrected ex vivo and reinfused in the patient. The Bacchetta, Roncarolo, and Porteus Labs at Stanford developed a CRISPR-based FOXP3 gene correction approach that uses homology directed repair to insert a FOXP3 cDNA into the endogenous gene locus and permit regulated expression of wild-type FOXP3 protein irrespective of downstream mutations. This site-specific approach is designed to benefit a broad range of IPEX patients, given that the causative mutations are located downstream of the insertion site. The technique permits gene delivery to patient-derived HSPCs for an autologous transplant or to T cells for autologous cell therapy. The method uniquely restores physiological expression of FOXP3 and repairs the function of multiple cell lineages disrupted by the FOXP3 mutations that is responsible for disease manifestations. This novel approach is thus suitable for developing therapies for IPEX patients with diverse FOXP3 mutations.\n\nApplications: IPEX syndrome therapies, Autoimmune disease, Cell therapies, CRISPR-based therapies.\n\nAdvantages: Compatible with all patients and is site-specific, Restores multiple lineages and targets multiple mutations."

Therefore, it is critical for physicians to correctly identify metastases as early as  possible. The lymph nodes are some of first organs that many metastasizing cancer cells commonly spread through. The lymph node which cancer cells are most likely to spread to can thus serve as 'sentinels' to idenify the early metastases of cancers through biopsy. In order perform these sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNBs), the lymph nodes are first identified through imaging of injected radioactive or fluorescent dyes. However, currently available methods suffer from uncertainty in the timing of injection before imaging and/or low signal-to-noise ratios.\nThe Dai lab's novel NIR-II fluorescent probe allows mapping of lymph nodes within minutes of injection, rapid renal clearance, low non-specific tissue binding, low toxicity, and higher signal-to-noise ratio (up to ~22 fold) than currently utilized indocyanine green (ICG) dyes.\n\nApplications: Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy(SLNB) in vivo optical imaging.\n\nAdvantages: Mapping of lymph nodes within minutes, rapid clearance, low non-specific tissue binding, low toxicity, high signal-to-noise."
Stanford University,Correction of polycythemia vera via CRISPR/AAV6 genome editing,Docket #: S21-197,Published Application: WO2023060059,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/correction-polycythemia-vera-crispraav6-genome-editing,"Polycythemia vera is a rare blood cancer characterized by the hyperproliferation of red blood cells, leading to coagulation events like strokes and heart attacks. There are no curative treatments available, only symptom management in the form of treatments with suboptimal side effect profiles.\nThe condition is caused by a mutation in the JAK2 gene, which could be corrected via a gene editing strategy. However, a gene editing approach remains challenging due to the need to retain activity from the wild type JAK2 allele for normal hematopoiesis. Further, the mutant site needs to be edited with near perfect efficiency to prevent the eventual expansion of the proliferative mutant populations.\nInventors at Stanford's Porteus lab have developed a CRISPR-based method in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to deactivate the JAK2 mutation most frequently altered in polycythemia vera and related myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Using a system that incorporates two guide RNAs, the inventors were able to develop a targeting method to limit insertions and deletions in exons of the wild type allele, while the mutant sequence can be specifically targeted for nuclease activity. The mutant gene is then repaired via homologous recombination, with the normal donor template delivered in an AAV6 capsid.\nIn in vitro experiments using human doner hematopoietic stem cells, the gene editing technique produced efficient replacement of the mutant JAK2 allele, with minimal impact on the wild type allele. Edited cells can subsequently be used as a starting material for autologous bone marrow transplant.\nStage of development\nIn vitro proof of concept in patient-derived HSCs, in vivo research ongoing.\n\nApplications: Potentially curative therapeutic for polycythemia vera or other JAK2-mutated MPNs, Ex vivo gene editing strategy for incorporation into stem cell transplantation protocols.\n\nAdvantages: Potential for one-time, curative treatment option."
Stanford University,Differential Proliferation of Human HSPCs Using Truncated Erythropoietin Receptors,Docket #: S21-196,Published Application: WO2023064798,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/differential-proliferation-human-hspcs-using-truncated-erythropoietin-receptors,"Researchers at Stanford have developed gene editing methods for modifying hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to express truncated forms of the erythropoietin receptor (tEPOR). The expression of tEPOR in the modified cells and their descendants, in particular in the erythropoietic lineage (e.g., red blood cells), leads to enhanced growth and/or proliferation. This enhanced growth and/or proliferation leads to the enrichment of the cells relative to unmodified cells in vitro and/or in vivo. Accordingly, when coupled with a desired trait or an additional genetic modification (e.g., to effect the expression of a therapeutic transgene), the induction of tEPOR expression in the modified cells can be used to enhance the presence of the desired and/or modified cells in vitro or in vivo. Currently, edited cell chimerism is one of the greatest bottlenecks to clinical efficacy of gene therapies for hemoglobin diseases. As a result, transplanted genetically modified HSCs often fail to proliferate or be maintained sufficiently to provide therapeutic benefit. This technology can be used to safely and effectively enhance the chimerism of edited red blood cells in patients.\nStage of Development\nThis method was tested in in vitro cell culture on human HSCs. Data were generated from proprietary sgRNA and AAV6 DNA repair templates.\n\nApplications: Genetically modified HSPCs from patients could be used in treating genetic disorders such as ?-thalassemia, ?-thalassemia, sickle cell disease, hemophilia B, phenylketonuria, mucopolysaccharidosis type 1, Gaucher disease, Krabbe disease, etc..\n\nAdvantages: Could improve efficacy in all current gene therapies for hemoglobinopathies."

By analyzing the tumor microenvironment with Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF), they have identified prognostic features that distinguish primary DCIS tumors with a high probability of recurrence and invasive disease – representing tumor progression – from tumors that will not recur. DCIS accounts for over 60,000 new breast cancer diagnoses each year in the U.S.; however, due to the lack of biomarkers to assess risk of progression to invasive disease, clinical management has trended towards treating all patients presumptively as progressors with surgery, radiation therapy, and pharmacological interventions that carry risks for therapy-related adverse events. Initial tests have shown that the newly identified prognostic features accurately identified DCIS patients that would recur with invasive disease with an AUC of 0.83. This work provides new insight into potential etiologies of DCIS progression that will guide development of future prognostic tools to improve patient management.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept. The researchers are in the process of validating the features with a blinded cohort.\n\nApplications: Prognostic test development.\n\nAdvantages: No comparable tests are currently available."

Thousands of mechanoreceptors in a finger pad allow us to distinguish various objects and their properties, such as rigidity, size, texture, among others. Engineering  a compelling fingertip haptic device for stimulating such complex interactions must balance miniaturization, multifunctionality, and manufacturability.  The origami inspired CHARM Lab fingertip haptic device design called 'FingerPrint' embeds foldable vacuum actuation and produces 4-degrees of freedom of motion on the finger pad with tunable haptic forces (including but not limited to 1.3 N shear and 7 N normal) and torque (25 N-mm), which provides a wide range of tactile and physical stimulation.

Stanford University,Use of Dopaminergic Prodrug to Prevent Myopia Progression,Docket #: S21-417,"Published Application: WO2022099195, Published Application: 20240065999",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/use-dopaminergic-prodrug-prevent-myopia-progression,"Researchers at Stanford have established the safety and penetrance of the dopaminergic prodrug etilevodopa to prevent the progression of myopia (""""nearsightedness""""). In the past 50 years, myopia prevalence in the U.S. and Europe has doubled and in China has jumped from 20% to 90% of the population. Slowing myopia progression even minimally can help prevent blindness. Despite the high prevalence, no pharmacologic treatment has been approved or cleared for myopia control by the U.S. FDA. Increasing ocular dopamine has been explored as a treatment; however, use of isolated dopaminergic agents can cause side effects such as nausea and vomiting, as well as conjunctivitis. The Stanford team's novel approach uses a dopaminergic prodrug to avoid negative effects on the eye while still allowing for penetration of medication past the ocular surface. They found that topical administration of the prodrug etilevodopa showed no evidence of retinal toxicity and warrants additional investigation as a potential therapeutic treatment for myopia.\nStage of Development\nPre-clinical. Next steps include additional animal safety/efficacy data vs. Phase I clinical trial.\n\nApplications: Ophthalmic formulation to prevent the progression of myopia.\n\nAdvantages: Establishes the safety and penetrance of the dopaminergic prodrug etilevodopa, Unlike anticholinergic agents currently in use, dopaminergics have limited effects on accommodation and no effect on pupillary dilation, In animal testing, dopaminergics are more effective at preventing myopia, Whereas even low-dose atropine 0.01% has shown potential toxicity on electroretinography, dopaminergics have not exhibited any toxicity."

Other modalities, such as MRI or CT, may require the use of anesthesia. This makes it difficult to image pediatric patients and patients sensitive to anesthesia. Due to its real-time imaging capabilities and lack of ionizing radiation, ultrasound imaging is a promising alternative to traditional diagnostic tools. The Ferrara lab at Stanford invented a low-cost, non-ionizing volumetric ultrasound imaging system that can achieve high-resolution comparable to those obtained from CT or MRI modalities. The invention leverages modular arrays of ultrasonic transducers to create large semi-cylindrical arrays seen in larger and more complex imaging systems. The 3D design enables the acquisition of MR and CT-format multi-slice images. In addition to its use for general screening and diagnosis, the invention is a highly portable technology that does not require patients to be anesthetized and does not expose subjects to ionizing radiation. This is the first volumetric imaging system that can be used for pediatric patients under 3 years old and eliminates claustrophobia induced from other imaging technologies, making the invention a valuable tool for research and clinical use.\n\nApplications: -Pediatric diagnostics and imaging, -Research tool for clinical human and pre-clinical small animal studies.\n\nAdvantages: -There are no comparable devices currently on the market, -High resolution and very fast image acquisition, -No anesthesia or radiation is needed."
Stanford University,Improved surgical navigation for robotic endoscopes and catheters,Docket #: S16-327,"Issued: 10,603,124 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/improved-surgical-navigation-robotic-endoscopes-and-catheters,"Stanford researchers developed a method that estimates the position of a robotic surgical catheter for precise control.  Data from the catheter's distal tip sensor are used to estimate the real time orientation and position of the base of the catheter's articulating region – giving surgeons more precise control during surgical navigation.   Testing-task space control in a mock bronchoscopy showed a significant improvement over model-less and model-based control strategies.  The method applies to minimally invasive procedures using robotic endoscopes and catheters.  It is especially helpful in complex areas like the lungs and heart.  More precise robotic control can reduce procedure variability and improve patient outcomes.\nStage of Research\nResearchers tested two rotation estimation models, a static model, and model-less control using an anatomically accurate silicone lung phantom.  The rotation estimation method (R?) used measured tip orientation while rotation estimation method (R?x) used measured tip displacement.   Both estimation methods complete the full trajectory by successfully estimating base rotation. Model–less control (MLC) reaches three way points before the robot steers into to the lung wall resulting in the manual termination of the run. The static model based control (MBC) run reaches only two way points and drives into the wrong branch before termination. Via rotation estimation methods, feedback control successfully navigates farther into the lung phantom than static model-based control and model-less control.\n\nApplications: Minimally invasive procedures using robotic endoscopes and catheters  (e.g. bronchoscopies, colonoscopies, cardiac ablations, cranial aneurisms, etc.).\n\nAdvantages: More accurate positioning - especially in more complicated areas like lungs and heart, Reduces procedure variability (between physicians), Algorithm can improve procedure outcome and fine motor control in robots performing catheter positioning."

Stanford University,Compressed Collagen Composite Construct (4C) for cell or therapeutic delivery,Docket #: S21-451,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/compressed-collagen-composite-construct-4c-cell-or-therapeutic-delivery,"Stanford inventors have developed a method for collagen compression along with a polymer mesh as a mechanical support to produce collagen-based composite grafts. These grafts have robust mechanical properties superior to typical collagen gels, and they maintain specific biological characteristics of collagen matrix and the viability of embedded cell types.\nThe clinical use of collagen is limited due to its poor mechanical properties. More mechanically stable and durable collagen constructs are desired in clinical applications. This novel method can generate collagen-based grafts with anchoring capabilities, sufficient flexibility, and mechanical strength to be manipulated, implanted, and sutured. These grafts are robust enough for surgical and clinical use. Moreover, these grafts can be loaded with autologous progenitor cells as well as growth factors and/or nanoparticles/microparticles. This suggests the potential of the grafts for drug delivery and tissue regenerative therapies.\nStage of development \nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Drug delivery platforms, Tissue engineering, Regenerative medicine, Reconstructive surgery.\n\nAdvantages: Flexible, Mechanically stable and durable, High viability of embedded cells."
Stanford University,Use of Organic Conductive Polymer for Multiplexed Beam Imaging,Docket #: S21-216,Published Application: WO2023064191,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/use-organic-conductive-polymer-multiplexed-beam-imaging,"Stanford inventors have developed an alternative slide coating for multiplexed ion beam imaging using a conductive organic polymer material. This new technology eliminates the high background noise from the use of gold slide coatings and improves conductivity for imaging thick, dense tissue.\nMultiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) is an imaging technology based on secondary ion beam mass spectrometry that enables the use of heavy metal isotope-conjugated antibody stains to label histological samples with a high number of cellular markers (40+). Currently, MIBI requires the use of gold in sample slides to create the conductive surface necessary to prevent surface charge accumulation which would cause inconsistent signal across the region of interest. However, in very porous tissues (like lung), exposed gold can produce a high amount of background noise, and in very dense tissues (like brain tissue), lack of conductivity can still be an issue even with gold coatings.\nIn this invention, Stanford scientists have discovered a new organic polymer material for coating MIBI slides that eliminates background noise from gold coatings and improves conductivity. This new slide design improves MIBI imaging performance over gold-coated slides and provides a transparent slide material to allow sample imaging with light-based microscopy as well.\n\nApplications: Improved slide coating material for multiplexed ion beam imaging for applications like biological research, pathology, and diagnostics.\n\nAdvantages: Reduced background noise by eliminating use of gold-coated slides, Extend life span of expensive consumable components (ion detector) of the MIBI system, Reduce data storage from gigabytes to megabytes, Improved conductivity to reduce charge accumulation for more consistent signal across sample, Improved MIBI performance, especially in larger tissue volumes and brain tissue, Transparent, allowing collection of light passed through the sample, Cost-effective high-volume production of conductive slides."
Stanford University,Implant for improved treatment of early stage osteonecrosis of the hip,Docket #: S15-027,"Published Application: WO2016154063, Issued: 10729816 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/implant-improved-treatment-early-stage-osteonecrosis-hip,"Drs. Shanjani, Yang and Goodman in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Stanford University have developed an implant that promotes generation of natural bone and vasculature for use in the treatment of early stage osteonecrosis of the hip (ONH) also known as avascular necrosis (AVN ) of the hip.  The hip is a ball and socket joint with the head of the femur (thighbone) serving as the ball.    ONH is a painful condition that occurs when blood supply to the ball (femoral head) is disrupted.  This condition can lead to collapse of the ball, subsequent arthritis and eventual need for total hip replacement.  Several surgical strategies, including core decompression of the necrotic segment of bone with or without local bone grafting , are strategies to try and preserve the hip during the early stages of the disease.  However, these options are not always successful and total hip replacement may still be needed despite the early intervention.  Thus, there is a need for improved treatment strategies for early stage ONH to provide both a biologically sound treatment and mechanical support.\nTo help meet this need the inventors have developed a biomimetic load-bearing and bioactive functionally-graded implant for reconstitution of the osteonecrotic area at early stages.  This technology will prevent the progress of osteonecrosis by promoting generation of natural bone and vasculature and will eliminate the need for total hip replacement. The implant is made by additive manufacturing technology and can be customized in terms of geometrical dimensions and internal micro-structure for the individual patient.   The manufacturing process is also very cost effective. Implantation of the device is fairly straightforward and comparable to current techniques.\nStage of research\nThe inventors have fabricated the implant and performed physical and mechanical characterization.  In addition, preliminary animal studies have been conducted and show the implant has great promise.\nRelated technology\nDr. Yang and colleagues have developed a new biodegradable, photocrosslinkable polymer (see Stanford Docket S14-265) that may be used as an alternative material to create the implant.\n\nApplications: Treatment of ONH at early stage (ARCO I and II, and early stage III), Research- tissue engineering studies, The implant can be supplemented with other biologically based additions such as growth factors, small molecules, cells, etc..\n\nAdvantages: Improves efficacy of treatment for early stage ONH, Biodegradable- implant will be replaced by natural bone, Geometrically customizable for the patient, Improved integration capability compared to current treatments, Easy to implant, Eliminates need for autologous grafts, Eliminates need for revision surgeries, Avoids total hip replacement."

Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is more reliable than current approaches for cancer detection, which may be limited by poor sensitivity, biomarker stability, and specificity. This method involves genetically encoding a tumor-specific promotor that expresses limonene, a clinically-safe VOC, in the presence of cancerous cells. Additionally, the inventors additionally present a method for VOC detection that enables several hours of sampling, which improves sensitivity by over 100-fold compared to standard VOC quantification methods. The researchers demonstrate that implanting human cancer cells with stable limonene expression in a mouse tumor model successfully enables detection of tumors as small as 5 mm. From pharmacokinetic simulations, this method is predicted to detect tumors as small as 7 mm in humans which would surpass current PET imaging detection limits.\nStage of Development \nThe inventors have demonstrated in preclinical work with cells in culture and in tumors in living mice that the VOC can be expressed and detected in metabolically engineered cells improving detection sensitivity.\n\nApplications: Surveillance testing for early cancer detection.\n\nAdvantages: Non-invasive, inexpensive, and fast method of cancer detection, Does not require sample processing or storage, Offers 100-fold improvement in sensitivity over current breath-based cancer-detection methods, May enable routine monitoring via continuous VOC expression after single administration of the gene."

It allows targeted purification of ecDNA from human cancer cells and can be used to identify genetic variants and differences in methylation profiles between ecDNA and chromosomal DNA isolated from the same cancer cell, and for non-invasive in vitro assays to diagnose cancer. EcDNA oncogene amplifications are present in half of human cancer types and up to one third of tumor samples and are associated with poor patient outcomes. Given the prevalence of ecDNA in cancer, there is an urgent need for better characterization of unique genetic and epigenetic features of ecDNA in order to understand how it may differ from chromosomal DNA and obtain clues about how it is formed and maintained in tumors.

This click chemistry technology uses bio-orthogonal SPAAC (strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition) crosslinking to provide a corneal stromal substitute based on collagen type I. The viscous injectable material could be safely applied to a wounded cornea where it reacts to form a gel scaffold able to promote tissue repair without sutures or a human donor. The gel recapitulates the thickness and smooth, continuous surface of the cornea so it can be used as a three-dimensional acellular scaffold or a scaffold that encapsulates cultured cells (keratocytes). In research applications, the scaffold could be used for three-dimensional tissue culture to synthesize lamellar substitutes or to study keratocyte-keratinocyte interactions. In wound healing applications, this technology is a promising candidate for in situ lamellar and defect reconstruction of corneal stromal tissue in cases of deep corneal ulcers to rapidly stabilize wounds or to replace a section of the cornea.\nSPAAC gel performance in organ culture model of sutureless in situ-forming anterior lamellar keratoplasty.

Metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for cooling applications due to their high water vapor absorption capacity, but have been cost-prohibitive due to the lower water recovery rates associated with low adsorption/desorption cycle frequencies.   The invention enables high productivity by rapid mass transfer of vapor by fluidization of MOFs.  Fluidization is a proven and scale-able process wherein powders are suspended in a column of air.  This fluidization dramatically increases the surface area of absorbent exposed to an airstream and also decreases diffusion length scales.

The lead compound has been shown to suppress growth of human cancer cells lines in vitro and impair tumor growth in vivo.  This is the first report of a small molecule inhibitor of the HAT1 enzyme complex and represents a step towards targeting this pathway for cancer therapy.\nHAT1, an enzyme that acetylates the histone H4, is involved in many human disorders and conditions including cancer, aging, immune diseases, organ rejection, and viral infections. It has been shown to be overexpressed in various cancers and to promote tumorigenesis, as well as to promote HIV and hepatitis (especially HBV) infection and replication. To determine whether targeting HAT1 is a viable anti-cancer treatment strategy, the researchers sought to identify small molecule inhibitors of HAT1. They developed a high-throughput, click-chemistry-enabled HAT1 acetylation assay to facilitate drug discovery and enzymology. Screening of small molecules computationally predicted to bind the active site led to the discovery of multiple riboflavin analogs that inhibited HAT1 enzymatic activity by competing with acetyl-CoA binding.

Chiral spectroscopy based on differential absorption of circularly polarized light (CPL) is a method that can help separate these closely related molecules, but the effect is generally too weak for efficient separation or sensitive detection. Nanophotonic platforms can enhance the effect by increasing the local density of optical chirality of the circularly polarized light, but metasurfaces that operate in the ultraviolet spectrum are lacking.\nScientists in the Dionne group have developed a high quality factor diamond metasurface that concentrates the local density of optical chirality up to 1130-fold to allow sensitive detection of enantiomeric molecules with CPL and enables efficient separation with a chiral column.

This technique has several advantages compared to traditional absorption-only X-ray imaging. It can perform medical imaging with a substantially higher contrast to noise ratio for soft matter (such as tumor detection) and has many applications in security screening (such as explosive material identification).\nThe system uses a non-linear optical medium which forms a change in the index of refraction or the absorption of the material when exposed to X-ray radiation. After illumination, 2 ?m diffracted light is then analyzed to measure the magnitude and location of the changes in the index of refraction or absorption of the non-linear optical medium. The relative phases which reconstruct the pattern of X-ray illumination in visible light can then be digitized using a digital camera. Thus, an X-ray hologram is transformed into a digital signal, allowing for precise reconstruction of the interior of the object.\nStage of Research\nPrototype\nRelated technologies:\n S16-173  Fates - Compact, Sensitive X-ray Differential Phase Contrast Imaging System\nS18-123\nNext Generation Explosive Detection with Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) Imaging – Artifact Removal and Automated Analysis\n\nApplications: Medical & Security CT, Dental X-ray imaging, Mammography, General X-ray imaging.\n\nAdvantages: 2.4um resolution while maintaining >80% quantum efficiency of incident x-rays."

Unlike traditional actuation-transmissions apparatuses, this method utilizes a novel 3-cable tension actuation scheme that minimizes the number of cables required to actuate a two DoF differential mechanism such as a robotic wrist.  This is an example of an N+1 actuation system where N+1 tension elements are used to actuate an N bi-directional axes of motion.  The design allows all tendons to be pulled at once to variably tighten the system without inducing torques on the differential output. (This is known as the """"homogeneous"""" solution to the force transform.)  This extra DoF can be used to minimize the loads on the differential bearings when needed and conversely can be used to increase the bearing loads to increase friction or compliance.  The design enables improved actuation of a two DoF joint such as differential.  It has applications in general mechanism use, including robotics, prosthetics, surgery, teleoperation, etc.\nImage description: Prototype of the joint.

To certify the safety of a cyber-physical system, the system must be strenuously stress-tested in a diverse range of scenarios to ensure the system is certifiably safe and robust. A key challenge is devising tools, both in terms of language and computation, to design challenging scenarios to evaluate system performance in novel settings. We address this challenge by leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL), a logic language capable of describing spatial and temporal specifications of signals, and modern machine learning programming tools, namely automatic differentiation software. Although we primarily focus on autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles settings, our resulting tool is general and can be used for automatic test scenario generation for various domains including aerospace, manufacturing, and mining.\nStage of Research\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Autonomous driving, Mining, Aerospace, Automated construction, Cyber-physical systems.\n\nAdvantages: Non-transitory computer-readable medium of evaluating a test case using at least one parameter solved via the parametric temporal logic formula, Incorporation of logical specifications into problems in a way that is amenable to gradient computation for solution methods."

While it is easier for a system to process that there is a pedestrian already crossing the street, predicting whether a pedestrian will or will not cross is more difficult. To approach this issue, Stanford researchers have developed a framework based on graph convolution to uncover the spatiotemporal relationships in the scene for reasoning about pedestrian intent. The scene graph is built on top of the segmented instances within and across video frames for both pedestrian-centric and location-centric models. These are then fed into a gated recurrent unit which predicts future crossing actions. Early results from the spatiotemporal relationship model predict intent to cross accurately ~80% of the time about 1s before a pedestrian actually crosses.\nImage description: Diagram of the evaluation process.

This requires predicting both human poses and human trajectories based on keypoints in an egocentric setting. One of the key challenges is the lack of annotated egocentric video datasets with dense pose annotation. This required the inventors to use pretrained models to generate noisy annotations which were then used to train the pedestrian forecasting models. The noisy annotations were disentangled to separate locomotion into global movement (pedestrian trajectory) and local movement (pose keypoint movements). This allows the system to predict human locomotion even when the pose keypoint data is incomplete and merges at the end to allow for faster prediction.\nStage of Research\nPrototype\n\nApplications: Self-driving and autonomous cars, Driver-assistance systems.\n\nAdvantages: Considers both large scale trajectorial motion and finer body limb movements, Overcomes the challenge of scarce human annotate pedestrian pose datasets."

EVs continuously shed within the TME contain the cytoplasmic and membrane contents of their parental cells and are rapidly taken up by adjacent cells. It is known that tumor-derived EVs may interfere with immune therapies, and EV cross-talk can influence major tumor-related pathways such as hypoxia-driven epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cancer stemness, angiogenesis, and metastasis involving many cell types within the TME. The Stanford team has shown that infusion of rh-Annexin V (AnxV), a well-described safe human protein with nanomolar affinity for externalized membrane bound phosphatidylserine (PS), can block the uptake of PS+ EVs shed within the TME and inhibit EV-driven pro-tumoral transcriptomic transformation of tumor-associated immune, neo-angiogenic and stromal cells. They further show that irradiated orthotopic 4T1 murine mammary carcinomas transform the TME towards a pro-tumoral, immunosuppressive and neo-angiogenic transcriptome as determined by RNAseq analyses which can be reversed with systemic infusions of AnxV.\nStage of Development\nThe researchers have demonstrated that extracellular AnxV not only can inhibit PS-mediated phagocytosis/efferocytosis and PS receptor signaling pathways as described previously, but can reduce and/or reverse the pro-tumoral transcriptomic changes within the tumor microenvironment one week following a single 20 Gy dose of gamma radiation delivered to orthotopic 4T1 murine mammary carcinomas.\n\nApplications: Inhibition of pro-tumoral transformation of immune, stromal, and vascular cells mediated by EVs/exosomes shed by tumor cells, AnxV treatment may be combined with a second anti-cancer therapy, e.g., radiation therapy, checkpoint inhibitor therapy, chemotherapy, CAR-T cell therapy, administration of anti-tumor antibodies, and targeted cancer therapy.\n\nAdvantages: New high potential therapeutic concept."

The only currently approved viral therapy, T-vec (Talimogene laherparepvec), suffers from off-target effects that limit its use to intratumoral injection, toxicity to normal tissues, and limited antitumor efficacy.  Other viral treatments under development suffer from the same limitations of off-target toxicity and lack of on-target efficacy.\nThe Lin Lab integrated a synthetic signaling construct (ErbB-RASER) that drives activity only in the presence of constitutively active ErbB, a kinase mutated to be hyperactive in numerous cancer types. ErbB-RASER by design does not block ErbB but it re-directs the signal activity to therapeutic response which reduces the occurrence of the resistance.  The construct was integrated into the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), where only ErbB-positive cells replicated the virus, with specific cell-killing ability across breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer cells.  Research is ongoing.\nThis technology for controlling viruses from the Lin Lab is the only engineered method for controlling viral replication based on hyperactive biochemical signaling in cancer cells.\nStage of Development\nResearch In Vitro\n\nApplications: Targeted cancer therapy, Oncolytic viral therapy.\n\nAdvantages: Greater specificity and antitumor efficacy than existing oncolytic viruses, Minimizes off-target toxicity, Retains wild type signaling from mutated kinases."

Current treatments that attempt to modify the action of neurotransmitters usually target their receptors and have yet to effectively treat many of the conditions that scientists know to be related to excitatory-inhibitory imbalance.\nThis technology developed in the Montine lab includes a series of small molecule compositions that are enantiomers of glutamic acid derivatives and instead influence neurotransmitter metabolism to modify excitatory versus inhibitory brain signaling. These molecules penetrate the blood-brain barrier and act in an enantiomer-selective manner, showing low toxicity. The Montine lab recently has shown that one of these enantiomers reverses the motor deficits in two different mouse models of Parkinson's disease (both toxin and transgenic models), and reverses the working memory deficit in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. These properties and this novel therapeutic strategy make this compound series extremely promising for the treatment of a number of previously intractable diseases of the central nervous system.\nStage of Development\nThe Montine Lab has investigated metabolic stability, brain uptake and other biochemical properties of the compound; in vitro and in vivo. They are now focused on cell and animal based experiments.\n\nApplications: Treatment of central nervous system conditions including neurodevelopmental, psychiatric/behavioral, and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nAdvantages: Proven penetration of blood-brain barrier, Low toxicity, Enantiomer-selective activity on neurotransmitter metabolism, Targets metabolism of neurotransmitters instead of their receptor engagement, representing a novel treatment strategy, Broad range of potential applications for previously intractable diseases characterized by disregulation of the central nervous system."

Stanford University,A Bioscaffold-Based Platform for Improved Islet Transplantation,Docket #: S20-274,Published Application: 20230256196,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/bioscaffold-based-platform-improved-islet-transplantation,"Stanford inventors have developed technologies for improved islet transplantation using a bioscaffold platform that maintains islet health during and after their transplantation.\nIslet transplantation is a ?-cell replacement therapy used to treat diabetic patients who lack the ability to secrete insulin. The conventional site for islet transplantation is the liver, however, this is far from optimal given that islets are subjected to hypoxia, toxic metabolites from the liver, a pro-inflammatory environment and an instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR); together, this results in up to 60-70% of islets being immediately lost following transplantation. Furthermore, given that islet transplantation does not require the creation of a surgical vascular anastomosis, islets therefore need to build and secure a dedicated blood supply, which takes at least 3 weeks. In the interim, islets have to survive by relying on the diffusion of oxygen and nutrients (such as essential amino acids like glutamine and alanine) from the microenvironment of the transplantation site, which results in them enduring significant stress and bioenergetic depletion.\nAccordingly, Stanford inventors have addressed several critical problems in the transplantation process with innovative and clinically translatable solutions that will maintain islet health and survival during and following their transplantation. They have developed and validated a novel collagen based cryogel 3D matrix that incorporates an oxygen generator to address the problem of insufficient oxygen which causes islet hypoxia. They also developed a nutrient generator in the form of a mesoporous silica nanoparticle that releases amino acids which can be combined with our bioscaffold.  Each of these technologies has been shown to facilitate islet engraftment, function and survival to allow them to reserve hyperglycemia in diabetic animals.  They also demonstrate excellent long-term biocompatibility as tested using our bioscaffold in the subcutaneous space and fat pad (i.e. omentum) in animals.  This platform can also be used with stem cell derived beta cells and can be scaled and produced conforming to GMP guidelines for human use.\n\nApplications: Bioscaffold platform for islet transplantation.\n\nAdvantages: Improved biocompatibility, Reduced inflammatory responses, More conducive to cells via improved oxygen and nutrient delivery and reduced exposure to toxic metabolites, Can be used with stem cell-derived islets."

Stanford researchers have developed an electrochemical dechlorination method that circumvents the need for bisulfate. Stainless steel cathodes tested in a batch reactor were able to degrade chloramines within 20 minutes, making this a viable method for municipal scale flow reactors. Smaller scale devices could also be utilized in homes and buildings to provide dechlorinated drinking water.\nStage of Research\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Wastewater treatment, Water dechlorination.\n\nAdvantages: Eliminates need to use expensive bisulfate, Avoids increasing salinity of treated water, Eliminates chlorine taste from water."

Stanford University,Wearable device to treat hyperhidrosis,Docket #: S16-358,"Issued: 10,406,348 (USA), Issued: 11,331,472 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/wearable-device-treat-hyperhidrosis,"A team of Stanford researchers has invented a product that can be used to provide relief to patients with hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), with a particular focus on palmar hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating of the hands). Palmar hyperhidrosis is a dermatologic condition that affects ~1-2% of Americans and has a dramatic impact on quality of life. However, current treatment options suffer from a variety of drawbacks. They can be: ineffective in many patients (antiperspirants); expensive (Botulinum toxin); risky and invasive (surgery); or inconvenient and uncomfortable (tap water iontophoresis). This new device overcomes those issues by applying the principles of iontophoresis without a tap water bath. Instead, electrical current is delivered through an electrode set powered by a wearable generator. For palmar hyperhidrosis, the electrode set can be combined with a specially designed glove to help maintain constant contact with overactive sweat glands while allowing freedom of movement. This improves comfort and convenience by reducing tingling sensations during therapy and decreasing the time dedicated to the treatment.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed and bench-tested a prototype of the device. They also own intellectual property on other components of this wearable iontophoresis technology.\n\nApplications: Hyperhidrosis device - to reduce sweat on palms, with potential applications for feet or other body parts.\n\nAdvantages: Convenient and comfortable:, Wearable device allows users to move freely and use hands while undergoing treatment, Could improve compliance compared to conventional tap water iontophoresis devices which limit mobility and are messy to set up, Reduced tingling sensations during therapy compared to conventional iontophoresis, Non-invasive - no surgery or painful injections, Localized administration - only delivers current to sweat glands as defined by the electrode set rather than the entire hand."

An extensive list of current FDA-approved drug therapies that mimic C2orf54 proteins was identified; bringing the drug to the market sooner and allowing tremendous cost savings.  C2orf54 proteins help decrease tumorigenesis by stabilizing the RET proto-oncogene.  These proteins are downregulated in SCC and were identified by a transcriptome-based screen for novel open reading frames (ORF).  When the drug mimic was administered to a humanized Ras-driven SCC mouse model, tumor progression was shown to be significantly suppressed.  The research was able to highlight several drugs that target key cancer mechanisms such as HDAC inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, and PI3K inhibitors, and provide therapeutic candidates.  According to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the C2orf54 protein is frequently deleted in 21 common cancer types and these deletions are associated with decreased survival rate.  As of now, there are over 1 million cases of SCC diagnosed in the U.S. each year and 15,000 of those people end up dying.   Current therapies/research are tedious, unpredictable, and require frequent monitoring so alternative therapies like this one are needed.\nFigure\nFigure description:  The addition of C2orf54 decreases invasion (absence of Keratin 5-positive cells beneath the basement membrane), which is shown on the right compared to the control (altered primary keratinocytes) on the left.

Specifically, they have developed methods for in vitro generation of functional human cortico-striatal-midbrain-thalamic-cortical (CSMTC) spheroids by functionally integrating brain-region specific organoids. Complete CSMTC spheroids are assembled from component cultured cell systems, each designed to provide specific sets of neural cells. These functionally integrated cells interact in a physiologically relevant manner (e.g. forming synapses or neuromuscular junctions, transmitting signals, inducing muscle contractions, forming multicellular structures, etc.). This technology enables reconstruction of a """"direct"""" cortico-basal ganglia pathway in vitro from parts derived from human pluripotent stem cells. The methods generate 3D self-organizing cultures (also known as organoids or spheroids) that resemble the human cerebral cortex, the human diencephalon including thalamus, human midbrain and human striatum, and then integrate them in various combinations and spatial arrangements that allow formation of reciprocal connections and enable loop circuit-like properties.\nCurrently, researchers have limited access to intact, functional human brain tissue to probe and manipulate CSMTC loop circuits. There remains a great need for human cellular models that can functionally integrate components of the corticospinal tract circuit, allowing screening for new therapies for patients with implicated disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\nStage of Development\nThe researchers have demonstrated successful assembly of four-loop assembloids from human cortical spheroids (hCS), human striatum spheroids (hStrS), human midbrain spheroids (hMbS) and human diencephalic spheroids (hDiS).\n\nApplications: Biological understanding of human neural circuit assembly, Modeling of disorders of the CSMTC loop, including OCD, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, Large scale viral screening for circuit-specific gene therapy, Large scale small molecule screening in human pluripotent stem cell-derived CSMTC.\n\nAdvantages: First preparation fo this kind.

Stanford University,Microfluidic Magnetic Separation Device for Isolation of a Target Cell from Whole Blood,Docket #: S21-328,Published Application: WO2023044161,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/microfluidic-magnetic-separation-device-isolation-target-cell-whole-blood,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a magnetophoretic separation device (MSD) for isolating basophils and other rare cell types from a blood sample. The device applies exponentially increasing magnetic field strength to flowing magnetically tagged cells. Immunomagnetic negative selection of target cells is used to maintain target cells in their native, unlabeled state. The device is suitable for isolating cells from low volumes of whole blood, which provides an advantage over in-bulk methods that require larger starting volumes of blood. While microfluidics has emerged as a promising technology for the precise separation and isolation of cells, current methods lack a streamlined approach for applying magnetophoretic forces that are compatible with downstream microfluidic process flows. Existing on-chip magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) methods generally require the integration of multiple inlets/outlets and require a precise alignment with off-chip magnets, otherwise the isolation purity is compromised. The new device does not require careful alignment and is reusable, with its only consumable being tubing through which the cell suspension flows.\nOverview of the basophil isolation device (iBID) process flow (image credit: the inventors)\nStage of Development\nThe researchers have found that their MSD allows for the isolation of basophils from 100 uL volumes of blood with consistently high purity (>90%) and recovery (>90%). This is in contrast to commercial kits using magnetic columns that are incompatible with processing such small starting volumes of blood and are unable to achieve such consistently high purity and recovery.\n\nApplications: Commercial and research applications requiring purified leukocyte subtypes (e.g., neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes), Faster single-cell RNA-sequencing – an emerging microfluidics technology that requires purified sub-populations of the cell of interest, Isolation of basophils to support on-chip basophil activation testing for food allergy diagnosis, Isolation from whole blood is compatible with ex vivo stimulation in immune functional assays, Compatible with downstream microfluidics workflows.\n\nAdvantages: High purity and recovery (>90%) of target cells, Faster MSD-enhanced isolation methods can improve cell viability and avoid potential changes to the cell phenotype that could occur throughout the course of an in-bulk isolation process, Robust and reusable, Adaptable to a variety of form factors and easily parallelizable, Cells isolated from whole blood without washing steps or prior red blood cell depletion."
Stanford University,Percutaneous minimally invasive neochordal device for mitral valve repair,Docket #: S19-432,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/percutaneous-minimally-invasive-neochordal-device-mitral-valve-repair,"Stanford researchers have developed a new transcatheter, minimally invasive neochordal device for repair of mitral regurgitation, which does not require open heart surgery nor cardiopulmonary bypass. As opposed to existing percutaneous neochord devices, which usually utilize a transapical approach via an incision at the apex of the heart, this device is administered percutaneously, entering the venous system and targeting the mitral valve through the atrial septum. This geometry allows for direct positioning of the neochord on the posterior left ventricular myocardium, a surgery known as called posterior ventricular anchoring neochordal repair. Dr. Joseph Woo, renowned chairman and surgeon of Stanford Cardiothoracic Surgery, invented this procedure, which has been shown to provide tremendous repair results and patient outcomes.\nAdditionally, recent studies have shown that the shorter neochordal length, accomplished with posterior left ventricular targeting, results in reduced forces on the neochord and surrounding existing chordal architecture, translating to very low failure rates, reduced fatigue damage, greater repair durability, and outstanding patient outcomes. This new invention directly addresses some of the largest concerns regarding treatment of one of the most prevalent valvular diseases in the world, and enables a higher quality repair without the trauma of major surgery nor the rare expertise of surgeons from high volume treatment centers, leveraging advanced, minimally invasive transcatheter technologies of the future.\nFigure\nStage of Development\n\nApplications: Transcatheter mitral regurgitation repair in a beating heart.\n\nAdvantages: Minimally invasive: This device and approach does not require open heart surgery or cardiopulmonary bypass., High quality repair technique: The device is a repair and not a valve replacement, preserving the native structures and biomechanics as much as possible., Reduced chordal strains: Shorter length neochord due to posterior left ventricular positioning results in reduced strain in the neochord and surrounding chordal architecture, translating to reduce fatigue and increased durability of the repair and device, which has been shown in the referenced publication., Low failure rates: Reduced strains directly result in reduced failure and increased durability., Entirely percutaneous and minimally invasive: Percutaneous approach facilitates a minimally invasive technique, which improves recovery times and reduces surgical complications., Transcatheter delivery method: the invention leverages futuristic transcatheter approaches, which allows for wide adoption and clear avenues for robotic integration and manipulation.."

The Stanford technology envisions a freely suspended swimming """"robot"""" that can be placed in a fluid remotely, and via its motion creates various measures (e.g., swimming speed, rotational velocity, etc.) and reports them to a remote data collector in real time to determine local fluid properties. The scale and location of the robot determine the scale and location of the mechanical properties measured, and in principle the robot can be steered to a location of interest. The size of the robot can be varied from a few microns to meter size, and the scale of the robot also determines the scale of the volume of fluid necessary for measurement – thus in principle very small volumes of fluid in its native environment can be assessed.

Stanford University,Genetically modified immune cells increase potency of adoptive immunotherapy,Docket #: S20-068,Published Application: 20230248824,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/genetically-modified-immune-cells-increase-potency-adoptive-immunotherapy,"The potency of cancer immunotherapies for solid tumors are often diminished by inadequate metabolic reprogramming and resulting immune evasion in cancer. To acquire a fully activated state upon antigen encounter, T cells must undergo metabolic reprogramming to support cell growth, proliferation, and cytotoxic function. This reprogramming is sensitive to regulation of nutrient transporters and nutrient availability. Unfortunately, the tumor microenvironment in cancer is associated with limited nutrients due to competition between the tumor cells and infiltrating immune cells.\nThe Mackall lab invented a method to metabolically enhance immune cells during immunotherapy. Through the regulation of a group of genes, the invention leads to enhanced metabolic reprogramming and subsequently increases immune cell activation, cytokine secretion and tumor killing. The invention also functionally restores exhausted T cells and can be applied to immune cells expressing natural receptors, or those engineered to express antigen specific receptors such as chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and recombinant TCRs.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept – in vivo\nPatent Status\nPCT application filed\n\nApplications: CAR-T Cell Therapy, TCR Therapy, Other adoptive cell therapies.\n\nAdvantages: Enhancement of immune cell cytotoxic function, proliferation and persistence, Improvement of effector function of exhausted and non-exhausted cells, Can be regulated by drug on/off systems."

However, major challenges remain for the treatment of solid tumors, requiring more potent and longer lasting anti-tumor effectors.\nTo improve adoptive immune cell performance, the inventors have identified a group of genes that controls the T-cell function. Disrupting these genes enables T-cells to be more proliferative, produce more inflammatory cytokines, and demonstrate increased anti-cancer cytotoxicity. With recent advances in the field where CRISPR edited CAR-T cells have been used safely in humans, and with the technology for GMP CRISPR edited cells under further development, adoptive cell therapeutics could be improved by incorporating an edit to this set of genes into existing workflows.\nStage of Development\nIn vivo.\n\nApplications: Additional modification to adoptive cell therapies:\n\nEnhance T-cells with disruption of a gene/group of genes\nPotential application to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, macrophages, or natural killer cells, Enhance T-cells with disruption of a gene/group of genes, Potential application to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, macrophages, or natural killer cells.\n\nAdvantages: T-cells are more proliferative and demonstrate increased anti-cancer cytotoxicity, Can be incorporated into existing T-cell workflows."

Stanford University,Method for Avoiding Spurious Modes in Piezoelectric Based DC-DC Converters,Docket #: S21-346,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/method-avoiding-spurious-modes-piezoelectric-based-dc-dc-converters,"Researchers at Stanford have developed the first known fixed-frequency control method to enable piezoelectric based power converters to avoid spurious mode and operate across a full output power range while maintaining high efficiency.

Piezoelectric based DC-DC converters are well suited for miniaturization and integration, and are especially promising for applications that prohibit magnetic material (e.g., MRI machines). However, they suffer from spurious modes, which cause high loss regions and adversely impact the ideal operating frequency range of devices. Existing methods for controlling piezoelectric based DC-DC converters are insufficient, causing output power to depend on switching frequency. Realizing commercial piezoelectric based DC-DC converter necessitates converters that can operate over a full output power range.\nStage of Development\nPrototype\n\nApplications: Commercial piezoelectric based DC-DC converters, Closed-loop, hysteretic control with fast transients, Current work has focused on piezoelectric resonators but also could apply to piezoelectric transformers.\n\nAdvantages: First known method for avoiding spurious modes in piezoelectric DC-DC converters, Decouples output power and frequency, Enables a full output power range, Can enable new ways of controlling converters in addition to providing better performance."
Stanford University,Quantifiable heavy metal detection in immune cells,Docket #: S21-240,Published Application: WO2023049805,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/quantifiable-heavy-metal-detection-immune-cells,"Inventors at Stanford developed a method to leverage mass cytometry, a type of flow cytometry utilizing mass spectrometry, for the detection of heavy metals in leukocytes from individuals exposed to heavy metals in elevated air pollution.  The method uses a cell-staining process with antibodies conjugated with heavy metals. These heavy metals, such as lanthides, are typically in low abundance in the environment and biological systems. By monitoring channels in the range of the cytometry time-of-flight (CyTOF) machine while running a standardized CyTOF experiment on cells from individual blood samples, the method can detect the heavy content of the cells for those """"open"""" channels. These channels included, but are not restricted to, bromide, cadmium, antimony, tantalum, tungsten, mercury, and lead isotopes. The first-of-its-kind method that identifies immune cell types at the single-cell level and simultaneously quantifies cell surface or intracellular heavy metal content will facilitate the early detection of harmful metals and heavy metal exposure in the environment and how these metals interact with specific cell phenotypes.\nStage of Development\nIn Vitro Research\n\nApplications: Cell marker identification, Metal isotope identification, Cellular research and immunotoxicology tool applicable to:\n\nMetal toxin inhalation (i.e., wildfires, air pollution)\nMetal toxin ingestion (i.e., paints, contaminated water or soil, forensic cases)\nAmong other routes of exposure, Metal toxin inhalation (i.e., wildfires, air pollution), Metal toxin ingestion (i.e., paints, contaminated water or soil, forensic cases), Among other routes of exposure.\n\nAdvantages: First method to detect heavy metals in cells, Compatible for all cell types, Integrates with available flow and mass cytometers."

Stanford University,Predicting anthracycline treatment response in cancer patients,Docket #: S18-216,Published Application: WO2020205807,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/predicting-anthracycline-treatment-response-cancer-patients,"Researchers at Stanford University's Curtis Laboratory have used gene expression to categorize the sensitivity and resistance of anthracycline chemotherapy in breast cancer patients with utmost precision.  This discovery can be used to develop a first in class predictive diagnostic assay to hone-in on individuals at risk of anthracycline's lethal complications (such as cardiotoxicity and increased tumor metastasis).  Additionally, new therapeutic strategies may be developed by utilizing this critical software database.\nPhysicians base their treatment on observations like age, nymph node positive, ER, Her2 to administer anthracycline chemotherapy, but there is no way to predict which individuals are at risk of the toxic side effects or which ones would benefit from further treatment.  Even with the potentially lethal risks, anthracyclines (such as doxorubicin and epirubicin) are still used in 30% of early stage breast cancer patients because it can also be highly effective when administered to the right patient.\nThe study was conducted in a cohort of more than 1,000 women with early-stage breast cancer and in human breast cancer cell lines.  It is known that anthracyclines inhibit topoisomerase II (TOP2) on DNA.  Building on this fact, researchers were able to identify certain chromatin regulatory genes that alter TOP2 to predict anthracycline response in cells whether it be negatively or positively.\nBy utilizing this data, researchers developed a robust signature and set of biomarkers that will allow providers to cater the most effective treatment to patients without the negative side effects – perhaps, revolutionizing cancer treatment.  The extensive database (larger than any other available signatures) categorizes the specific biomarkers by testing and validating the gene expressions with those breast cancer patients that have been treated and not treated.  This allows for a far superior predictive value than any other systems in the market.  Moreover, this type of specific and reverse engineering of biomarkers has not been done by any other lab and verifies that this discovery is clinically applicable – better patient outcomes, survival rates, therapy choices, and quality of life.\nStage of Development:\nInventors used in vitro (cell line) molecular and drug sensitivity data to identify genes associated with anthracycline treatment response and integrated this further with patient molecular data.  Research is ongoing to refine and discover additional biomarkers.\n\nApplications: Genetic data can be used to develop a predictive diagnostic assay in response to anthracycline chemotherapy, Broad scope of therapeutic use:  applicable to other cancer tissues besides breast tissue.\n\nAdvantages: Superior to any other methodological methods on the market, More robust and better predictive value, Only system to compare treated and non-treated samples to assess whether there is a significant difference in biomarker(s) expression, Provides a platform for further insights, Improves patient outcomes by minimizing toxicities, Solves an unmet medical need – there is no test for choice of chemotherapy, Guides treatment decisions for cancer, Increased quality of life for the survivor post treatment."
Stanford University,Expressed Cellular Barcodes to enable simultaneous lineage tracing and single cell phenotypic measurements,Docket #: S18-243,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/expressed-cellular-barcodes-enable-simultaneous-lineage-tracing-and-single-cell,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a method using expressed genetic barcodes to enable simultaneous lineage tracing and single cell profiling.  Intratumor heterogeneity fosters tumor evolution which is a key contributor to therapeutic failure and the lethality of cancer.  To more effectively fight cancer, intratumor heterogeneity and tumor evolution need to be considered.  Sequencing methods have been developed to help analyze and understand tumor evolution but they are not optimal.  To help overcome the limitations of the existing methods the inventors have developed this technology.  It is a sequencing-based ultra-high resolution lineage tracing and single cell phenotyping system for mammalian cells.  It uses an expressed genetic barcode to capture subclone specific DNA, RNA or protein expression.  This enables quantification of clonal dynamics and identification of functional determinants of this process. The technology can be used in therapeutic development and tumor diagnostics as it enables robust mapping of cellular identity to phenotype thereby allowing delineation of  genotype to phenotype maps in cancer.\nStage of research\nIn vitro and in vivo proof-of-concept studies have been performed and show great promise.  Additional development is ongoing.\n\nApplications: Research tool- barcoding for lineage tracing and single cell phenotyping, Tumor diagnostics and therapeutic development:, Study clonal evolution, Delineate genotype to phenotype map in development and cancer, Identify functional determinants of clonal outgrowth, Quantify clonal dynamics, Quantify rare subclones, Monitor clonal dynamics of immune repertoires during immunotherapy.\n\nAdvantages: Enables simultaneous mapping of cellular lineage to functional determinants of clonal outgrowth, Allows simultaneous lineage tracing and single cell profiling, Provides functional information about subclones that is not obtainable using conventional barcoding methods, Enables quantification of rare subclones, Includes software to analyze barcodes at the DNA and RNA levels, Compared to evolvable barcodes, this barcode does not suffer from inherent problem of expression of Cas9 and risk of identical barcodes being altered in multiple different lineages, Method is tunable, Method is cost effective."
Stanford University,Biomarkers Predict Response to HER2-Targeted Breast Cancer Therapies,Docket #: S19-458,Published Application: 20230047712,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/biomarkers-predict-response-her2-targeted-breast-cancer-therapies,"Researchers at Stanford have leveraged spatial proteomic analysis to identify biomarkers with immediate implications for HER2-positive breast cancer treatment decision making and patient stratification. By comparing protein marker levels in the on-treatment """"run-in"""" biopsy versus the pre-treatment """"baseline"""" biopsy, they have demonstrated that they can predict response to neoadjuvant HER2-targeted therapy in HER2- positive breast cancer, thus determining which patients will achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR) and which will not after just one cycle of targeted therapy. Currently, there are no available biomarkers apart from the HER2 oncogene itself to predict patient outcomes during neoadjuvant HER2- targeted therapy. Such biomarkers could be used to escalate/de-escalate or change therapy and address a pressing clinical need. Importantly, the biomarkers reported here could be assessed (and likely re-discovered) using conventional immunohistochemistry which can readily be deployed in a clinical setting.\nStage of Development\nIn vivo. The researchers continue to validate their findings in additional clinical trial samples and using other methods (e.g., standard and multiplexed immunohistochemistry).\n\nApplications: Biomarkers to inform the development of an in vitro diagnostic assay based on proteomic analysis of breast tumor biopsies.\n\nAdvantages: There is critical need to identify biomarkers that predict response before or early in the course of therapy, Could enable clinicians to tailor and potentially adapt/alter therapy."
Stanford University,Directed Assembly of Layered Perovskite Heterostructures as Single Crystals,Docket #: S21-206,"Published Application: WO2022266238, Published Application: 20240271324",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/directed-assembly-layered-perovskite-heterostructures-single-crystals,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a new synthetic strategy for self-assembling layered heterostructures into large single crystals and films useful in microelectronics. Given the technological promise of halide perovskites, this intuitive synthetic route sets a foundation for the directed synthesis of richly structured complex semiconductors that self-assemble in water. The method may be applied to perovskites or more generally to other heterostructures with two different 2D materials. The coupling of two different inorganic lattices can form materials that show a combination of properties (e.g., a magnetic lattice and a conductive lattice can show magnetoresistance). Further, the heterostructure can show new emergent properties not seen in the individual 2D parent structures (e.g., excitons delocalized between both layers). Conventionally, most heterostructures are formed by manipulating one monolayer at a time. The new approach is much more scalable, allowing for gram-scale synthesis of heterostructures at room temperature in water.\nStage of Development\nAs reported in a 2021 paper in Nature, the new approach yields products as single crystals, crystalline powders, and thin films that can be deposited from solution.\n\nApplications: These material have promise in microelectronics.\n\nAdvantages: More scalable, versatile and milder than existing methods, Allows two different 2D inorganic materials to be merged into one material, Depending on the 2D parent materials, the functionality of the heterostructure can be different (e.g., luminescent, magnetic, conductive, photoconductive materials can be coupled using this method)."
Stanford University,Lamb-Wave Mode-Conversion Based Neurostimulation Device,Docket #: S21-336,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/lamb-wave-mode-conversion-based-neurostimulation-device,"We present a simple, and cost-effective ultrasound device for in-vitro neurostimulation to facilitate fundamental and advanced research in the field. The effect of ultrasound on excitable biological tissue has been studied since 1920s but the exact mechanisms of the phenomenon are not fully discovered or understood yet. Previous and current approaches using focused, or planar ultrasound transducers inevitably experience attenuation of plane waves in a coupling medium and are bulky and complicated to be coupled with high-resolution imaging/recording techniques.\nWe developed new type of ultrasound neurostimulation device using lamb-wave mode-conversion principle to improve the delivery of ultrasound and reduce the complexity of the in-vitro and ex-vivo experimental setup. The device consists of a piezoelectric cylinder, a 250 µm thick glass coverslip as a specimen stage, and surrounding glass wall. Working in radial mode vibration, the piezoelectric cylinder induces lamb-waves in the glass coverslip and the antisymmetric mode lamb-waves below approximately 1 MHz, which have phase velocities slower than that of the biological solution or water in the specimen stage. These propagate through the glass coverslip, converge at the center, and then leak into the biological specimen. These improved propagation conditions minimize loss and improve spatial resolution of the delivered ultrasound wave. Notably, the piezoelectric cylinder can be frequency tuned for different tissue types making this useful for neuromodulation devices as well as high-resolution live-cell and tissue imaging techniques.\nStage of Research\n\nApplications: Ultrasound neuromodulation devices, Microscope add-on.\n\nAdvantages: Improved spatial resolution and minimized loss of delivered ultrasound wave, Higher acoustic impedance for better propagation conditions, Thin geometry glass coverslip as a waveguide path."
Stanford University,Magnetic medical device for efficient removal of kidney stones during ureteroscopy,Docket #: S20-453,"Published Application: WO2023220755, Published Application: 20240207188, Issued: 11,903,666 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/magnetic-medical-device-efficient-removal-kidney-stones-during-ureteroscopy,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed a new medical device, MagSToNE (Magnetic System for Total Nephrolith Extraction), which utilizes magnetization to remove kidney stones during ureteroscopy to maximize the stone-free rate and minimize operating time. Surgical management of kidney stone disease includes ureteroscopy, in which a ureteroscope is passed endoscopically up to the stone and a laser fiber is used to fragment/and or dust the stone. While fragmentation and active retrieval of stone fragments achieves higher stone-free rates, it is often associated with a significantly longer operating time as fragments are extracted one by one with a basket. Dusting creates smaller fragments which are left in the kidney and are assumed to pass spontaneously in the urine, however this assumption is not true in all patients.\nComplete stone clearance is desirable, as residual stone fragments can re-obstruct the ureter and are associated with complications such as emergency room visits and repeat surgery. Only 60-75% of ureteroscopic treatments achieve complete stone-free status, and around 30% of patients with even small ( 2 mm) residual fragments experience stone-related complications.\nThe MagSToNE technology provides a solution to improve surgical efficiency and efficacy by quickly removing stone fragments and achieving more complete stone clearance. The invention consists of two components, a small-diameter flexible magnetic wire (MagWIRE) and superparamagnetic particles with surface chemistries that bind to kidney stones. After a kidney stone is fragmented, a superparamagnetic particle solution is instilled through the ureteral access sheath and coats the fragments, rendering them magnetizable. The MagWIRE is able to enter through the ureteroscope or the access sheath and uses a unique magnetic configuration to generate a strong magnetic field to optimize the capture of stone fragment along the entire length of the wire (Figure 1).\nThe MagWIRE can quickly pass in and out multiple times to retrieve multiple fragments with each pass, resulting in the efficient and effective removal of all fragments. This device is designed to work with existing ureteroscopy setups, making it a convenient tool to incorporate into urology practices and presents a great opportunity for companies involved in kidney stone management devices.\nStage of Research\nIn vitro studies were performed with iron oxide particles of a range of sizes (7 nm to 4.5 µm) and kidney stones of a variety of compositions (calcium phosphate (CaPO4), calcium oxalate monohydrate (CaOxM), uric acid, and struvite). Particles ranging from 50 nm to 3 µm in diameter facilitate the magnetic capture of > 90% of calcium phosphate stone fragments  1 mm in diameter (Figure 2). Ferumoxytol, an FDA-approved nanoparticle used intravenously for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia, also performs satisfactorily. Larger 1 µm particles perform more consistently across a range of stone compositions, also achieving > 90% capture of stone fragments  1 mm in size (Figure 3). For stones  1mm, when compared to conventional basket retrieval, the MagSToNE system retrieved > 10-fold more stone and performed 20 times faster (Table 1).\nResearch is ongoing to further optimize the particle surface chemistry, particle delivery, and wire design to facilitate capture of larger stone fragments. Particle biocompatibility and proof of concept studies are planned for porcine models.\nFigure 1:\nFigure 2:\nFigure 3:\nTable:\n\nApplications: Efficiently removes kidney stone fragments using magnetization in stone procedures. Designed for use in ureteroscopy but can also be applied to percutaneous nephrolithomy (PCNL) and cystoscopy for bladder stones..\n\nAdvantages: Maximizes stone free rate while minimizing operative time, Able to remove small fragments that are difficult to retrieve with conventional baskets, MagWIRE has slim profile similar to existing guide wires used for ureteroscopy, MagWIRE has been well-characterized, studied and prototyped in a previous application (see publication), Designed to work with existing ureteroscopy setups, Currently no magnetic stone extraction technologies in commercial use, Can potentially utilize an existing FDA-approved nanoparticle to facilitate clinical translation."
Stanford University,Early Detection and Treatment of Colorectal Cancer Based on Metastatic Potential,Docket #: S19-326,Published Application: WO2020257353,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/early-detection-and-treatment-colorectal-cancer-based-metastatic-potential,"Researchers at Stanford have developed methods of diagnosing and treating colorectal cancer based on the discovery of genetic aberrations indicative of a patient's risk of metastasis. These genomic biomarkers can be readily screened for in tumor tissue and blood plasma, and can inform the therapeutic approach. There is a critical need to define biomarkers of aggressive disease, including those associated with lethal metastasis, to stratify patients for more aggressive or targeted therapeutic approaches. Up to 80% of metastatic colorectal cancers are likely to have spread to distant locations in the body before the original tumor has exceeded the size of a poppy seed. The detection of biomarkers of aggressive disease in early stage colorectal cancer patients (Stage I-III) can inform the use of chemotherapy and/or targeted and immunotherapies. Additionally, the ability to detect such biomarkers non-invasively in the blood can facilitate earlier detection of colorectal cancer, thus enabling improved patient outcomes.\nStudy overview: Exome sequencing data were analyzed from 118 biopsies from 23 metastatic colorectal cancer patients with paired distant metastases to the liver or brain to delineate the timing and routes of metastasis and to define metastasis competent clones (Curtis et al., Quantitative evidence for early metastatic seeding in colorectal cancer. Nature Genetics, 2019)\nStage of Development\nValidation in human tissue samples.\n\nApplications: Early, non-invasive detection of colorectal cancer, Determination of treatment approach (i.e., use of chemotherapy/type of targeted therapy), Determination of risk of relapse following therapy or metastasis, Monitoring of minimal residual disease following treatment.\n\nAdvantages: Current lack of biomarkers for colorectal cancer patient stratification, Can be readily screened for, Can be used to define therapy and risk of metastasis."

However, the application of fiber optics to biomedical applications has been limited by the low biocompatibility of silica, the material used for fabricating classical glass optical fibers.\nIn this work, Stanford inventors have developed polysaccharide-based optical fibers that are biocompatible but also share many of the favorable characteristics of traditional silica fiber optic systems, like the ability to be repaired or connected after fabrication with fusion splicing methods. These optical fibers have a host of applications in medicine and bioscience ranging from biosensing of biotargets like viral antigens to photonics and optogenetics.

Stanford University,Anticipatory Steering Wheel Movement for Automated Vehicles,Docket #: S16-370,"Published Application: 20180222524, Issued: 10,259,496 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/anticipatory-steering-wheel-movement-automated-vehicles,"Researchers at Stanford have advanced the concept of an """"Anticipatory Control Interface"""" that informs the driver of a partially automated vehicle of its lateral trajectory plan. Partially automated vehicles that require supervision by a driver – and intervention in case of a failure – require the driver to be aware of the current action and, ideally, the future plans of the automated driving system. The researchers' innovation involves moving the steering wheel (or indicating such movement via visual pattern, e.g., a set of LEDs) in advance of the road wheels to inform the driver about the future plan of the automated driving system. Providing future steering information on the steering wheel in this way could empower the driver to recognize a mistake by automation and react to it faster, improving vehicle safety. Moreover, this approach may impose less visual processing on the part of the driver compared to other proposed systems requiring interpretation of visual information on a screen. Such a system may also improve driver trust in the vehicle, as vehicle steering actions are pre-cued and less likely to surprise. Many algorithms for road vehicle path planning allow calculation of the trajectory and the desired steering angle at a given (short) time in the future, assuming there is no sudden change in the environment, and are thus compatible with this invention.\nRelated Technology\nStanford docket 16-385 - describing an interface for controlling a vehicle during semi-autonomous driving by using the steering wheel to direct the vehicle under certain conditions, e.g., to make lane changes.\nStage of Development\nThe researchers report an evaluation of the Anticipatory Control Interface prototypes based on their ability to support driver recognition and response to automation failures, compared to a control condition.

By categorizing distinct genome-driven subsets of breast cancer, inventors were able to determine the rate, route, and location of tumor metastasis with utmost precision.  Currently, doctors rely on the size/grade of the tumor and the degree of lymph node spread but the exact course of the tumor is unknown especially after the patient was considered cured (after 5 yrs post diagnosis).  This leaves doctors with no full-proof way to plan careful clinical follow-ups--ultimately missing critical cancer recurrences.\nAfter following over 3000 women diagnosed with breast cancer (between 1977 and 2005), researchers discovered that certain molecular components of tumor tissue could be categorized into specific, distinct tumors which helped to provide a chronology of tumor metastasis.  More specifically, 25% of women categorized as estrogen receptor positive and HER2 negative have a 42-55% chance of late relapse within 20 years.  Further, researchers found that women with the aggressive and difficult to treat triple-negative breast cancers were able to be divided into defining subgroups.\nThis discovery allows practitioners to drastically improve upon clinical management and outcome by honing-in on targeted therapies and eventual drug delivery systems for millions of women with precision and confidence – solving a huge, unmet clinical need worldwide (please refer to list of applications and advantages).\nStage of Development:\nPrediction models have been verified and continued research will confirm the clinical, therapeutic, and diagnostic use, and possible drug therapies with both in vivo and in vitro data\n\nApplications: Targeted therapy– able to identify and direct clinical decision-making, Monitor high risk patients who need ongoing therapies, Adjust therapeutics -- use of chemotherapy and/or extended endocrine therapy, Identify genomic defects in tumor, then direct treatment, Drug development –drugs produced to directly cater towards specific tumors as inventors found specified gene targets.\n\nAdvantages: Unmet medical need –  Extreme accuracy in prediction of breast cancer late recurrence risk (5 yrs and up to 20 yrs from diagnosis), Compared to other commercially available multigene signatures, Identification of key factors, 25% of estrogen receptor positive and HER2 negative women have a 42-55% chance of late relapse within 20 years, Patterns of tumor metastasis: route, rate, and location in the body, Classification of breast cancers, 11 distinct diseases, For example, triple-negative breast cancer (known to have poor prognosis) has two different sub types with one that can be treated successfully, Huge, impactful reach – In the United States alone, according to the U.S. Breast Cancer Statistics, about 1 in 8 U.S. women (~ 12%) will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime."
Stanford University,Soft Collapsible Hydraulic Shock Absorber,Docket #: S19-367,"Issued: 12,013,010 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/soft-collapsible-hydraulic-shock-absorber,"Stanford inventors have developed a rechargeable, fluid-based shock absorber material for use in space constrained environments. Foam is the most common form of shock absorption material, but its force exerted is proportional to the degree of displacement. They are also singular in their ideal force profiles making them incapable of adapting to different impact speeds. In applications such as football helmets or automobile safety, this can lead to more damage than the initial impact itself. This design utilizes an incompressible liquid contained within a fabric vessel, which is ejected upon impact as the vessel collapses into an outer elastic refill chamber. As the compression force is removed, the fluid returns to the fabric vessel ready for the next impact. Notably, use of the incompressible fluid allows for the force exerted by the shock absorber to scale with the impact energy making this a versatile mechanism. In the case of personal protective equipment, the force profile can be tuned by adjusting pad size and liquid amount to provide a personalized fit.\nRelated technology:  S16-466 Ideal Damper for Concussion Protection\nPhoto description: Schematic of the shock absorber.

Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness world-wide, affecting millions of adults in the United States alone. The disease is characterized by the degeneration and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), a type of neuron that functions in transmitting visual signals from the retina to the optic nerve. Glaucoma is also characterized by functional changes in the astrocytes of the retina and optic nerve head (ONH), which function to support and protect RGCs. Current eyedrop treatments for glaucoma are aimed at reducing elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and slowing progression of the disease. Unfortunately, these treatments lose effectiveness at the later stages of the disease and fail to directly target the role retinal and ONH astrocytes play in glaucoma progression. This new methodology allows for highly specific targeting of viral vector gene therapies to retinal and ONH astrocytes, facilitating novel and desperately needed modalities for the treatment of glaucoma and other optic neuropathies.\n\nApplications: Targeted gene therapy delivery to retinal/optic nerve head astrocytes, Glaucoma, Optic neuropathies.\n\nAdvantages: No existing gene therapies for glaucoma and other optic neuropathies, No existing methods for targeting gene therapy to retinal/optic nerve head astrocytes."

Stanford University,TrueImage: Better Images for Telemedicine,Docket #: S21-262,Published Application: 20230107485,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/trueimage-better-images-telemedicine,"Stanford inventors have developed TrueImage, a machine learning algorithm to assess the quality of patient images sent in for telemedicine appointments.\nRemote care has become a key facet of healthcare in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and will likely continue into the future. Particularly in disciplines like dermatology where visual inspection is a key diagnostic tool, a persistent issue with telemedical care is that images photographed by patients are often not high enough quality to be clinically useful. The need to recapture these images before the remote consultation can occur wastes time and clinical resources.\nUsing machine learning, inventors at Stanford have developed a smart assist tool for patients that can analyze clinical images for quality and output a quality assessment that offers suggestions on how to improve the image with relation to blurriness, zoom, and lighting. In early studies, the tool rejects over 50% of poor quality images while retaining 80% of acceptable images. The software is designed to be integrated into existing healthcare technology platforms and is flexible in implementation, allowing this technology to benefit clinicians and patients broadly.\nStage of Development\nPrototype is complete and clinical trials are starting.\n\nApplications: Smart clinical image photography assist for adding on to telemedicine, digital health, or electronic health record technology platforms.\n\nAdvantages: Time and resource saver: Avoids patients needing to retake photos, conserving valuable consultation time, Flexible integration: Can interface with existing telemedicine or electronic health records platforms, Purpose-built: Developed with images from Stanford Dermatology to assess images specifically for the quality features that are key to clinical diagnosis."
Stanford University,Customized Load-Bearing and Bioactive Functionally-Graded Implant for Treatment of Osteonecrosis,Docket #: S15-027B,"Published Application: 20200315801, Issued: 11,666,445 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/customized-load-bearing-and-bioactive-functionally-graded-implant-treatment,"Stanford inventors have developed a functionally-graded implant device for the reconstitution of the necrotic area removed after surgical treatment of osteonecrosis of the hip.\nOsteonecrosis of the hip (ONH) is an increasingly prevalent and debilitating disease in which a lack of blood supply to the femoral head causes bone death, osteoarthritis, and eventual structural collapse, often progressing to require total hip replacement. While removal of the core necrotic area surgically can sometimes prevent collapse, it is only successful 20-70% of the time. Bone implants taken from the fibula to fill in the removed area can help but the harvesting process is painful. Metal implants also help prevent collapse but can result in pain for the patient and can complicate hip replacement later, should it become necessary.\nScientists at Stanford have invented a new implant that can replace the core of bone removed during surgical treatment of early stage ONH. The device is a mechanically robust functionally-graded scaffold (FGS) that acts as a filler for the tunnel of removed tissue in the femoral head. It is composed of three separate sections designed with the necessary mechanical support but also with the appropriate porosity to allow for vascularization and new bone ingrowth.\nStage of Development:\n\nApplications: Implant for replacement of the core decompression tunnel during surgical remediation of early-stage osteonecrosis of the hip to improve patient outcomes.\n\nAdvantages: Functionally-graded implant mimics properties of the surrounding tissue, allowing for new vascularization and bone ingrowth, Unlike metal or bone implants, material is permeable to vascular invasion and bone ingrowth, lessening patient pain, Implant can be 3D printed with novel biodegradable materials, allowing it to be personalized to each patient."
Stanford University,Direct Thermal Infrared Vision via Nanophotonic Detector Design,Docket #: S21-293,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/direct-thermal-infrared-vision-nanophotonic-detector-design,"Researchers at Stanford have designed a new nanophotonic detector to reduce cost, size and power consumption compared to existing thermal infrared (IR) cameras. Traditional IR cameras contain specifically designed IR detectors whose output is converted to digital signals followed by image processing and a final projection of the IR image on a separate display screen. The new nanophotonic design eliminates the need for analog to digital conversion, image processing and a separate display device, thus considerably simplifying the overall architecture. Potential products based on this functionality include a small-size eye-wearable that can allow direct thermal IR vision to human eyes. Such a technological capability does not currently exist. In this architecture, the array of detector pixels is illuminated by visible laser light. The detectors are designed such that the amount of reflection of the laser light depends on the temperature change in the pixel relative to the substrate induced by IR radiation focused onto it. In other words, the IR image of the far-field scene can be directly seen by looking at the detector array (also called as focal plane array) through a magnifying lens. This new, minimalist approach can considerably simplify an uncooled infrared camera.\nThe proposed architecture is schematically shown in comparison to the standard thermal IR imaging system. Seen in the red dotted lines are system parts eliminated in the new minimalist design (image credit: the inventors)\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Similar to IR cameras, relevant applications requiring infrared images include:, Detection and sensing in industrial (gas/chemical leakage), agricultural (crop qualities), infrastructure (building, bridge inspection), healthcare (thermograms), Night-vision or low-light vision applications for military, fire-fighters, camping-enthusiasts.\n\nAdvantages: Existing thermal infrared cameras are typically bulky and costly, New approach potentially cuts cost, form factor and power consumption by eliminating conventional system components."
Stanford University,High flux anaerobic membrane bioreactor,Docket #: S21-202,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/high-flux-anaerobic-membrane-bioreactor,"Stanford researchers in the Criddle lab have developed a novel anaerobic membrane bioreactor that enables high flux treatment of wastewater with greatly reduced energy costs. The most common current approaches to wastewater treatment utilize aerobic processes, including aerobic membrane bioreactors. These types of bioreactors require energy-intensive aeration to supply oxygen for the aerobic bacteria they utilize and produce high amounts of biosolids, requiring further processing or disposal, that imposes additional costs. Wastewater aeration requirements account for ~1-2% of US electricity consumption, and biosolids provoke ~13% of the operational expenditure of aerobic domestic water treatment plants. Anaerobic membrane bioreactors, which utilize methane-producing anaerobic microorganisms, promise a potential solution to these quandaries. Unfortunately, conventional anaerobic membrane bioreactors are not able to treat some particles in wastewater, provoking rapid membrane fouling, subsequently limiting high flux operation, and resulting in poor effluent quality. The new anaerobic membrane bioreactor design, incorporating optimized membranes, can improve energy efficiency by enabling high flux operation and increased methane production while producing better effluent quality.\nFigure:\n\nApplications: Municipal wastewater treatment, Industrial wastewater treatment, Food and Beverage water treatment.\n\nAdvantages: High flux, High energy savings\n\nNet-energy positive operation in pilot-scale bioreactor, Net-energy positive operation in pilot-scale bioreactor."
Stanford University,Novel NR1 ES-derived neural stem cell therapy for restoration of neurologic function following ischemic stroke,Docket #: S20-101,"Published Application: WO2022081452, Published Application: 20230405054",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/novel-nr1-es-derived-neural-stem-cell-therapy-restoration-neurologic-function-following,"To date, there are no treatments to restore neurologic function for the 7 million US patients suffering from chronic ischemic stroke. NR1 therapy provides a novel treatment for this unmet need. Unlike the cells used in the SanBio and ReNeuron clinical stroke trials, which are genetically manipulated with the theoretic potential to form tumors, NR1 cells are not genetically altered. NR1 cells are the only allogeneic, non-genetically modified human neural stem cell intended for chronic stroke treatment, providing them with limitless manufacturing potential.\nThe Steinberg Lab at Stanford developed an NR1-based therapy to derive neural stems cells that can recover neurologic function following ischemic  stroke. The treatment can be delivered intracerebrally into the area surrounding the chronic stroke. The secreted factors from the NR1 cells improve neurologic function by enhancing multiple native (molecular, cellular and circuit) mechanisms including modulation of the immune system, neovascularization and improving the excitatory/inhibitory balance of neural networks. Contrary to initial notions, they do not work through integration and cell replacement of neurons, astrocytes oligodendrocytes or other cells in the brain. The invention is currently undergoing Phase I/II clinical trials to demonstrate their clinical efficacy. Additionally, the therapy offers long viability after thawing compared to existing cellular therapies and already has a robust, scalable cGMP manufacturing process.\nStage of Development\nPhase I/II Clinical Trial\n\nApplications: Treatment of ischemic stroke, Treatment of traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury, Treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, Neurological stem cell therapy.\n\nAdvantages: Only allogeneic, non-genetically modified human neural stem cell therapy method, Longer viability after thawing than existing cellular therapies, Robust, scalable cGMP manufacturing process."

Cancer, a disease of unregulated cell division, is one of the leading causes of death world-wide and new targeted treatment options would be invaluable tools in combating the disease. The HAT1 holoenzyme complex is involved in the replication-dependent assembly of chromatin through the stimulation of histone protein synthesis and the acetylation of those newly synthesized histone proteins. Recent research by the inventors has demonstrated that these functions of the HAT1 holoenzyme complex are intertwined with the nutrient-sensing that regulates cell division. Additionally, they discovered that HAT1 expression is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, and that many cancers exhibit frequent mutations in the HAT1 holoenzyme complex. This novel platform enables high-throughput screening, with flexible readouts, for the discovery of therapeutic modulators of cancer-specific mutant HAT1 holoenzyme complexes.\n\nApplications: Cancer therapeutic discovery, Therapeutics targeting cancer-specific mutant HAT1 holoenzyme complex.\n\nAdvantages: Novel modality, High specificity, Flexible assay readout."

For both lung cancer and lung fibrosis, mortality rates are high while sufficient therapies are still not available. Immunotherapy represents a promising treatment methodology, but even with the current slate of immunotherapies in the clinic, survival rates for lung cancer patients remain too low.\nHere, scientists in Dr. Gerlinde Wernig's lab demonstrate that blocking a new immune target upregulated in lung cancer and fibrotic lung tissue increases phagocytosis and increases the efficiency of the innate immune system to eliminate cancer cells and diseased fibroblasts. Blocking this new target represents a novel immunotherapeutic method that targets the innate immune system and a """"don't-eat-me"""" signal for the treatment of lung cancer and fibrotic lung diseases.\n\nApplications: Treatment of of lung cancer, with the potential to treat other cancers as well, Treatment of lung fibrosis.\n\nAdvantages: Novel target for immunotherapeutic treatment of cancer and other diseases, Much like CD47 antibodies, method targets """"don't-eat-me"""" signal to increase phagocytosis by the innate immune system instead of targeting the adaptive immune system like many existing therapies."

Currently, these cells are labelled, frozen or otherwise manipulated in ways that prevent sequential testing against multiple drugs on the same few cells. To address this issue, Stanford researchers have developed a plasmonic liquid Raman spectroscopy platform for rapid drug screening. The liquid chamber works with plasma, serum, whole blood, and sputum allowing for real-time monitoring. Without the need for labeling, researchers monitor cellular behavior of few to single cells for drug susceptibility using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Aside from real-time single drug testing, this platform can also accommodate sequential drug testing on samples like cancer cells to evaluate combination therapies. In all, this SERS platform drastically reduces cost, time and volume of sample required, enabling it for more diverse settings and situations.\nStage of Research\n\nApplications: Drug susceptibility testing: cancer treatment, antibiotics, combination therapies, Liquid biopsy: monitoring disease progression to select and optimize treatment from plasma, serum or whole-blood, Drug development & repurposing, Research involving cell-cell communication & interactions during and post treatment.\n\nAdvantages: Rapid, real-time interrogation of cells, Non-destructive, cells remain live and intact, Label-free assay, Few to single cell required, Multi testing on same cell: various drugs or environmental influences."

However, X-rays are ionizing radiation that are dangerous for the patient and the physicians performing the procedure. To reduce or eliminate the need for X-rays, an  impedance sensor is embedded just proximal to the tip of the angiography catheter. The sensor detects impedance changes in injected embolic or contrast material, allowing embolization to be monitored without reliance on X-rays. This closed loop control system will sense reflux and automatically reduce injection rate, eliminating off-target embolization, preserving the health of adjacent organs.\nStage of Development\n\nApplications: Diagnostic angiography, Specifically, monitoring of embolic/contrast material delivery through angiography catheters.\n\nAdvantages: Decreased radiation required during angiography and embolization procedures, leading to enhanced safety for patient and physician, Safer embolization procedures with less risk of off-target embolization, Closed loop control system to sense reflux and automatically reduce injection rate, Potential ability to target more tumors if less radiation is required for each tumor, Potentially, in the future, the impedance sensor could be used for navigation of the catheter to target organs."
Stanford University,Laser patterned stretchable electronics,Docket #: S18-163,Published Application: 20220095963,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/laser-patterned-stretchable-electronics,"Stanford researchers have developed a fabrication method for laser patterning stretchable electronics.

Stanford University,Fully Miscible Antifoam Formulations,Docket #: S21-171,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/fully-miscible-antifoam-formulations,"Chemical engineers at Stanford have developed miscible antifoams that are easy to incorporate and do not separate out from the target liquid during operation. With a market cap of $3.2 billion, antifoams (or defoamers) are additives used across industries to control deleterious foaming in liquids such as lubricants and diesel fuels. Usually, antifoams take the form of dispersed particles or immiscible droplets, which are difficult to incorporate and susceptible to separation from the liquid during operation. Once the antifoams separate from the liquid they are effectively useless, leading to unwanted foaming. Unlike existing products, which break up foams through either spreading or bridging-dewetting mechanisms, the new antifoams use a different physical mechanism - species concentration-induced surface tension gradients (also called Marangoni flows). This different physical mechanism makes fully miscible antifoams possible. When mixed into a target liquid, the miscible antifoam, through its relatively higher volatility, leads to surface tension gradients that cause bubble rupture up to 10 times faster than the target liquid without the antifoam.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept. The researchers are engineering more variants that can be used for a wider range of lubricants and diesels.\n\nApplications: Lubricant and diesel antifoam/additive manufactures such as Lubrizol and Momentive., Useful as a lubricant or as a diesel antifoam/additive.\n\nAdvantages: Ease of incorporation., Does not separate out from the target liquid, Ruptures bubbles up to 10x faster than the target liquid without the antifoam."

Mast cells are a part of the innate and adaptive immune response. Mast Cell activation results in release of granules containing tryptases. When this response is over-activated, it results in Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), the cause of severe allergic reactions. Due to this association, a therapeutic strategy to attenuate allergic reactions via inhibition of tryptase activity has been proposed. Researchers at Stanford University have identified a compound, Avoralstat, as an inhibitor of tryptase activity. This compound was clinically proven to be safe in its phase III clinical trials for hereditary angioedema, and there is evidence in in vitro biochemical studies to suggest its candidacy for treatment of severe allergic reactions.\n\nApplications: Therapeutic treatment for severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and food allergy.\n\nAdvantages: Safety of Avoralstat has been tested to be safe in phase III clinical trials."

Normal and healthy cells display the cell-surface protein CD47 that serves as a 'don't eat me' signal through interaction with signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) receptors on phagocytes of the immune system. This signaling is a key component to the specificity of the immune system's clearance of aged, damaged, and dying cells. Pathogens across the tree of life have evolved proteins that mimic CD47 to similarly suppress phagocytes from consuming them, enhancing their ability to establish persistent infections. Characterizing potential CD47 mimics in diverse pathogens remains a challenge as they can often not be identified through sequence-similarity searches. This engineered protein can not only block the function of pathogen CD47 mimics to reduce infections and improve protective innate immune responses, but also be employed as a probe for the discovery of unknown CD47 mimics.\n\nApplications: Infectious diseases, Bacterial Infection, Lyme Disease, Fungal Infection, Aspergillosis, CD47 mimic target discovery.\n\nAdvantages: No current therapeutics that target pathogen CD47 mimics, High specificity, High affinity, Unknown pathogen CD47 mimic discovery tool."

Sometimes the cell product is no longer detectable in the peripheral blood, due to potential exhaustion or lack of engraftment. Additionally, most T cells become exhausted when they cannot properly differentiate into effector memory T cells, thereby disrupting their persistence in the body. Current approaches to address this issue have been limited, as they rely on restarting from different T cell progenitors instead of trying to manipulate the underlying molecular pathways that are involved in T cell memory.\nInventors at Stanford have developed a method to show how modulating certain transcription factors can improve adaptive immunity. They demonstrated that memory T cells highly express the BHLHE40 transcription factor and modulating the expression of BHLHE40 can lead to the development of novel cancer immunotherapies. Through modulation of BHLHE40 transcription factor, the Roncarolo Lab was able to decrease the frequency of T cells becoming exhausted. BHLHE40 is required for efficient expression of cytokines including: IFNg, IL4, and IL-2. Knocking out BHLHE40 in human naive CD4+ T cells leads to an increase in IL-10 production but does not have a significant effect in IL10 production when knocked out in total CD4+ T cells.\nBy inhibiting a transcription factor (e.g. through genetic manipulation), the invention can be used to prevent the differentiation of a subset of cells and skew the differentiation into another subset of cells. By identifying the transcription factors involved in the differentiation, cells can more easily differentiate in vitro and in vivo and be leveraged for the development of novel immunotherapies.\n\nApplications: Cell manufacturing by upregulating transcription factors during the production of CAR-T cells or in vivo post infusion., Cell control and targeting, Immunotherapy and CAR-T cell therapy.\n\nAdvantages: Targets underlying molecular pathways involved in T-cell memory instead of T-cell progenitors, Reduces cell manufacturing time, Increases Tr1 cell yield."

This method has now been adapted for simple, fast, and inexpensive whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2.  The researchers have shown that the entire SARS-COV-2 genome can be captured in a streamlined PCR-based assay with a total run time of about 24 hours. More below.\nRUSPseq was first developed to improve screening for inborn metabolic disorders as it reduces the number of false positives and enables early detection and management of life-changing genetic diseases. Newborn screening is performed to detect metabolic disorders that could cause debilitating disease in children but may have better clinical outcomes with early detection and treatment. Methods have been developed to detect more than 40 metabolic disorders on the Recommended Universal Screening Panel (RUSP) from newborn dried blood spots (DBS). These methods, while beneficial, suffer from high false positive rates and thus a second round of more specific testing is often required to rule out false positives. This can cause significant emotional and financial burden.

Stanford University,Bioluminescent assay for rapid and sensitive screening of bacterial beta-lactamase activity,Docket #: S21-142,"Published Application: WO2022245975, Published Application: 20240229098",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/bioluminescent-assay-rapid-and-sensitive-screening-bacterial-beta-lactamase-activity,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed a rapid and sensitive bioluminescent assay for screening bacterial infections using enzyme-produced photo emission for detection of beta lactamase activity. ß-lactam antibiotics are the most successful class of antibiotics, however there is growing resistance due to in part by inappropriate antibiotic treatment regimens that encompass a broad spectrum of antibiotics. Bacteria containing ß -lactamase enzymes such as extended-spectrum ß -lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC-type ß -lactamases (ACBLs) and carbapenemases (CARBs) hydrolyze ß -lactam antibiotics rendering them ineffective. Rapid and accurate detection of ß -lactamase activity would allow for targeted treatment of bacterial infection. Current detection methods take 2-3 days to generate results in clinical laboratories and genotypic testing while rapid, tend to generate false-positive results. These limitations are addressed in a reliable and fast bioluminescent ß-lactamase detection assay invented by researchers at Stanford University. They have improved upon their first-generation bioluminescent probe (BLUCO) for detecting ß-lactamase activity in Gram-negative bacteria. Their bioluminescence detection assay uses enzyme-produced photon emission which confers the advantage of low background and a rapid assay time of 15 minutes. This technology could be implemented into an in vitro diagnostic test for rapid assaying of ß -lactamase activity in patient samples for guided treatment of infectious diseases.\n\nApplications: In vitro diagnostic agent for assaying beta-lactamase activity in patient samples to guide antibiotic treatment.\n\nAdvantages: 15-minute ß -lactamase detection assay, Sensitive, low background detection of ß -lactamase activity."

For the purpose, ex vivo multiplexed biopsy platforms have been developed to simultaneously analyze more than 20 biomarkers within the same tumor tissue after surgical resection. On the other hand, in vivo multiplexed imaging, which has been proposed for noninvasive monitoring of multiple biomarkers in living subjects, is still in its infancy owing to the limited number of multiplex channels. The Gamhbir lab at Stanford have pioneered Raman imaging and has invented the first ever preclinical non-invasive and highly multiplexed imaging method for the imaging of nanoparticle-targeting tumors in living subjects. Using near-infrared (NIR)-resonant surface-enhanced Raman scattering (NIR-SERRS) nanoparticles, the inventors performed noninvasive imaging of living mice whose tumors were targeted with these nanoparticles. The NIR-SERRS nanoparticles provided both high multiplicity originating from narrow spectral width of Raman spectra, and strong Raman scattering signals with comparable brightness to traditional NIR fluorescence. The in vivo 5-plex imaging enables noninvasive tracking of the 5-color nanoparticles in tumors, which is not feasible with currently available ex vivo multiplexing platforms, demonstrating great potential for noninvasive assessment of multiple biological targets within the tumor microenvironment. The invention provides a novel, non-invasive method that allows longitudinal monitoring of multiple tumor biomarkers.\n\nApplications: -Molecular monitoring (e.g. tracking biomarkers and tumors), -Tissue imaging, -Multiplex imaging.\n\nAdvantages: -Noninvasive multiplexing method enabling longitudinal tumor monitoring, -higher sensitivity for imaging compared to traditional NIR-fluorescence, -Higher multiplicity to extended imaging channels."
Stanford University,Electrolysis Cell for Generating Concentrated Liquid and Gas Product Streams from CO or CO2,Docket #: S18-314,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/electrolysis-cell-generating-concentrated-liquid-and-gas-product-streams-co-or-co2,"Stanford researchers in the Kanan group have developed a electrolysis cell for generating and extracting liquid and gas product streams from CO and CO2. Previous designs for electrosynthesis of C2+ products from CO or CO2 suffer from dilute product streams due to low reactant concentration and mixed phase products. Reduction of CO to C2+ products complicates matters by producing mixed phase products: gaseous ethylene or liquid products (acetic acid, ethanol, propanol etc). To overcome this challenge, this cell utilizes interdigitated flow fields, combined with gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) and a Nafion membrane to simultaneously attain high current density, high selectivity and high single pass conversion (68%) of CO reduction at moderate cell voltages (100 mA cm-2). Specifically, the Nafion membrane transports concentrated liquid products away from the GDE and is easily isolated from product gas streams (as high as 1.1M sodium acetate). Overall this design improves efficiency of water/ion flux to an electrode to extract concentrated product streams with potential for scaled up synthesis and expansion to CO2 electrolysis.\nPhoto description: Cell configuration and schematic of charge flow.

Stanford University,Reversal of Tumor-Induced CAR-T cell and CD8+ T-cell Exhaustion with Annexin V,Docket #: S18-395,"Published Application: WO2022212352, Published Application: 20240293505",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/reversal-tumor-induced-car-t-cell-and-cd8-t-cell-exhaustion-annexin-v,"Researchers at Stanford University have discovered an invention to reverse tumor-induced CAR-T cell and CD8+ T cell exhaustion with administration of annexin V. The application of CAR-T cell anti-cancer therapy for treatment of hematologic cancers have been successful, however the tumor microenvironment (TME) surrounding solid tumors exhibit an immunosuppressive effect that directly inhibits CAR-T cell function. An important component of the immunosuppressive TME is phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization causing anti-tumor immunity including arrest of T-cell signaling within cytotoxic CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. This essentially blocks immune signaling and inactivates CAR-T CD8+ lymphocytes.  Stanford researchers have found that exogenous administration of annexin V, which binds to PS with high affinity, masks the highly immunosuppressive effects of externalized PS found in the TME. Furthermore, the combination of tumor specific CAR-T cell therapy with continuous administration of annexin V over several weeks' reverses tumor induced CAR-T cell exhaustion, a novel invention that has the potential to make CAR-T therapy a viable treatment for solid tumors.\n\nApplications: Administration of combination CAR-T cell therapy with annexin V for the treatment of solid tumors, Continuous systemic or local infusion of annexin V at doses of 2 to 2.5 mg/kg/day for 2 to 4 weeks based on animal model work is well tolerated.\n\nAdvantages: Annexin V is a human protein with nanomolar affinity for PS, CAR-T cell therapy has been ineffective in treating solid tumors, combination therapy with annexin V could make it a viable treatment option."

Imitation learning is an AI process of learning by observing an expert, and has been recognized as a powerful approach for sequential decision-making, with diverse applications like healthcare, autonomous driving and complex game playing. However, conventional imitation learning methodologies often utilize behavioral cloning, which has advantages of simplicity and stability, but fails to recognize any information involving an environment's dynamics. Conventional methods that do exploit dynamics information tend to be difficult to train in practice due to an adversarial optimization process over reward and policy approximators. To address these deficiencies, the researchers have introduced a method for dynamics-aware learning which avoids adversarial training by learning a single Q-function, implicitly representing both reward and policy. Inverse soft-Q learning (IQ-Learn) obtains state-of-the-art results in offline and online imitation learning settings, surpassing existing methods both in the number of required environment interactions and scalability in high-dimensional spaces.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: AI and robotics, Autonomous driving.\n\nAdvantages: Unlike previous methods, the approach converge in a small number of steps recovering the optimal reward and agent policy, Uses simple optimization and is easy to train, Scales to high-dimensional inputs like images, enabling human-like gameplay on video games using video demonstrations of humans/experts, State-of-the-art in imitating experts without requiring interactions with a simulator or the real world, enabling learning just from passive observations of experts, Works with visual expert demonstrations of car driving or robotic simulation environments, successfully imitating the experts and reaching their level of performance, Recovers learned rewards that show a high positive correlation with the ground-truth environment rewards, leading to the interpretability of learned behavior."

For background, Hall-effect sensors are used to measure magnetic fields in a variety of applications, including electricity generation at power stations, electric motors, and power electronics. The diversity of applications has driven significant research in this area. But conventional Hall-effect devices are fundamentally limited by current spinning. Prior work by the inventors represented a major innovation in Hall-effect sensing, but the harmonic signal driving the device had to match exactly the frequency of the external magnetic field. The novelty of the new method is that it does not require frequencies to have an exact match. It leverages the AC Hall-effect to characterize a magnetic field at an unknown frequency (or frequencies). The resulting measurement of magnetic field spectral components is phase-independent and requires no prior knowledge of exact magnetic field frequency.\nStage of Development\nThe researchers have experimentally shown offset voltage values between 8 and 27 ?T at frequencies ranging from 100 Hz to 1 kHz, verifying the potential of their technique in both cases.\n\nApplications: Measuring AC magnetic fields, Car manufacturing, Power transformers and high power electricity lines, OEMs.\n\nAdvantages: Can measure magnetic field at any frequency without current spinning, Does not require matching frequencies, Reduces components, overall cost and size of device, Preserves accuracy and precision, Produces no induced voltage and results in a low offset."

The COVID-19 pandemic was a grave demonstration of the threat pandemics pose to global public health. Rapid development of vaccines is critical for the prevention and control of such pandemics. As part of this goal, adjuvants are key components of vaccines that can potentially increase the strength, durability, and breadth of the immune response. Unfortunately, the mechanisms that determine how adjuvants work are, in many cases, poorly understood.

Despite high response rates to therapy, most patients will ultimately have disease progression after CAR19 T-cell therapy. Identifying patients who will have favorable outcomes, versus unfavorable outcomes, after CAR19 T-cell therapies, remains a critical challenge. Inventors at Stanford developed a method to utilize cell-free DNA from the blood plasma of a patient to track DNA from both the tumor and the CAR T-cells themselves.

However, the repaired area after the graft exhibits fibrotic healing, which results in fragility, lack of flexibility, and scar contracture. Groups at Stanford and elsewhere have demonstrated that mechanotransduction pathways are involved in scarring and fibrosis and that Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) proteins are key signaling components in these pathways.\nIn this work, Stanford scientists test the principle that FAK inhibition is an effective strategy for reducing wound scarring and fibrosis using a previously validated and selective FAK inhibitor called VS-6062. They combine split thickness skin grafting with the application of collagen-pullulan hydrogels containing this FAK inhibitor and show in a porcine model that the addition of the inhibitor-containing hydrogel accelerates wound healing, reduces scarring, and blocks scar contracture as compared to hydrogels alone. The promising results of this straightforward method in a large animal model indicate a technology that is ripe for  clinical trials and commercialization.\n\nApplications: Scar reduction, improved wound healing, and reduced wound contracture after skin graft repair of burn wounds or related soft-tissue defects.\n\nAdvantages: Improved function: Less wound contracture and greater flexibility of the skin around joints improves movement as compared to the standard-of-care skin graft alone, Improved appearance: Less scarring than with grafting alone leads to improved aesthetic result for patients, increasing their quality of life, IND-stage therapy: Promising results in porcine models and an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA in preparation indicate an advanced therapeutic product ready to move into patients soon."

Stanford University,Perfect color routers for solid state image sensors,Docket #: S20-402,"Published Application: WO2022094453, Published Application: 20230417960",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/perfect-color-routers-solid-state-image-sensors,"Image sensors are used across the board in high-resolution image sensing technologies, and critically rely on their ability to separate colors of light. Current commercial standards utilize color filters, which absorb unwanted wavelengths to filter and transmit only the desired color to the photodetector of the corresponding color channel, , e.g., red (R), green (G), blue (B). Although effective, this design is very inefficient and captures only a small fraction of light at the detector (less than 20-25% for a color filter array with a typical 2 by 2 pixel RGGB Bayer kernel), which makes low light imaging challenging and limits the practical size of image sensor pixels. The Fan group has designed a color router based on lossless materials that cleanly routes all incident light based on its spectral content (colors) with perfect (~ 100%) photon efficiency to the proper photodetector for all color channels. This results in a 4-5 times increase in the number of photons at the pixel photodetector level compared to a color filter-based approach. This color router design allows further scaling of image sensor pixels to sub-wavelength sizes ( 400 nm) since no light is reflected  or absorbed. The underlying design principles can be applied to any desired wavelength of light and dielectric materials, allowing this technology to push the performance and size in color-separating devices to the absolute limit.\nPhoto description: a) Diagram of a typical color filter (CF) setup (ML = microlens) and b) diagram of a color router setup.

Stanford University,Optimized Quantum Transduction for Long-Distance Quantum Communication,Docket #: S20-514,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/optimized-quantum-transduction-long-distance-quantum-communication,"Researchers at Stanford have developed an approach to dramatically improve the efficiency of microwave-to-optical quantum transduction – a significant step towards realizing efficient communication between distant superconducting quantum systems. While superconducting quantum circuits are a promising platform for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computation in the near future, these circuits operate at microwave frequencies. Thus direct quantum communication between distant systems is precluded by the high propagation loss of microwave photons over commercial microwave cables. Efficient, coherent, and noise-free transduction of single photons from microwave to optical frequencies (and vice versa) is necessary to achieve coupling of distant superconducting quantum systems over optical fibers and, eventually, networking and distributed quantum computing. Ensembles of quantum emitters that can couple to both microwave and optical modes can be utilized to construct such single photon transducers. The new approach is built upon the insight that the temporal shape of the laser pulse that drives the quantum emitters and supplies the energy required for transduction can be experimentally tuned and poses the design of the driving laser pulse as an optimization problem to be solved by numerical optimization techniques.\nStage of Development\nThe researchers have demonstrated that their technique can compensate for the detrimental effects of inhomogeneous broadening in quantum emitter ensembles to help realize more efficient transducers.\n\nApplications: Design of more efficient quantum emitter ensemble-based microwave-to-optical quantum transducers.\n\nAdvantages: Order of magnitude improvement in transduction efficiencies, Step towards scalable, distributed quantum computing."

This scalable innovation, with ~2x reduced reset power and reset current density, could be a promising route for high density data storage applications. While PCM technology has already been adopted in commercial products as a promising storage-class memory, high switching current density and switching power remain key challenges, including in emerging applications such as neuromorphic and in-memory computing. The Stanford technology leverages a substantial, positive thermoelectric coefficient in PCM materials to generate additional heating at an interface with another material, enabling memory switching with a large reduction in current and power. Interfacial thermoelectric engineering is applied to a PCM cell using a class of thermoelectric materials with negative thermoelectric coefficient (e.g., bismuth telluride, Bi2Te3) to induce efficient heating at lower power and current. Other thermoelectric materials with large negative thermoelectric coefficient (e.g., PbTe, La3Te4, InSe, Si0.8Ge0.2) could also be used instead, and these could be further optimized by changing their composition, deposition, and thickness.\nStage of Development\nThe researchers have demonstrated their PCM technology leverages thermoelectric heating at the PCM interface to provide a ~2x reduction in the reset current density and power at a similar voltage.\n\nApplications: High density data storage.\n\nAdvantages: Reduction of switching current density and switching power is a critical problem facing the industry, Innovative yet simple and scalable, ~2x less power and reset current density compared to control PCM devices, Enhanced thermoelectric heating with reduced reset power."

Stanford University,Prediction of gestational age using urine metabolites,Docket #: S19-384,"Published Application: WO2022099320, Published Application: 20230288398",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/prediction-gestational-age-using-urine-metabolites,"Stanford scientists have invented a method that can determine the gestational age of a fetus by testing the mother's urine for a set of metabolites.\nPrecise determination of gestational age is key to accurate tracking of a variety of other fetal and maternal health indicators. However, without an ultrasound examination from a medical professional, there is currently no accurate way to determine fetal age. Given this limitation, an alternative and more accessible method for accurately determining the gestational age is necessary, especially for women in either poorly-resourced communities or remote locations to have trouble getting access to an ultrasound exam.\nWith this innovation, Stanford inventors have developed such an alternate method. Using metabolomics methods to analyze urine samples of 99 pregnant women, they have identified a handful of key metabolites in the mother's urine which are able to accurately predict the gestational age of the fetus.

However, methods like using the time from last menstruation can be inaccurate while ultrasound methods require the patient be examined by a trained medical professional to assess gestational age. A technique to determine the gestational age that is both accurate and easy would be a valuable option for many patients.\nWith this invention, Stanford scientists have developed a new paradigm in gestational age prediction. Using cutting-edge metabolomics profiling and machine learning to analyze samples from 339 normal pregnant women in Denmark, they have developed a method to determine gestational age from an untargeted metabolomic profile of the mother's urine.

Stanford University,Improved Methods for Modeling Multi-Contact Robotic Interactions,Docket #: S20-314,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/improved-methods-modeling-multi-contact-robotic-interactions,"Researchers at the Stanford Robotics Lab have developed new methods for modeling multi-contact collisions and steady physical interactions between multiple rigid bodies. This work is needed because simulation of robotic manipulators in contact-driven tasks require stable and smooth estimates of contact forces. Current polygon-mesh methods lead to jitter and computational inefficiency in determining contact forces and the resulting motion of objects. The new, geometric-composition approach addresses these limitations to generate smooth contact forces in computer simulations. Using a common contact frame rather than multiple points, and using primitive shapes (e.g., cones, spheres) as approximations for complex organic shapes, the approach reduces computational time and complexity.

Stanford University,Deep Learning for In Vivo Near-Infrared Imaging,Docket #: S20-378,Issued: 12039723 (USA),https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/deep-learning-vivo-near-infrared-imaging,"Near-infrared (NIR) imaging is a valuable research tool that produces quality images with high spatial and temporal resolution through millimeter tissue depths. Imaging at the NIR-IIb window (1500 – 1700 nm) is the most effective one-photon approach to suppressing light scattering and maximizing imaging penetration depth. Unfortunately, toxic nanoparticle probes must be used to capture images in the NIR-IIb window. Biocompatible fluorescent probes can be used at a lower wavelength at NIR-I (700 – 1000 nm) or NIR-IIa (1000-1300 nm); however, light scattering occurs at shorter wavelengths and results in suboptimal imaging. Inventors in the Dai lab at Stanford trained artificial neural networks to transform a fluorescence image in the shorter wavelength NIR window of 900-1300 nm to a high-resolution image resembling a NIR-IIb image. With deep-learning translation, in vivo lymph node imaging achieved unprecedented signal-to-background ratio, while enhancing tumor-to-normal tissue ratio to improve tumor margin localization.

However, their widespread application is hampered by distance between the robot and its operator which results in communication delays. To address this issue, Stanford researchers have developed a system to perform remote haptic control of robots even in the presence of large communication delays. While existing systems quickly become dangerous and unstable when delays reach ~100 milliseconds, this approach that leverages robot local autonomy is robust to delays longer than 1 second. The method consists in separating the control between the operator and robot into three components. Two local controllers on the operator and robot side that maintain a degree of autonomy, and a dual-proxy model that connects them and acts as a smart communication bridge by generating safe and consistent inputs to the local controllers. Finally, a perception algorithm allows the robot to detect its environment geometry in real time. This informs the parameters set in the dual proxy model to enable fully autonomous implementation of the system. This system is applicable to any remote robotic operation regardless of distance and communication delay.\nPhoto description: Dual proxy model for local autonomy-based haptic interaction.

Stanford University,"An orally, bioavailable, and non-toxic salt to induce DNA demethylation and overcome retinoic acid-resistance in neuroblastoma",Docket #: S20-426,"Published Application: 20220175704, Issued: 11,918,550 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/orally-bioavailable-and-non-toxic-salt-induce-dna-demethylation-and-overcome-retinoic,"Dysregulated DNA methylation is associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients, promoting tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) reduce DNA methylation and promote cancer cell differentiation in in vitro and in vivo models, with two DNMTi approved for cancer treatment. However, DNMTi have several major clinical limitations: they only prevent formation of new methylation marks rather than remove existing methylation; they promote demethylation through 'dilution' of methylation through cell division; they also target normal cells, causing toxicity; and they are weak mutagens incorporating into DNA. The Ye lab at Stanford has developed an effective metabolic intervention to achieve global DNA demethylation by leveraging niclosamide ethanolamine (NEN). NEN is a cell-permeable, orally bioavailable, and non-toxic salt that acts as a reversible and mild uncoupler of mitochondria. The inventors demonstrated NEN treatment increases ?-ketoglutarate (?KG), a substrate of TET DNA demethylase, reduces global DNA methylation and induces tumor suppressor gene and differentiation marker gene expression in neuroblastoma cells. Importantly, NEN not only increases ?KG under normoxic conditions, but also reduces 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), an inhibitor of TET DNA demethylase under hypoxic conditions, suggesting that NEN may be an effective strategy to promote differentiation and inhibit tumor growth in hypoxic tumors.  Neuroblastoma (NB) is a cancer of the sympathetic nervous system, which accounts for 7% of all childhood cancers and 15% of childhood cancer-related deaths. In high-risk patients, disease relapse occurs frequently after surgery or chemotherapy and eventually becomes fatal. For over 15 years, the main treatment for NB utilizes retinoic acids (RA), chemicals derived from vitamin A, to induce differentiation in neuroblastoma cells. However, about 50% of neuroblastoma patients who initially respond to RA therapy develop RA-resistance. One of the major causes of RA-resistance is due to the epigenetic silencing of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) signaling through DNA methylation. The inventors demonstrated that NEN treatment restored RAR signaling, overcoming RA-resistance. In addition to neuroblastoma, the inventors demonstrated that NEN also shows anticancer effects in cell lines from multiple cancer types including ovarian, lung, and other cancers. As the first successful application of NEN for RA-resistance, the invention has the potential to be used as a prescribed medicine for cancer treatment and overcoming resistance in neuroblastoma.\nStage of Development:\n\nApplications: DNA-based therapeutics, Oncological treatment, Research tool for metabolic disorders.\n\nAdvantages: Nontoxic and biocompatible agent, Can be used in vivo or in vitro, Induces differentiation through epigenetic reprogramming, Efficient reduction of global DNA methylation within an hour."

However, key issues remain, including the risk of phage-resistant mutations arising in bacteria and a tendency for phage to precipitate out of solution.\nThe inventors have developed a phage therapy formulation that overcomes these challenges using annexin V, an enzymatically inert human protein that has already been tested in clinical trials. Annexin V binds to the negatively charged bacteriophage coat, stabilizing phage preparations of up to 1012 plaque forming units per milliliter (pfu/ml), instead of the standard 107 to 108 pfu/ml. These highly concentrated preparations potentially allow direct phage lysis, which would speed up treatment and therefore reduce the chance of resistance mutations.\nStage of Development\nIn vitro/in vivo. The formulation rapidly resolves otherwise-lethal Pseudomonas aeruginosa wound infection in mice.\n\nApplications: Stabilized, highly concentrated phage and annexin V preparations for:, Antibacterial phage therapy, Radiolabeled studies of bacterial infection biodistribution.\n\nAdvantages: More concentrated phage potentially facilitates:, Direct phage lysis, also known as """"lysis from without"""", Faster treatment, Reduced chance of resistance mutations, Less frequent phage precipitation, Easier shipment and long-term storage."
Stanford University,Advanced precursor for selective atomic layer deposition of Al2O3,Docket #: S20-277,Published Application: 20220136106,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/advanced-precursor-selective-atomic-layer-deposition-al2o3,"Selective atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a critical component of advanced manufacturing and offers an alternative to lithographic procedures. Traditional precursors such as AlCl3 or AlCl2 CH3 are used for Al2O3, but these precursors show poor are selectivity with increased deposition cycles. These smaller precursors more easily penetrate the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) used to pattern the silicon surface, and bind to the surface creating nucleation sites for growth during subsequent cycles. Purging the chamber can prevent this problem, but adds time and cost to the manufacturing process. Here Stanford researchers utilized a new ALD precursor, Al(CH3)3 which shows >98% selectivity over 75 cycles. This bulkier precursor has reduced reactivity and is unable to penetrate the SAMs, leading to increased selectivity. Overall, Al(CH3)3 is an improved precursor for selective ALD and offers a template for design other precursors used in selective ALD.\nPhoto description: Selectivity of ALD precursors as a function of cycles.

Stanford University,"Methods, Compositions, and Kits for Assessing Endometrial Transformation",Docket #: S19-249,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/methods-compositions-and-kits-assessing-endometrial-transformation,"Researchers at Stanford and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub have developed a transcriptomic characterization of human endometrium and identified specific gene signatures for use in evaluating endometrial samples for one or more menstrual cycle events.\nIn a human menstrual cycle, the endometrium undergoes remodeling, shedding and regeneration, all of which are driven by substantial gene expression changes. Traditionally, a cycle can be divided into two major phases by the event of ovulation: the proliferative (preovulatory) and the secretory (postovulatory). During the secretory phase, the endometrium enters a narrow window of implantation (WOI) that is both structurally and biochemically ideal for embryo implantation. Remarkably, and given its relevance to human fertility and regenerative biology, our molecular understanding of endometrial transformation has been rudimentary.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors present a high-resolution molecular and cellular characterization of human endometrial transformation across the natural human menstrual cycle. The authors use single-cell RNA sequencing to study both the static and dynamic aspects of endometrial tissue to provide single-cell transcriptomic delineation of endometrial transformation. Cell-type-specific gene expression analysis, including a previously uncharacterized ciliated epithelial cell type, identified biomarkers that can be used to evaluate, assess, or otherwise probe endometrial samples from a subject to detect one or more menstrual cycle events, such as the WOI.\nStage of Development\nResearch – in vitro\n\nApplications: Transcriptomic assessment of various endometrial cells throughout the menstrual cycle, Practical or clinical application of the identified gene signature panels to detect a particular menstrual cycle event of a subject (e.g., follicular phase, ovulation, luteal phase, or WOI), such as treatment and/or management of patients, including those in need of assisted reproduction.\n\nAdvantages: Biological samples can contain multiple endometrial cell types, or cells can be separated before gene signature analysis, Transcriptomic analysis and biomarker identification was performed in human subjects with no influence from exogenous hormones or gynecologic pathology."
Stanford University,Emotion Regulation Questionnaire,Docket #: S14-020,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/emotion-regulation-questionnaire,"A researcher at Stanford has developed a questionnaire to assess individual differences in emotion regulation. Individuals differ in their use of emotion regulation strategies such as reappraisal and suppression, and these individual differences have implications for affect, well-being, and social relationships. The questionnaire measures two specific forms of emotion regulation. The researcher derived the ERQ items rationally, indicating clearly in each item the emotion regulatory process to be measured, such as """"I control my emotions by changing the way I think about the situation I'm in"""" (reappraisal) and """"I control my emotions by not expressing them"""" (suppression). The Reappraisal and Suppression scales both include at least one item asking about regulating negative emotion (illustrated for the participants by giving sadness and anger as examples) and one item about regulating positive emotion (exemplified by joy and amusement). Care was taken to limit the item content to the intended emotion regulatory strategy, and to avoid any potential confounding by mentioning any positive or negative consequences for affect, social functioning, or well-being.\nStage of Development\nFive studies tested two general hypotheses: individuals differ in their use of emotion regulation strategies and these individual differences have wide ranging implications. See publication link below.\n\nApplications: Individual difference assessment, Mental health and well-being.\n\nAdvantages: Measures two specific forms of emotion regulation."
Stanford University,iPSC-derived cardiac fibroblasts for in vitro modeling of cardiac fibrosis,Docket #: S19-280,"Published Application: WO2020264308, Published Application: 20220348877",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/ipsc-derived-cardiac-fibroblasts-vitro-modeling-cardiac-fibrosis,"Fibroblasts are known to be a source of the numerous pathologies associated with fibrotic diseases. However, drug development targeting the cell type has been impaired by poor in vitro models, where primary human fibroblasts are difficult to culture and expand, and murine models have limited translational value. This is particularly problematic for cellular models of cardiac fibrosis, where activated myofibroblasts can easily contaminate stem cell-derived cultures of quiescent cardiac fibroblasts.\nInventors at Stanford's Joseph Wu lab have developed a differentiation program for cardiac fibroblasts using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), offering a valuable tool for drug and target screening in cardiac diseases. The differentiated fibroblasts maintain a quiescent phenotype to enable mechanistic evaluation of cardiac fibrosis, and the inventors have used the platform to identify a novel fibrotic pathway impacting heart tissue.\nThe differentiation platform represents an unlimited source of cardiac fibroblasts that closely resemble primary human tissue genetically, morphologically, and functionally, and enables mechanistic exploration of pro- and anti-fibrotic pathways for drug and target discovery in cardiac diseases.\n\nApplications: Disease model for cardiac diseases, including\n\nMyocardial infarction\nCardiomyopathy\nHeath failure, Myocardial infarction, Cardiomyopathy, Heath failure, Evaluation of pro- and anti-fibrotic pathways impacting cardiac tissue, Adaptable to patient-specific cardiac fibroblasts.\n\nAdvantages: Unlike existing iPSC-based differentiation protocols, results in limited production of smooth muscle cells, pericytes, or activated myofibroblasts, Preservation of quiescent properties, High cell uniformity and purity, iPSC platform enables patient-specific drug and toxicity testing, Amenable to co-culturing."
Stanford University,Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) therapy with growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15),Docket #: S20-427,"Published Application: WO2022125548, Published Application: 20240000891",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/proliferative-vitreoretinopathy-pvr-therapy-growth-and-differentiation-factor-15-gdf15,"Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is a rare ocular condition that can lead to vision loss or blindness and is a complication of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, severe diabetic retinopathy, and other conditions. Usually treated with complex retinal reattachment surgery, the prognosis for long-term anatomic or functional success is poor. To address the lack of PVR treatment, the inventors focused on targeting Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), which is involved in PVR progression and growth. Differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) was shown to suppress EMT, working as a potential therapeutic agent for PVR, and protecting retinal neurons from death. Researchers in the Goldberg lab at Stanford developed a nonsurgical treatment for PVR by leveraging GDF15 as a EMT inhibitor. After intravitreal injection, GDF15 prevented fibrosis and scarring from EMT in mice, effectively reducing the onset and progression of PVR. Compared to existing strategies, the invented method directly suppresses the EMT pathway and provides a novel ocular therapeutic for PVR.\n\nApplications: -Ocular therapies, -Wound regenerative therapies, -Therapies for somatic tissues and diseases.\n\nAdvantages: -Nonsurgical treatment, -Reduces fibrosis and scarring from EMT, effectively blocking the onset and progression of PVR, -Directly suppresses EMT and protects retinal neurons."
Stanford University,Clinical transrectal imaging system for detection of prostate cancer using dual ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging,Docket #: S20-251,"Issued: 11,854,124 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/clinical-transrectal-imaging-system-detection-prostate-cancer-using-dual-ultrasound-and,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed a clinical transrectal imaging system for detection of prostate cancer using dual ultrasound and real-time photoacoustic imaging. The standard-of-care for prostate cancer diagnosis is performing a transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy which provides images of the tissue structure but lacks the molecular information to accurately distinguish between benign or malignant prostate tissue. To improve the accuracy of prostate cancer diagnosis researchers have developed a new dual imaging system which combines ultrasound imaging for anatomical data and photoacoustic imaging for molecular information based on light absorption. In addition, they have developed an algorithm, SPANNER, which utilizes reconstruction techniques to provide photoacoustic images in real-time while mitigating the effects of limited viewing angles and low signal-to-noise. This combined system is able to achieve high contrast between exogenous and endogenous factors such as blood oxygenation and hemoglobin content, providing useful information to help guide physicians as they take biopsy samples or perform guided surgery. This technology can be used in place of the standard transrectal ultrasound system, with the added function of photoacoustic imaging, making it an exciting technology for companies in the transrectal ultrasound field.\n\nApplications: Real-time clinical transrectal dual imaging for prostate cancer diagnosis.\n\nAdvantages: Integrated photoacoustic method achieves high contrast of endogenous and exogenous factors such as blood oxygenation and hemoglobin content, Can be used in place of a standard transrectal ultrasound device with added function of photoacoustic imaging, SPANNER software reconstructs photoacoustic image in the presence of limited view and low signal-to-noise."

Such an advance could lead to improved performance across a wide array of systems in terms of size, weight, and power. Currently, electro-optic modulators are widely used in communications, sensing, and computing, among other fields. However, the sensitivity and power requirement of these detectors fall short of what is predicted possible. The new approach envisions an electro-optic modulator that uses 'squeezed' states of light to boost sensitivity. Squeezed states of light have been used to significantly improve measurements in the gravitational wave laser interferometer LIGO, but have yet to find wider use. Integrating a scaled down squeezed state generator and electro-optic sensor on the same chip enables a vastly more robust realization of a quantum sensor that could achieve a significant 10-100x enhancement in sensitivity over current classical technology. This work could lead to new types of sensors out of reach of classical technologies.\nStage of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: Receiving antennas (esp. phased arrays) widely used in communications, radar and passive imaging, Quantum transducers.\n\nAdvantages: Increased sensitivity and low noise, Size/weight/power improvements, Enables sensors that may be worn or mounted on lightweight platforms (space or autonomous), Could eliminate need for electronic amplifiers."
Stanford University,The Vortex Shunt – A Novel Prenatal Lower Urinary Tract Obstruction (LUTO) Vesico-Amniotic Shunt (VAS),Docket #: S21-017,Published Application: WO2022173865,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/vortex-shunt-novel-prenatal-lower-urinary-tract-obstruction-luto-vesico-amniotic-shunt,"Physicians at Stanford Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH) have developed a novel Vesico-Amniotic Shunt (VAS) for treatment of Prenatal Lower Urinary Tract Obstruction (LUTO). LUTO is a birth defect in which the fetus has a blockage in the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the amniotic sac. If left untreated, this condition renders a mortality rate of up to 80%. LUTO affects 1 in 5,000 -25,000 pregnancies and has limited treatment options available: (1) Fetal cystoscopy, a technically difficult procedure to remove the obstruction is associated with fetal injury and maternal morbidity (2) Placement of a VAS, a catheter connecting the fetal bladder to the amniotic sac facilitates decompression, however in 80% of cases kinking or dislodgment occurs (commonly multiple times in one pregnancy) requiring additional surgical intervention(s). While the two currently available shunts have potential for improved fetal survival, their double pigtailed design has high risks for intraoperative and postoperative shunt complications. To address current LUTO treatment limitations, inventors at LPCH have invented the vortex shunt consisting of a (1) Nitinol inner coil for dynamic adjustability/kink resistance (2) Nitinol braided fixation elements to provide robust fixation to the fetal bladder and amniotic sac (3) A one-way duckbill valve to allow bladder cycling (4) Echogenic visualization to aid ultrasound detection and (5) Controlled 6Fr delivery system that allows repositioning and recapture of shunt.  The vortex shunt is an innovative product that aims to vastly improve outcomes for LUTO patients and has the potential to be applied to other conditions requiring a shunt such as in cases of hydrocephalus and pulmonary effusions.\n\nApplications: LUTO VAS treatment, Treatment of pleural effusions as alternative to chest tubes, Hydrocephalus treatment, Hemodialysis treatment.\n\nAdvantages: Improvement in shunt deployment by echogenic double braided fixation elements, Decreased chance of dislodgment over time - Vortex dislodgement force was 21X greater than the Harrison shunt and 2.5 X greater than the Rocket shunt, Less likely to kink as the fetus grows, Novel shunt valve allows for bladder cycling preserving function, Decreased need for multiple in-utero procedures leads to decreased preterm membrane rupture and decreased preterm birth."

Neoantigens generate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and CTLs can be exploited to safely target and eliminate cancerous cells. Two major challenges in adoptive T-cell immunotherapy are the insufficient recognition of cancer antigens due to mutations and the exhaustion of T lymphocytes. Inventors in the Nakauchi Lab identified antigenic epitopes specific to mutations found on RAS and EGFR in lung, colon, and pancreatic cancer. Leveraging their patented T-cell rejuvenation technology, the inventors use these newly identified neoantigens to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Additionally, the generated T-cells can be redifferentiated via the neoantigen specific T-cells. To date, very few mutations have been identified as neoantigens within RAS and EGFR. As mutations in RAS and EGFR are common across cancers, the same CTLs generated can be used to treat multiple types of cancers. The invention provides a novel platform for develop effective adoptive immunotherapeutics.\n\nApplications: Adoptive immunotherapy, Stem cell research and therapeutics, T cells and iPSCs research.\n\nAdvantages: Same CTL can be used to treat multiple cancers, One of the few neoantigens that have been identified across RAS and EGFR, Effective, safe, and targeted immunotherapy."

The C-GAN learns the underlying distribution of solutions found by an optimization algorithm, then generates further optimized solutions. Adversarial training enables the C-GAN model to learn the distribution of solutions and to generate more optimized solutions in a shorter time than that needed to run the original optimization algorithm. This regression-based method yields solutions with desired labels rather than a random set of optimization solutions. This method is specifically effective in augmenting heuristic optimization algorithms, which get stuck at local solutions, for solving high-dimensional and complex mathematical optimizations.\nPhoto description: Overview of the proposed algorithm for using a C-GAN to complement an optimization algorithm on a high-dimensional nonlinear optimization.

Single cell analysis methods have traditionally been limited to sequence-based biomolecule quantification (e.g., gene expression analysis via RNA-Seq). There are few technologies that can link sequence-based biomolecule quantification to phenotypic characterization (e.g., cell morphology acquired via dynamic cellular imaging). Notably, these current methods are limited in throughput and/or the number of phenotypic parameters that can be reliably measured without significantly increasing run costs.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a single cell analysis technology for making tandem sequence-based nucleic acid measurements and phenotypic measurements at population scale by harnessing spectrally encoded microbeads. Their system allows for the direct correlation of functional or phenotypic analyses of single cells with sequencing-based measurements by means of microbeads with a 1:1 linkage of lanthanide spectral signature and an identifier sequence attached to the bead.

This technology is based on the discovery by Prof. Philip Beachy and colleagues that Sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein expression is lost in invasive bladder tumors. Furthermore, because Shh usually activates the BMP pathway in the bladder lining, external agents that artificially activate BMP signaling can prevent tumor invasion and growth. This therapeutic strategy could help curtail progression of early stage bladder cancer and prevent the invasive form that is expensive to treat and largely incurable. This method may also prove useful for other cancers that are impacted by BMP pathway activity.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have demonstrated that low dose FK506 (tacrolimus) treatment protected mice from invasive bladder cancer.\n\nApplications: Cancer therapy - treatment for bladder and other epithelial-derived cancer (such as lung, pancreas, colon, breast or skin cancer) using agents that activate BMP, Drug repositioning - using existing BMP activators such as FK506 for cancer indications.\n\nAdvantages: Known safety profile:, existing BMP activators (such as FK506) have been approved by the FDA for use in humans, low-dose treatment with FK506 can activate the BMP pathway with minimal immunosuppression, Reduced treatment costs - treatment with BMP could have significant impact on clinical management of bladder cancer due to the high rate of recurrence and progression that necessitates ongoing monitoring."

Stanford University,Method to improve effectiveness of gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy,Docket #: S15-007,"Published Application: 20170021000, Issued: 10,543,260 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/method-improve-effectiveness-gene-therapy-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed a method to induce antigen-specific immunological tolerance to allow for more effective gene replacement therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).  DMD is a fatal, inherited, x-linked recessive disorder that affects 1 out of 3,600 males. Due to a defect in the dystrophin gene, there is progressive muscle wasting leading to skeletal muscle loss, and late stage cardiac and respiratory failure.  With no known cure, tremendous efforts have been made towards gene therapy approaches. The goal for adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene replacement therapy in DMD is to achieve persistent transgene expression of dystrophin at therapeutic levels. However, an unfortunate side effect of gene therapy is an aggressive immune response to the introduced gene and AAV vector.  This immune response severely limits the effectiveness of gene replacement therapy.  Thus, there is an urgent need to find treatments with limited side effects.  To help meet this need, the inventors have developed methods of suppressing the immune response to DMD gene replacement therapies.  They have developed a tolerizing vaccine that can be used as an add-on to DMD gene replacement therapy to reduce the immune response and restore effectiveness of the therapy.  The investigators also reduced immunity to the AAV vector. This technology helps overcome the limitations of gene therapy and provides the potential for more effective treatment of DMD.\nStage of research\nUsing the mdx/mTR mouse model of DMD, the inventors have shown their microdystrophin tolerizing vaccine can effectively reduce the immune responses against microdystrophin and against AAV, and thereby help to restore the effectiveness of microdystrophin gene replacement therapy.\n\nApplications: Gene therapy for DMD- add on to improve the effectiveness of gene replacement therapy.\n\nAdvantages: Reduces unwanted immune response that limits the effectiveness of gene therapy, Add on to gene replacement therapies, Focused approach- induces immunological tolerance to DMD gene therapy without further affecting the adaptive immune system, The gene used in the tolerizing vaccine can be modified to match that used in the gene replacement therapy, The tolerizing vaccine can also be generated to reduce the immune response to the AAV vector."

The Stanford OPA serpentine architecture (figure 1) is based on two group index matched slow light waveguides, which eliminates large phase-shifting elements, but maintains the ability to set phase relation and thereby steer the beam.  This OPA architecture steers in two directions with a high antenna density, small operating bandwidth, and a large sweep angle making it attractive for LiDAR and other optical systems.\nFigure 1 Matched slow light waveguide serpentine OPA architecture (Image courtesy the Vuckovic Group)\nStage of Development – Proof of Concept\n\nApplications: LiDAR, Photonics, Projection systems, Microscopy.\n\nAdvantages: Robust, stable, less expensive, and fast, Small operating bandwidth, 2D steering, Improved accuracy - larger scanning cone through a higher packing density."

Currently, to replicate the kind of pressure intrinsic to many forms of social touch such as hugging, existing wearable haptic displays use light weight pneumatic pouches that can embed into things like jackets and vests, and often rely on force feedback. However, exerting the proper pressure over the appropriate contact area remains challenging to render. As such, existing single-pouch designs are inadequate for emerging opportunities in areas like robot teleoperation and virtual/augmented reality. To better meet these needs, the Stanford team has implemented a new macro-mini actuation approach using stacked pouches. This design strategy offers improved control, coverage of large areas, fast dynamic response, and higher spatial resolutions.\nWatch a short video\nStage of Development\nThe researchers have demonstrated the pneumatic macro-mini approach using a huggable robot embedded with distributed force sensors.

X-ray crystallography, NMR and more recently cryo-EM have made breakthroughs in solving high-resolution structures of macromolecules, however visualization of proteins smaller than 40 kDa at high resolution has proven difficult with the structural biology techniques available today. To break the resolution limit, researchers have invented a double shell protein scaffold which sandwiches the protein of interest with an interior and exterior protein shell via fusion. This cage-like structure consists of an inner shell comprised of 24 copies of apoferritin, forming a rigid shell that can be readily identified in cryo-EM images. The outer shell, made of maltose-binding protein (MBP), is more flexible, allowing access for small molecule or peptide compounds to enter the interstitial space and bind the target of interest. This technique has proven successful in solving the structure of the 11kDa KIX domain of the CREB-binding protein (CBP) at 3-4 Å. End to end implementation of the double-shell technology can be commercialized, from designing the DNA plasmid, to expression and purification of the caged protein, to cryo-EM structure determination. Additionally, high-resolution structure determination of small flexible therapeutic protein targets can enable structure-based drug design not previously possible.\n\nApplications: High-resolution structure determination of flexible proteins smaller than 40 kDa, Structure based drug design of therapeutics for flexible small protein targets, Commercialization of double-shell technology via DNA plasmid design, expression and purification of caged protein and cryo-EM determination.\n\nAdvantages: Structure determination of proteins smaller than 40kDa, System can be used with or without ligands."

Stanford University,EMERGENCY USE VENTILATOR,Docket #: S20-166,Published Application: WO2021195466,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/emergency-use-ventilator,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a low-cost and rapidly scalable emergency use ventilator for the COVID-19 crisis.\nThe high incidence of COVID-19-related respiratory failure has exposed critical shortages in the supply of mechanical ventilators. Mechanical ventilators, devices that facilitate both oxygenation and ventilation, must reliably deliver a specific volume of gas in a specific time interval. Mechanical ventilators traditionally rely on an internal compressor and mixer to moderate and control the positive-pressure gas mixture delivered to a patient. However, the current COVID-19 pandemic has spurred alternative designs of """"emergency response"""" ventilators to help address the increased demand.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a ventilator, designed in accordance with the Emergency Use guidance provided by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), that can be used to support patients when the demand for ventilators exceeds hospital supplies. Their device is based on a continuous flow design, wherein an external premixed gas supply (oxygen/air) feeds into the ventilator and time-limited flow interruption guarantees tidal volume. The device is designed to control flow through valve timings, enabling both non-invasive care and invasive care (i.e., assisted and mandatory) modes of ventilation. For invasive ventilation modes, the ventilator relies on a pressure-limited-time-cycled breathing loop, and a tidal volume is set by allowing a known flowrate of gas to flow for a specified time. The inventors demonstrate the effectiveness of the device in providing consistent and reliable oxygen delivery during a live animal experiment.\n\nApplications: Single ventilator platform, capable of supporting the various treatment paradigms during a potential COVID-19-related hospitalization, or other emergency uses.\n\nAdvantages: One-device-one-visit solution that is sufficiently robust to accompany a patient through all respiratory aspects of COVID-19 treatment, Rapid and high-volume manufacturing due to small number of associated parts, Constant pressure monitoring to detect leaks or obstructions that could risk patient or device safety, Spirometer-based expiratory volume sensor in exhalation circuit to measure exhaled volumes and assist in determining patient volume calculations and settings."

There is an unmet clinical need for high-quality predictive tests for PE early in gestation (16 weeks) to guide prophylactic use of potential therapeutics and improve obstetric care. Liquid biopsies that measure circulating, cell-free RNA (cfRNA) offer the ability to noninvasively study the development of pregnancy-related complications, like preeclampsia.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed a method of diagnosing or evaluating risk of preeclampsia by quantifying levels of cfRNA from a biological sample in a pregnant subject. To develop this method, the inventors conducted a prospective clinical study to identify a predictive signature of transcriptomic changes across gestation. Specifically, the inventors isolated and analyzed cfRNA to identify a panel of differentially expressed genes that segregate PE and control samples across gestation, agree with known PE biology, and together provide a risk score for PE.\n\nApplications: High-quality predictive tests for PE early in gestation ( 16 weeks), applicable as early as 5 weeks, Risk score can provide diagnostic and prognostic insight into risk of developing disease, or to assist in the selection of therapeutic intervention or disease management approaches.\n\nAdvantages: Small subset of differentially expressed genes can predict PE risk before 16 weeks of gestation with high specificity and sensitivity, and can differentiate PE from other pregnancy-related complications, Method separated PE and normal samples across gestation with good specificity, despite differences in symptom severity, PE onset subtype and gestational age at delivery, Gene expression can be easily measured using RT-PCR (or other common methods of gene expression detection), which is a clinically relevant and inexpensive alternative to RNAseq, cfRNA can be isolated from the non-cellular fraction of a bodily fluid (e.g., blood serum or plasma)."

Transplantation of hPSC-derived cell populations into preclinical models has generated teratomas (tumors arising from undifferentiated hPSCs), unwanted tissues, and other types of adverse events. Thus, it is essential to ensure that all cells have been sufficiently differentiated prior to engraftment. However, it is impossible to ensure that protocols have successfully differentiated 100% of cells. Toward this end, the Porteus Lab engineered a general platform to improve the safety of future hPSC-derived cell transplantation therapies. Using genome editing via a combined CRISPR/AAV6 method, they developed hPSC lines with two drug-inducible safeguards. Clinically relevant small molecules can then selectively activate the respective safeguards to initiate cell-specific apoptosis, removing unwanted differentiated cells (via the NANOG-linked switch) or all cells in the case of an adverse event (via the ACTB-linked switch). These safe-guards provide orthogonal safety switches to address major safety concerns with pluripotent cell-derived therapies.\nFigure caption: Safeguards engineered within hPSC lines to prevent teratoma formation and eliminate unwanted cell-types\n\nApplications: -Stem cell and tissue models, -Cell therapy, -Tissue engineering.\n\nAdvantages: -Eliminates residual pluripotent cells following differentiation, -Controlled regulation of stem cell cultures, -Simple integration via gene editing technologies."

This method addresses those challenges by first identifying semiconducting materials with high-brightness, then selects those which are air-stable. High-brightness is evaluated by calculating the intrinsic emittance: lower intrinsic emittance leads to higher brightness when used as a photocathode. The software was able to identify 11 novel materials, with some displaying brightness 16x larger than current state-of the art materials.A machine learning algorithm then aids in the discovery of air stable materials in order to eliminate the need for ultra-high vacuum environments.

Their innovation, called Graph Diffusion Transformer (GDT), advances the state of the art for completion of knowledge graphs, namely node classification and link prediction, and can be applied widely, e.g., medical knowledge graphs. Transformer architecture introduced the notion of self-attention (allowing the model to direct its focus and pay attention to different parts of the input) which leads to high performance in many natural language processing tasks.

Regions of tumor outside the radiation field do not experience direct radiation-induced DNA damage and cellular apoptosis. Thus, there is a need for a robust off-target (abscopal) effect of radiation. Stanford inventors have combined radiotherapy with antibodies to develop a novel method of inducing abscopal responses for unirradiated tumors. The technique uses radiotherapy in combination with a CD47 blocking agent, which blocks don't-eat-me signals on cancer cells and activates the host's macrophages. Leveraging the strong inflammatory reaction produced by radiation enables repurposing of radiation-induced macrophages to exert an antitumor effect. Successful in vivo studies within small animals demonstrated the effectiveness of the method in enhancing the effects of radiation at the irradiated site but also in inducing abscopal responses, both in immunodeficient and immunocompetent hosts. A combined radiation and anti-CD47 treatment will be a valuable tool within chemotherapy to target off-target tumors, all by leveraging the host's own immune system.\n\nApplications: Chemotherapy, Immunotherapy, Radiation therapy.\n\nAdvantages: Targets irradiated tumors, High success in inducing abscopal response compared to previous clinical studies, Does not require a functional immune system and successful within immunodeficient and immunocompetent hosts."

These issues are typically treated surgically, but the issues have a higher incidence rate in developing nations where the patients can't afford surgery and there are few doctors with the requisite experience. Palate plates can also be used for treatment (like a more robust retainer) to help guide the growth of the developing palate, lower jaw, and tongue, which minimizes the need for surgery. However, such a treatment requires significant effort and skill from the orthodontist to develop these plates repeatedly to accommodate the facial growth of infants since the plate needs to be worn for several months to complete the treatment. This procedure requires obtaining new oral imprints and adjusting the plates under wake nasopharyngoscopy periodically.\nThe invention addresses these needs with the split palatal plate system using simple expansion screw design that can enlarge the plate precisely and quickly without repeating intraoral imprints and plate adjustments. The invention further enables fabrication of a serious of custom palatal plates to accomodate the baby's facial growth via pre-treatment intraoral scan, face CT scans, and/or face MRI scans, utilizing 3D printing technology. 3D printing technology with automatic detection of size and dimensions of the pharyngeal component will be able to eliminate the need of the expansion screw because a series of plates can be printed in gradually larger sizes. This way, this treatment can reach infants in remote locations with no easy access to the treatment.\nFigure description -  example of how a Split Orthodontic Airway Plate (S-OAP) can be enlarged when the plate needs to get bigger to accommodate the baby's facial growth. the OAP is split in half, the expansion screw is turned a few times to enlarge the palatal plate, then the gap is filled up using splint acrylic.

Location-aware services are an important emerging technology for mobile devices.  Determining location outdoors is easy with existing technologies like GPS.  Indoor localization is more difficult.\nThe WiFi SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) algorithm efficiently solves the indoor localization problem by using already-existing WiFi beacons to localize a mobile device.  While competing methods for WiFi localization exist, this technology offers significant improvements.  Specifically, it provides easy, low-cost map creation -- a single user can create a map just by walking around arbitrarily.  It also provides highly reliable localization.

Stanford University,Methods for Treating Protein Aggregation-Associated Diseases,Docket #: S18-526,Published Application: WO2020180938,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/methods-treating-protein-aggregation-associated-diseases,"Researchers at Stanford have found that nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) and the apical domain of CCT1, as well as peptide fragments and fusion proteins containing them, can be used to suppress pathological protein aggregation. This discovery is potentially useful for treating diseases associated with polyglutamine (polyQ) aggregation such as Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia, Alzheimer's disease, associated with amyloid protein aggregation, and Parkinson's disease, associated with alpha-synuclein. Late-onset neurodegenerative disorders are caused by the accumulation of toxic protein aggregation species directly responsible for neuronal dysfunction and death. As a defense mechanism against these toxic species, the cell deploys molecular chaperones which normally bind misfolded and non-native proteins and facilitate their folding or degradation. Recent evidence highlights the therapeutic importance of enhancing or replacing this protein folding machinery as it becomes over-burdened or less effective during the aging process.\nStage of Development\nThe researchers have shown that elevated levels of the full length CCT1 subunit suppress neurotoxicity associated with Huntington's disease in yeast model systems and tissue culture cells. In a system with purified components, ApiCCT1 (the 140 amino acid apical domain of CCT1) specifically and efficiently inhibits polyQ aggregation of huntingtin exon1. With attachment of the bNAC N-terminal sequence, the fused protein works even more potently to inhibit huntingtin exon1 aggregation, as it can suppress aggregation even at sub-molar ratios.\n\nApplications: Treatment of aggregation-associated diseases including Huntington's disease, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) or Kennedy's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), and amyloid beta aggregation-associated diseases such as Alzheimer's disease..\n\nAdvantages: This novel approach provides a robust avenue for therapeutic applications with several advantages over existing methods:, Highly specific targeting, Minimal off-target effects on cellular protein folding machinery, ApiCCT1 along with its modified form ApiCCT1-bNAC are both small and stable polypeptides, Versatile scaffold for the design of optimized aggregation inhibitors beyond Huntington's disease."

They have not only demonstrated this protein's key role in seed biology in Arabidopsis thaliana, but they have also discovered several methods, including regulation and mutation of the gene, that allow scientists to control the timing of seed germination and improve seed longevity.\nSeeds can lay dormant until the environmental conditions are right to begin growing into a plant, a process called germination. This process has long been a mystery to scientists as it was not known how seeds sense their environment to trigger germination. By studying the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, scientists at Stanford have discovered a key player responsible for controlling seed germination they termed FLOE1. They determined that FLOE1's unique biochemical structure gives it the ability to sense water and discovered several FLOE1 mutations that can either speed or slow germination depending on the desired result. Simply overexpressing the protein also increases seed viability overall. This protein has homologs throughout the plant kingdom and the researchers also show that, biochemically, these homologs behave similarly to Arabidopsis FLOE1, an exciting prospect for increasing seed viability and streamlining seed germination in crop species.\n\nApplications: Control seed germination rates in crops under normal conditions, Control seed germination rates in crops under water stress, a condition increasingly likely with climate change, Improve seed viability.\n\nAdvantages: Novel plant molecular biology: This technology represents one of the first ever opportunities for molecular control over seed germination and seed longevity, Non-GMO control possible: The inventors believe they can use this approach without the need to invoke GMO-regulated technology in crops, Robust germination control: Potential to speed seed germination up to 20X where desired or slow to wait for improved conditions, Improved seed bank viability: One simple method can potentially improve the viability of a new or existing seed bank crops."

These are the most ubiquitous types of laser-based 3D printing systems and do not require high vacuum or specialized optics. This process will enable 3D printing of high purity copper and other metal structures using laser-based metal 3D printing systems. Currently, state of the art metal 3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is limited to a small library of printable metals (e.g., stainless steel, Ti alloys, etc). There is a demand for the ability to reliably print high purity copper, silver, gold and platinum for thermal and electrical conductivity applications. Conventionally, these materials are difficult to 3D print due to their high laser reflectivity (low absorption) during the printing process.

Given that there is no current way to degrade and recycle lignin on a large scale, these strains could change the way lignin is processed and convert it into a valuable source of chemicals.\nLignin is a major component of woody biomass but is so difficult to chemically degrade that the vast majority of it is burned as waste each year. If there was an efficient way to chemically process lignin, it could be a renewable source of valuable chemicals. To solve this problem, researchers have developed mutant yeast strains that produce fungal enzymes that efficiently degrade lignin. These strains express enzymes called heme peroxidases that naturally come from fungi that can degrade lignin. Although yeast strains expressing these enzymes were previously engineered, scientists were unable to produce large amounts of the desired enzyme.\nSolving the problem of poor enzyme production, researchers at Stanford discovered that deleting two yeast genes called pmt2 and cyt2 leads to a 300-fold improvement in enzyme secretion. This technology is not only useful for one type of heme peroxidase, but for three different classes of enzymes, demonstrating that these yeast strains could be applied to production of a variety of enzymes. In addition, yeast is a commonly used organism in industrial applications, making efficient scale-up of this process a viable prospect. In a time when maximizing our use of renewable resources is of paramount importance, this technology could change the way wood is processed and recycled.\nStage of Development: Prototype\n\nApplications: Large-scale production of fungal lignin-degrading peroxidase enzymes., Enzymatic decomposition of lignocellulosic biomass into valuable chemical products., Improvement of saccharification yield in lignocellulosic biomass treatment., Research and scientific analysis of fungal lignin-modifying enzymes..\n\nAdvantages: Recycles a renewable resource that is otherwise discarded and burned, Mutant yeast strains have a 300-fold increase in levels of secreted enzyme compared to wildtype yeast strains, Easy to scale production of enzyme for industrial applications, Yeast is a commonly used organism for enzyme production; infrastructure currently exists to accommodate this technology."

The Solgaard lab microscope design uses a grating light valve (GLV) to scan the focus of a gaussian beam, creating a thin light sheet with the linear phased array acting as a varifocal cylindrical lens (Figure 1).  During the scan the narrowest region of the beam (the line focus) is synchronized with the center of a rolling camera shutter that captures the image.  The camera only captures the image from the narrowest part of the beam, thereby significantly increases axial resolution. The design includes a high-speed phase modulator, so the beam scan maintain pace with the camera (the system is camera limited), and isotropic resolution is possible with a narrow focus.  This light sheet microscope maintains real-time, volumetric imaging capabilities beyond current state of the art.\nFig. 1 (Inverted image) Light sheet nominal focus with the phased array off (left) and uniformly illuminated light sheet (right) with synchronization of rolling shutter and beam focus as designed.\nFig. 2   Drosophila embryo 3D images showing the surface of the reconstructed 3D volumes with rolling shutter widths of 1625 (top) and 65 ?m (bottom), respectively.\nStage of Development – Proof of Concept Prototype\nResearchers in the Solgaard Lab built and tested the axial scanning light sheet microscope.

For each cell in a 48-cell array, the OED algorithm analyses data from the first 100 cycles to predict the cell lifetime. Once there is enough data to predict with sufficient confidence, the OED determines the next cycling parameters for an individual cell and sends them to the potentiostat before repeating the process. As the 48 cells are tests in parallel, what is typically a 560-day process to evaluate 224 charging protocols only takes 16 days. This technology applies to fast charging, formation protocols, and state-of-health monitoring for overall lower development cost and time.\nStage of Research\n\nApplications: Battery design optimization, Example processes: fast charging, formation cycling, state-of-health monitoring.\n\nAdvantages: Accelerates battery development times by up to two orders of magnitude, Algorithm determines testing parameters and duration without the need for manual optimization."

Battery capacitance degrades non-linearly, which also makes predicting the number of cycles required to reach a specific percentage of remaining capacity difficult. Here, researchers have developed a data-driven model for predicting battery cycle life that only requires early-cycle input data. Most batteries do not exhibit capacity degradation within the first 100 cycles, yet this machine learning model only requires that initial data to accurately predict cell lifetimes. By extracting features from high-rate discharge curves, they were able to produce a test error of 9.1% using the initial 100 cycles, and an error of 4.9% if only data from the first 5 cycles are used. This machine learning model complements other semi-empirical models and without the need for long-term performance inputs, drastically reduces development time.\nStage of Research\n\nApplications: Battery lifetime prediction: cycles until a given percent of relative capacity remains, Battery health monitoring.\n\nAdvantages: Minimal physical testing required, Accelerated development of batteries, Considers temperature, starting capacity, and charging protocol among other factors."

Patients' outcomes without treatment can be predicted using historical control data, letting these same patients to undergo treatment instead of placebo.\nClinical trials are expensive endeavors that enroll many patients, a large fraction of which will not receive the experimental therapeutic. Some patients are deterred from participating in clinical trials because of the chance they will not receive treatment. In addition, some physicians find it unethical that patients are being denied treatment when they believe it will benefit them. To solve these issues, researchers have developed a software that employs deep learning to predict patient outcomes based on pre-clinical patient data and generate virtual control data. The software is trained on data from historical control patients and generates a likely outcome in the form of biomarker status or a clinical endpoint. This allows all patients in the clinical trial to undergo treatment. In addition, each patient serves as their own control, allowing the use of paired statistical tests.

Many solid tumors express a variety of these integrins, making integrins a prime target for anti-cancer therapy. PIP-LYTAC molecules work by recognizing a variety of integrins, including ?v?1, ?v?3, ?v?5, ?v?6, and ?5?1 integrins, on the cell surface. The molecule can then link the engaged integrin to a lysosome targeting receptor and trigger its internalization and degradation. Removing integrins from cancer cells could slow tumor progression and prevent metastasis. The PIP-LYTAC can also be tailored to target organ- or tissue-specific lysosomal targeting receptors, allowing this molecule to be functionalized for specific tumor types. Integrins are also involved in viral infections, making PIP-LYTACs a potential antiviral therapy.\nFigure: LYTACs can hijack the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASPGR) for targeted and cell-specific protein degradation.

However, the toxicity of the conditioning regimens used to achieve engraftment of allogeneic donor or autologous gene corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) continues to be a major obstacle. The researchers have determined that a hypomethylating agent, 5-Azacytidine (AZA), which is widely used in cancer therapy, can cause HSC depletion and permit engraftment of exogenous (donated) HSC. Furthermore, the combination of AZA and an anti-CD117 antibody results in more profound and prolonged depletion of recipient HSC compared to either agent alone, and treatment can result in robust and stable engraftment of donor HSC in immunocompetent wild type mice.\nStage of Development\nPreclinical proof of concept engraftment studies in vivo in mice.\n\nApplications: Conditioning prior to allogeneic HCT to treat:, Non-malignant disorders of the blood system including hemoglobinopathies (e.g., sickle cell anemia and thalassemia major), genetic and acquired immune deficiencies (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency, HIV), Certain genetic disorders affecting the central nervous system (e.g., metachromatic leukodystrophy, Hurler syndrome), Autoimmune non-hematologic (e.g., multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel diseases, juvenile idiopathic arthritis) and hematologic (e.g., immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Evans syndrome) diseases, Malignant myeloid and lymphoid hematologic disorders, Patients with failed or poor hematopoietic graft function, Conditioning prior to HCT of autologous gene corrected cells for a wide spectrum of diseases (e.g., disorders of the blood and lymphoid system, neurologic disorders).\n\nAdvantages: Substantially safer method for transplanting allogeneic donor or autologous gene corrected HSC, Potentially more targeted HSC depletion to allow engraftment of allogeneic donor HSC compared to standard-of-care reduced intensity conditioning regimens, Potentially better efficacy than AZA alone or AZA plus other standard-of-care agents at eliminating diseased myeloid clones from the bone marrow of patients with hematopoietic malignancies, Potential  to make HCT a more acceptable treatment for broader array of conditions."

Specifically, this method can produce wafers where the two sides have different features as well as through channels. Traditional methods of etching channels through a wafer only etch from one side, which allows the etching gas to pass through. This can cause previously etched features to be further etched beyond desired specifications or can mix with mounting assemblies to produce unwanted side products. This technology utilizes a series of masking and metallic layers to selectively etch and protect features on both side of the wafer while through channels are produced by etching from both sides. By etching through channels from both sides, the researchers prevent-over etching of a given side and control the size of these microchannels.

Stanford University,Photonic transformer based on light-emitting diodes for DC voltage conversion,Docket #: S20-443,"Issued: 11,923,873 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/photonic-transformer-based-light-emitting-diodes-dc-voltage-conversion,"Stanford researchers in the Shanhui Fan Group have developed a new type of voltage converter capable of both AC and DC boost and buck operation. Utilizing a non-switching photonic mechanism, the voltage converter (hereafter referred to as a """"photonic transformer"""") offers scalability across a wide range voltage ratios, supports high voltages, and provides excellent electrical isolation and Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) blocking, all within an extremely compact footprint with a substrate-transferrable thin-film profile.\nThe photonic transformer's basic design conceptually resembles a network of LEDs transferring energy to a network of Photo-Voltaic (PV) cells; however in the photonic transformer all of the LEDs and PV cells are monolithically integrated into a single thin-film device with one pair of input terminals and one pair of output terminals. The design utilizes a micron-scale high-index spacer to strongly couple the light-emitting and absorbing volumes, resulting in extremely high conversion efficiency. GaN-based implementations can achieve high output voltages with conversion efficiencies far above those of even today's best blue GaN-based LEDs. This near-unity power conversion efficiency furthermore eases thermal constraints to enable miniaturization of high-performance voltage converters while simultaneously improving electromagnetic compatibility and power quality for the systems they support.\nFigure description -  Figure description: Diagrammatic representation of a fully fabricated GaN-based photonic transformer (cross-sectional profile view). The emitting and absorbing GaN-based diode layers are grown serially, with the electrically-insulating, optically-transparent, nearly lattice-matched AlGaN layer grown between them.

When a battery charges at a high current, like when an electric vehicle is rapidly charging, lithium metal deposits on the battery anode in a process called lithium plating, accelerating the battery's failure.  Current detection of lithium plating involves invasive methods, fails to detect plating at its earliest stage, and/or does not allow detectors to reside onboard the battery and report on plating in real time.\nThis technology consists of an inexpensive device which detects lithium plating at its onset. The high sensitivity of the device promises faster R&D of battery technologies that attempt to address the issue of lithium plating. Additionally, since the device can be installed onboard a battery and communicate with its management system, engineers can include it in production batteries, where it will allow charging current to be adjusted to mitigate plating early. This technology represents a key innovation in the future of fast-charging batteries and next-generation battery health monitoring.\n\nApplications: Accelerated Research & Development: Early, non-invasive detection of lithium plating in lithium-ion batteries speeds up the development cycle for fast-charging battery solutions, Onboard Monitoring & Early Mitigation: Detect lithium plating and communicate with the battery management system to dynamically extinguish plating and ensure safe fast charging.\n\nAdvantages: Inexpensive: Uses a relatively inexpensive differential pressure sensor, Non-invasive: Monitor onset of lithium plating without destruction of battery, High sensitivity: See lithium plating at its onset so it can be mitigated, Novel Onboard Application: Coordinate detection with battery management system to dynamically adjust current and mitigate lithium plating before system failure."

Unfortunately, heterologous expression of transgenes in mammalian cells is susceptible to time-dependent epigenetic silencing. Regulatory elements that resist transgene silencing, such as ubiquitous chromatin opening elements (UCOEs), can improve transgene expression both in vitro and in vivo. However, known UCOEs are relatively long in sequence length and can exhibit intrinsic bidirectional promoter activity, resulting in reduced cloning utility and non-specific transcriptional activation, respectively. Furthermore, their efficacy is highly dependent on cell type and promoter choice. Thus, there remains a need for a chromatin opening sequence under 1 kb that can predictably stabilize a broad diversity of gene expression constructs without off-target effects.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors designed a computational algorithm to search the human genome for putative UCOEs and have identified and characterized a novel UCOE, SRF-UCOE, which stabilized transgene expression across several different promoters. SRF-UCOE outperformed the well-characterized UCOE, A2UCOE, and its associated truncations in both stable transfection and lentiviral integration experiments. This work helps to elucidate the underlying mechanism of these chromatin opening elements and expands their utility.\n\nApplications: Improved UCOE for use in existing biotechnology applications, Effective SRF-UCOE core sequence (761 bp) broadens utility in viral delivery systems for gene therapy.\n\nAdvantages: Versatile use in stable transfection and/or viral delivery systems, Stabilizes transgene expression across several common promoters, SRF-UCOE does not exhibit inherent transcriptional activity, limiting potential off-target effects."

Antibody switch constructs change conformation upon target analyte binding, displacing a blocking analyte to produce a detectable readout. The workflow for synthesizing antibody switch constructs is designed to be modular and relies on conjugating the blocking analyte of choice to a DNA scaffold, then assembling the remaining construct and reporters through attachment of the DNA linker to the Fc region of the antibody.

Addressing this issue, Stanford researchers have proposed a simple protocol that minimizes the component overhead for fault-tolerant quantum computation. This approach is based on a novel procedure for fault-tolerantly preparing three-dimensional cluster states using a single emitter and a pair of delay lines (see figure below).\nWith continued improvements in only a few components, these systems can be promising candidates for demonstrating fault-tolerant quantum computation with a comparatively modest experimental effort.\nFigure\nStage of Development\n\nApplications: Quantum error correction.\n\nAdvantages: Advances the practical implementation of fault-tolerant quantum computing, Lower engineering overhead imposed by quantum error correction compared to current methods, Simple protocol that minimizes the component overhead (from currently thousands to a few), Incremental improvements needed for only a few components."

The proposed device would be introduced endoscopically through the nose and target either the olfactory epithelium, sinonasal lining, cranial nerves or other intracranial neurologic structures for a predetermined amount of time.\nOur sense of smell is key to our ability to enjoy everyday events such as eating, drinking, and experiencing the natural world around us. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, over 20 million Americans experienced some form of the loss of sense of smell, and now there will be millions more. Yet there is no definitive treatment to jumpstart olfactory nerve regeneration and restore function. To address this need, a physician specializing in otolaryngology, with a courtesy appointment in neurosurgery, at Stanford University has developed a device to electrically stimulate olfactory nerves and induce nerve repair and regeneration. To determine whether electrical stimulation is a viable treatment method, researchers chemically damaged olfactory nerves in rats. One day after injury, a group of rats received one hour of continuous electrical stimulation at the olfactory bulb via electrodes placed intranasally. After one month, the treated rats improved their food-finding time compared to baseline whereas those who didn't undergo treatment had a worse score. This work shows that electrical stimulation of olfactory nerves can promote the recovery of neurons responsible for smell.\nGiven that there are over 200 causes of olfactory loss, the inventor proposes several device designs with which one can stimulate olfactory nerves. These include having a flexible probe that can accommodate nasal cavities of a variety of sizes and shapes, and having electrodes that can either stimulate the olfactory epithelium and olfactory nerve or olfactory bulbs. This invention is a minimally invasive device that has the potential to provide an effective solution for a debilitating problem.\n\nApplications: Treatment of olfactory loss due to altered function of the: cranial nerve, nose, paranasal sinus, or ventral skull base intracranial structures such as the olfactory bulb or cortex, Treatment of olfactory loss due to disorders such as: chronic rhinosinusitis, cranial neuropathy, or other intracranial pathology.\n\nAdvantages: No commercial olfactory stimulation devices currently available, Minimally invasive medical device, Can address a variety of olfactory injuries and disorders."

Scientists believe a lower level of """"social motivation,"""" or the desire to interact with others, is what causes ASD children to struggle with communication. To help ASD patients improve their social motivation and communication and track progress, therapists need a method that specifically quantifies social motivation levels in ASD patients.\nThe current methods for quantifying autism spectrum disorders include techniques like the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule (ADOS-2) and the Autism Quotient (AQ), but existing methods either do not measure social motivation directly or do not measure it thoroughly. In addition, some methods rely on ASD patient self-reporting, which is not feasible in many young children. The SSDS overcomes the limitations of previous methods through a parent/caregiver report questionnaire which comprehensively and sensitively assesses social motivation as well as other key social domains such as social recognition, in patients on the autism spectrum.

A common difficulty with current electrical approaches is getting the network to learn to solve a problem. This technology overcomes that issue by utilizing a feedforward photonic network of tunable beamsplitter nodes to simultaneously nullify nodes in parallel. For a given network with L device columns and N input nodes, this parallel nullification strategy is up to (N/2) times faster than existing component-wise calibration approaches. Overall, this would allow optical neural networks to implement fast and low power learning.\nRelated Technology:  """"S19-093 Efficient, scalable training of artificial neural networks directly on optical devices""""\nStage of Research\n\nApplications: Optical neural networks and machine learning, Optical communications systems, Self-training sensing systems.\n\nAdvantages: Reduced time spent optimizing arbitrary optical networks, Faster matrix multiplication (zero marginal energy cost) vs electronic systems."

Selective detection is achieved due to the unique redox potential of chemical species.\nThe ability to perform galvanostatic measurements when the electrodes are exposed to volatile organic species dispersed in a gas phase allows their detection and identification as they are oxidized and/or reduced at a specific applied voltage. By varying the material of the electrodes, specific species can be targeted. The selection of the electrode material is made on physico- chemical or electrocatalytic criteria.\nFigure\nStage of Research\n\nApplications: Gas sensors.\n\nAdvantages: Detects volatile organic species in the gas phase, Can differentiate multiple species with a single chip, High selectivity and ability to precisely identify the species present in the environment, Can be mass produced with form factor at the millimeter scale, Uses Nafion polymer in micro-fabrication process, Integrated reference electrode will considerably improve in the identification of the detected species, Benefits from electrocatalytic research on materials for the choice of electrodes."
Stanford University,Igf1r Knockout to Increase Donor Cell Contribution in Interspecies Organ Generation,Docket #: S20-041,"Published Application: WO2021207493, Published Application: 20230180725",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/igf1r-knockout-increase-donor-cell-contribution-interspecies-organ-generation,"Researchers in the Nakauchi lab at Stanford University have shown that the contribution of human donor cells to tissues and organs can be increased in an interspecies host embryo by knocking out insulin growth factor 1 receptor (Igf1r).\nThousands of people around the world await lifesaving organ transplants. However, given the shortage of available organs and subsequent long wait times, not everyone on a transplant list will receive the organ they need to survive. The Nakauchi lab studies the interspecies organ generation using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Researchers inject donor iPSCs into host embryos that later develop into a fetus with cells derived from both the host and donor animals. They can then determine what portion of the fetus's cells derive from either the host or the donor.\nPreviously, researchers found that the organs of the chimeric animals had a mixture of both host and donor cells. However, they discovered that knocking out insulin growth factor 1 receptor (Igf1r) increases donor cell contribution to organs. In one model, the kidney of a chimeric animal was made up almost entirely of donor cells. This research has the potential to revolutionize organ transplantation therapy. Although their current models only involve mouse-mouse and rat-mouse interspecies organ generation, further research could lead to the generation of human organs for transplantation and basic research.\nProof of concept – in vivo rodent models\n\nApplications: Organ transplantation therapy, Human organ regeneration, Basic research: drug discovery, toxicology testing, and drug screening in engineered organs.\n\nAdvantages: Increases the number of human donor cells in animal-grown human organs and tissues, Can help solve the issue of organ shortage for transplantation therapy."

Stanford University,Preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis with a combination of small molecules,Docket #: S20-149,Published Application: 20230201171,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/preventing-post-ercp-pancreatitis-combination-small-molecules,"Stanford researchers are developing an improved prophylactic against pancreatitis caused by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), by targeting two key inflammatory pathways. ERCP is a common gastrointestinal procedure that leads to pancreatitis in 3-15% of patients. Post-ERCP pancreatitis can be life-threatening, excruciatingly painful, and costly. Patients and healthcare providers would both benefit from more effective and practical pancreatitis prevention, beyond the current options of indomethacin, stenting, and IV hydration.\nThe inventors have discovered that calcineurin inhibitors prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis by blocking pressure-induced inflammatory signals. Additionally, a calcineurin inhibitor could be combined with indomethacin to target two distinct inflammatory pathways, achieving higher effectiveness than indomethacin alone. The inventors are formulating this combination for rectal administration to target pancreatic circulation via the portal vein. This method can be smoothly incorporated into ERCP procedures, because rectal indomethacin is the standard-of-care in many facilities.\nStage of Development: Preclinical studies in a mouse model of ERCP showed that calcineurin inhibitors lowered pancreatic inflammation, edema, and tight junction disruption when delivered systemically, intraperitoneally, or via radiocontrast solution.\n\nApplications: Prophylactic given rectally before any ERCP to prevent pancreatitis.\n\nAdvantages: Targets two key inflammatory pathways for greatly increased efficacy over indomethacin alone, Safer and less time consuming than pancreatic duct stenting and IV hydration, Minimally invasive rectal delivery directly targets pancreatic circulation, Easy to implement during ERCP, replacing standard-of-care rectal indomethacin, Both component drugs are FDA-approved for other indications."
Stanford University,Composite laminate tapering method for more efficient design,Docket #: S20-040,"Published Application: WO2021188783, Published Application: 20230075583, Issued: 12,005,682 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/composite-laminate-tapering-method-more-efficient-design,"Composite laminates can be lighter, stronger and lower cost if tapering is applied to remove laminate thickness in areas not heavily loaded. To this end, Stephen Tsai and his team have developed a new tapering strategy using efficient """"double-double"""" (DD) laminates (previously disclosed in Stanford docket S17-103).  Such DD building block is 4-ply thick and can slide to form a desired taper like a deck of cards.  The current building blocks are 10 or more times thicker.  It cannot slide because it is too thick like sliding bricks.  If individual plies are removed, the laminate properties will change.  Thus sliding strategy is great to reduce weight and easy to accomplish unless it is thin like cards.  With DD this would be perfect because each layer is engineered to have the desired property and form a stack of identical layers like a deck of cards, ready to slide. With this method, each ply in the laminate has the same or, dimensions, shape and size (instead of different sizes for each ply in the current conventional method). Taper is controlled by the degree of sliding of each ply.  The resulting tapered beam or panel will be stiff, strong, easily laidup, with minimum scrap.  Additionally, it will be lower weight and cost due to 4-ply thick  tDD building block and will be less prone to error, wrinkle, warpage and delamination.\nStage of Development\n\nApplications: Aircraft materials such as skins for fuselage, wings, bulkhead, and floor panel, Cars, trucks and buses such as panels and floors, Construction materials such as panels for floors, deck, and roof, Sports Equipment such as boards, skis, oars.\n\nAdvantages: Tapering saves weight, material, scrap, labor and can be a very fast process, Uses double-double laminates which is simpler to design and manufacture,  and stronger and lighter, Lower cost in layup and manufacturing overall., Uniform ply  in the laminate has the same dimensions and size, Homogenized laminate with thin plies are delamination resistant and designed just like metals."
Stanford University,Lithium Extraction through Pulsed Electrochemical Intercalation Method,Docket #: S20-114,"Published Application: WO2021188570, Published Application: 20230075724",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/lithium-extraction-through-pulsed-electrochemical-intercalation-method,"Stanford researchers have developed a new electrochemical method for extracting lithium from low concentration sources such as seawater. Despite containing 5000x more lithium than land and brine-based resources, the presence of sodium (4x that of lithium) in seawater has made clean extraction of lithium difficult. By using a TiO2-coated FePO4 to intercalate lithium into the electrode, researchers were able to achieve high selectivity for lithium. In cases where the Li/Na molar ratio is greater than 10-3, the diffusion barrier and thermodynamic intercalation potentials yield ~100% Li selectivity over Na. However, for seawater or water with lower Li/Na ratios, the pulse sequence developed here yields Li selectivity ~1.8 x 104 over Na. The pulse sequence additionally helps to stabilize the crystal structure, prolonging the electrode lifetime. This improved lithium extraction method is critical as the demand for lithium-ion batteries increases in the coming decades.\nStage of Research\n\nApplications: Lithium-ion battery materials, Lithium extraction.\n\nAdvantages: Lithium extraction from low concentration sources: seawater, lake water, Does not require pre-concentration of water into brine."

There are no known cures for psoriasis; current treatment options are not efficacious in all patients or beneficial for all aspects of the disease and can have severe side effects.  Chemokine like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) is expressed by pro-psoriatic white blood cells and binds attractant chemerin, which is upregulated in psoriatic skin.  2-(?-naphthoyl) ethyltrimethylammonium iodide (?-NETA) is a small molecule CMKLR1 antagonist we discovered that suppresses autoimmune demyelinating disease in vivo.  Here we show that oral administration of ?-NETA and novel ?-NETA analogs we discovered significantly suppress psoriasis in a preclinical mouse model that mimics many of the key features of human psoriasis.  Thus ?-NETA and its improved analogs hold great translational potential to reduce the impact of psoriasis on public health.\nRelated Technology:  """"S11-431 Small Molecule CMKLR1 Antagonists in Demyelinating Disease""""\n\nApplications: Psoriasis suppression.\n\nAdvantages: Selectively targets the trafficking of key inflammatory cell subsets."

Stanford University,"A Customizable, Modular Catheter for Hemodialysis Patients of All Ages",Docket #: S20-034,"Published Application: WO2021163200, Published Application: 20230090684",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/customizable-modular-catheter-hemodialysis-patients-all-ages,"Brief Description\nThe Thakor lab invented a small caliber central venous catheter with adjustable cuff positioning for customizable lumen length. It can be placed with a subcutaneous tunnel into any pediatric patient with kidney injury in order to perform hemodialysis. The pediatric modular catheter (PMC) supports pediatric blood flow rates and higher heart rates with an optimized symmetric tip that decreases arterial-related damage and cardiovascular risks with customizable cuff-to-tip lengths.\nTechnology Summary\nAcute and end stage renal disease affects patients across all ages. Pediatric patients are usually treated with hemodialysis, which requires them to be surgically implanted with a central venous catheter (CVC) for dialysis access. Unfortunately, current CVCs have a fixed length and are designed for adult patients. This leaves pediatric patients at an increased risk for arrhythmia, thrombosis, poor dialysis, and unnecessary discomfort. The Thakor lab invented a modular CVC with adjustable cuff positioning to produce the optimal catheter length for each patient and decrease arterial-related damage and cardiovascular risks in the process. The more favorable cuff-to-tip and tip-to-hub lengths help prevent catheter migration. The pediatric modular catheter (PMC) supports pediatric blood flow rates and higher heart rates, customizable lumen lengths, and reverse tunneling. It can be placed through the internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, or the femoral vein. Although pediatric CVCs are currently available on the market, they have fixed catheter lengths and diameters not suitable for the wide range of body types that occur from infant to adolescent patients. The modular design of the PMC offers customizability that can not only be applied to pediatric patients but can also be extended to adults of various body sizes. The invention offers a safer technology vital to reducing the risks and complications within patients undergoing hemodialysis.\nFigure Description: Modular catheter with adjustable lengths to accommodate patient body size\nImage credit: inventors\nStage of Development\nProof of Concept\n\nApplications: Hemodialysis patients.\n\nAdvantages: Compatible for pediatric patients, Adjustable catheter to accommodate patient size, Modular design allows for custom positioning."

The FDA has approved antibody therapies that block the interaction of PD-1 and PD-L1 for several tumor indications. However, this form of cancer immunotherapy has not been highly efficacious against solid tumors. This is largely due to the short half-life of antibodies, poor tumor targeting, and off-target toxicities. To improve upon this existing therapeutic, researchers at Stanford have developed PD-L1 antibody fragment-conjugated PEG-PGLA nanoparticles (NPs) for use against solid tumors.\nPEG-PGLA (poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)) NPs are FDA approved, water-soluble, and biocompatible. By attaching PD-L1 antibody fragments to the PEG-PGLA NPs, researchers were able to improve circulation of the therapeutic in mice. When mice bearing solid tumors were treated with NPs, tumor growth was delayed as compared to standard PD-L1 antibody treatment. Given these results, researchers believe that this treatment could be effective against a variety of solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma.\nFigure 1.

Stanford University,Assumption-Free Contrastive Component Analysis for Finding Data Trends,Docket #: S19-336,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/assumption-free-contrastive-component-analysis-finding-data-trends,"Researchers at Stanford have developed, for the first time, a component analysis algorithm that does not require any assumption on the data structure or data generation process to find out the important components or trends in data. Since the new method is not based on any assumption on underlying data structure, it can be applied in any fields and on any type of data. Data visualization, exploration, compression (dimension reduction), classification, clustering, etc. are critical tasks in various scientific and engineering fields. Such operations require finding the important data components or trends that best describe the variation in the data. There are several methods available (e.g., principal component analysis or PCA) that can serve these purposes in very specific cases based on the data structure or data acquisition methods. However, existing methods are based on some assumptions of underlying data structure and fail when these assumptions are not fulfilled. The new method does not impose any assumption on data structure or components and still is able to explore the data and ascertain the important components.\nStage of Development\nOngoing.

The conserved Hippo pathway normally functions to maintain optimal size across organs and species. Disrupting the pathway in the ovaries (either through direct or downstream inhibitors) promotes the growth of follicles that can then be induced to produce mature oocytes through conventional FSH and hCG treatments. This approach has both human and veterinary applications and may be particularly well-suited for treating conditions of diminished ovarian reserve (such as primary ovarian insufficiency, polycystic ovary syndrome, or peri-menopause).\n\nApplications: Human infertility treatment - therapeutic agents that inhibit Hippo signaling (including HSP90 inhibitors, PTEN inhibitors or PI3 kinase activators) to stimulate ovarian follicles for obtaining oocytes from patients with:\n\npolycystic ovary syndrome\nprimary ovarian insufficiency\nperi-menopause, polycystic ovary syndrome, primary ovarian insufficiency, peri-menopause, Veterinary medicine - stimulate ovarian follicles to obtain mature oocytes in farm animals or endangered species.\n\nAdvantages: Alternative to standard treatment - Hippo signaling inhibitors may provide an alternative to patients who do not respond to conventional FSH treatment because they have few follicles."

To achieve complex functions for academic research, agriculturial production, or industrial production, it is desirable to create transgenic organisms with multiple transgenic elements. Because of the underlying constraints imposed by genetic linkage and crossing-over, the incorporation of multiple transgenes is difficult, time-consuming, and largely limited to one transgene. Harnessing the recent advancement in CRISPR/Cas9 technology, researchers at Stanford created a novel system termed Super Recombinator (SuRe) that enables a significant reduction in turnover time for introducing N transgenes in the same locus from N-1 to log2N steps. Moreover, this strategy requires the selection of much fewer possible genotypes per step and does not involve embryo injection, thus further reducing labor, cost, and time. The success of the strategy has been demonstrated in vivo.\nStage of Development\nIn vivo demonstration of successful incorporation of multiple transgenes in animal brain.\n\nApplications: Introduction of multiple transgenes in synthetic biology, Create transgenic structures much larger than vector capacity, Simplify the recombination in multiploidy species, Research tool development.\n\nAdvantages: Two recombination strategies are available: activation recombination strategy and coordination recombination strategy, Faster turnover comparing traditional approach: The time complexity for recombining N genes is reduced from O(N) to O(log2N), Much fewer requirements on genotype selection at each step, High efficiency: The proportion of recombination product in progeny can reach 50%, High capacity: It is capable of recombining transgenes up to 5 Mbp, No need for embryo injection, Flexible to target to specific transgenic vector or specific genomic locus., Can adapt to existing transgenic strains, The method is generalizable for different species, Software for optimizing recombination processes is available."

PolyQ diseases are dominant genetic conditions caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat which then encodes protein with a long polyglutamine (polyQ) region. Transcripts containing expanded trinucleotide repeat segments in non-protein-coding regions of transcripts, or expanded segments of other trinucleotide repeats are similarly affected.   These non-functional variants then lead to protein aggregation and result in debilitating neurodegenerative disease.\nTargeting Supt4h (a transcription elongation factor) reduces the synthesis of long polyQ proteins – while still allowing for normal synthesis of non-mutant cellular proteins as well as proper folding of long polyQ stretches of protein. Small molecules or RNAi compounds targeting Supt4h could provide a new avenue for addressing the underlying cause of disorders such as HD, spino-cerebellar ataxia (SCA), dentatorubralpallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), or spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA).\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have demonstrated that small molecules targeting Supt4h reduce aggregation and increased functionality of polyQ proteins in neuronal cell studies.\n\nApplications: Drug development for neuromuscular disorders, including polyQ diseases (HD, SCA, DRPLA, SBMA).\n\nAdvantages: Unmet medical need - there is currently no effective treatment for HD or other neurological disorders caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions, Restored functionality - studies in cell culture show that this approach is capable of restoring function to  variant proteins that traditionally cause disease in a dominant fashion, Transcriptional control."

Almost all MS patients have been infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) prior to disease onset.  Further, B cell depletion therapies have demonstrated significant efficacy in MS. Researchers at Stanford have uncovered novel insight suggesting that EBV transcription factor EBNA-1 mimics a CNS-specific membrane protein, thereby inducing autoantibody responses against myelin. This presents evidence of a dominant B-cell autoantigen that can serve as a diagnostic to aid in the diagnosis of MS in patients. In addition, this points to the potential of inhibiting or eliminating EBNA1-specific B cells as a therapeutic approach for MS.\nStage of Development: Ongoing development of diagnostic and therapeutics.\n\nApplications: EBV-infection related autoimmune diseases including MS.\n\nAdvantages: Antigen-specific approach with reduced toxicity."
Stanford University,Double-Double Composite Laminates for Versatile Manufacturing,Docket #: S17-103,"Published Application: 20210114336, Issued: 11,446,897 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/double-double-composite-laminates-versatile-manufacturing,"Stanford researchers led by Stephen Tsai are advancing a new, much simplified design approach for composite laminates – termed """"double-double"""" – that can replace conventional laminates for lighter, tougher, and lower cost airplane structures among other uses. Whereas legacy quad laminates have remained static since their development in the 1960s and are becoming so complex that have added time and cost in their use.  They are no longer optimal.  Double-double laminates simplify optimization, leading to new structures with unmatched low weight and cost. As a result, the double-double composite structures can be designed and produced with tapers to save weight, to have ply drops on the exterior surface to remove defects from the interior, and 1-axis layup of multi-axial tape and fabric —in a customizable manner—meet requirements of many applications, from heavily loaded aircraft wings to sports products.\nReplacing legacy quad laminates with this technology opens up new frontiers. For example, it is possible to manufacture a fuselage, and wings in large pieces of structure, with fast layup, cured outside autoclave, with no fasteners, and easy to inspect and maintain. As other non-limiting examples, for rockets, pressure vessels, other structural forms including grid/skin as a special double-double, can also be designed and produced with ease, confidence and quality that can compete with metals\nA 21st century composite airplane in Otto Aviation's Celera 500L with extensive application of double-double (Image credit: the inventors)\nRelated Technology\nStanford docket S19-225 - Manufacturing of Composite Grid/Core/Skin Structures \nThis invention describes a rib-stiffened, composite grid skin structure design, which is ultra-lightweight, stiff, strong, and easier and less expensive to manufacture.\nStage of Development\nIn addition to the progress summarized here, tools are available to help in the design of specific shapes while taking advantage of all the great features\nof double-double composites.

This construction can be made in one piece, with no fasteners, fully interlocked and outside of autoclave, and can replace the conventional three-piece spar/rib/skin structure.  One unique feature of the grid is the use of finite length ribs placed in a staggered pattern, so all ribs have same dimensions and height to provide high stiffness and structural integrity.\nFigure 1 Grid/Skin Structure\nImage courtesy Stephen Tsai\nFigure 2 Tsai's designed panel (MTorres manufactured) at Paris Air Show 2019.\nPhoto courtesy Stephen Tsai\nStage of Development – Proof of Concept Prototype\nTsai's design is ready for application and can be modified for a variety of load cases.

Unlike prior examples of IL electrolytes, the EMIm cation's smaller size reduces viscosity and allows for practically relevant cathode mass loading. To increase reversibility, sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI) is added as the sodium ions incorporate into the passivation interphases. This helps prevent lithium dendrite formation, one of the most common issues with rechargeable batteries. The resulting lithium metal batteries with EMIm-5Li-Na Il electrolyte has high Coulombic efficiency (99.6-99.9%), long cycle life (>1200 cycles), and no flammability risk.\nStage of Research\n\nApplications: Portable electronics, Grid energy storage, Electric vehicles.\n\nAdvantages: Electrolyte safety: high thermal stability & non-flammable, High-capacity lithium metal batteries without traditional safety issues, Long battery cycle life: >1200 cycles."

Development of T cell-directed vaccines are important to prevent infectious diseases especially the chronic and persistent ones caused by complex pathogens in case of HIV and malaria. Though the challenge lies in inducing activation of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in sufficient magnitude. Similarly, cancer immunotherapies can benefit from a robust priming of CD8+ and CD4+ T cell to achieve effective tumor killing. This vaccine platform offers a promising solution whereby a single delivery of microparticles with antibodies against receptor CD244 (2B4, SLAMF4) or CD48 (SLAMF2) can allow sufficient CD8+ and CD4+ T cells activation. Additionally, the technology has the potential to treat allergic and autoimmune diseases if administrated alone or in combination with immunosuppressive molecules.\nanti-CD244 targeted microparticles (TMPs) prime antigen specific CD8+ T cells in vivo\nimage credit: inventor\nStage of Development\nTechnology has been demonstrated in mice.\n\nApplications: Modulating T cell and antibody-mediated immune responses in cancers, infectious diseases (viral and parasitic), allergic reaction and autoimmune diseases..\n\nAdvantages: Potential to stimulate or suppress immune response in humans, Dual targeting of receptor and natural ligand."

Clinical diagnosis of pathogen infection requires direct detection of the pathogen or detection of pathogen specific antibodies. Antibody detection is often the more reliable method of diagnostic testing. Current methods for detecting pathogen specific antibodies have significant limitations which can lead to inaccurate diagnostic results. Thus, new, more sensitive and specific methods are needed to diagnose pathogenic infection. To help meet this need the inventors have developed this technology to diagnose pathogenic infection and analyze immune response to infection. For this method, they have developed diagnostic pathogens- intact pathogens that have been genetically altered to express a fluorophore and to eliminate expression of conserved proteins and epitopes that are shared by many pathogens. The diagnostic pathogen is exposed to the patient sample and then analyzed for pathogen specific antibodies and the isotype distribution of the antibodies. This method enables more sensitive and specific diagnosis of pathogens, analysis of the immune response to such pathogens, and informed, targeted treatment of the infection.\nStage of research\nUsing only a small drop of blood, the inventors have shown this method can detect Borrelia Burgdorferi (the pathogen that causes Lyme disease) infection in live mice within the first week of infection.

Stanford University,Retinoic Acid to treat RBM20-dependent dilated cardiomyopathy,Docket #: S18-210,Published Application: WO2020092171,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/retinoic-acid-treat-rbm20-dependent-dilated-cardiomyopathy,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a method of using retinoic acid to treat dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).  DCM, a heart disease characterized by enlargement of the left ventricle and reduced systolic function, is the leading cause of heart failure and most common indication for heart transplant.  Recently, efforts have been made to identify the genetic causes of DCM.  Mutations in RBM20 (a regulator of heart-specific splicing of genes for muscle function) are associated with early onset of DCM, end stage heart failure and increased incidence of sudden death. Currently, despite the genetic understanding, therapeutic strategies to treat DCM only manage the symptoms. Thus, there is a need for better methods to treat DCM.  To help meet this need the inventors have taken advantage of the understanding of the genetic causes of DCM to develop a method to treat RBM20-dependent DCM.  RBM20 mutations reduce the functional level of RBM20 leading to DCM.  Here, the inventors provide a method of using retinoic acid to increase the RBM20 levels.  This leads to reversion of the splicing defect and mitigates the cellular phenotypes of DCM.  This technology offers a new therapeutic strategy to treat DCM and has the potential to improve the care of patients with RBM20-dependent DCM.\nStage of research\nUsing iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, the inventors have shown that upregulation of RBM20 by retinoic acid corrects the splicing defects and ameliorates the clinically relevant phenotypes.\n\nApplications: Treatment of RBM20-dependent dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\nAdvantages: New therapeutic strategy to more effectively treat DCM, Easily accessible, Limited and easy to monitor side effects, Treats the molecular cause of the disease rather than the symptoms."

This two-part system utilizes a family of UNIversal Orthogonal Network (UNION) bioinks and diffusive small molecule crosslinker support baths. UNION bioinks are functionalized hydrogel backbones (such as PEG, collagen, dextran, and hyaluronic acid, etc.) with variable levels of crosslinking moieties to tune stiffness. The 3D structure is bioprinted into the diffusive support bath which contains the complementary multifunctional crosslinker. These molecules diffuse into the printed structure and spontaneously crosslink the bioink, rendering the final structure.

Stanford University,Radiotherapy Treatment Plan Verification Algorithm,Docket #: S20-106,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/radiotherapy-treatment-plan-verification-algorithm,"Stanford researchers have used deep learning to create a radiotherapy treatment plan verification algorithm.  Patient specific dose verification is traditionally done by checking the dose in a patient-mimicking phantom or by using an independent dose calculation algorithm. Drawbacks include measurements that do not truly reflect clinical treatment, and patient-specific dose errors.  To efficiently improve the quality assurance (QA) process, researchers in the Xing Laboratory used a generative adversarial network (GAN) based, deep learning approach to estimate the MultiLeaf collimator (MLC) aperture and corresponding monitor units (MUs) from a given 3D dose distribution.  Data from 199 patients, including nasopharyngeal, lung and rectum, treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) techniques, trained the network. An additional 47 patients were used to test the model prediction accuracy.  Leaf position prediction accuracy is around one pixel, and corresponding MU prediction accuracy is within 2% (figure 1).  It takes about a week to train the model, but executing the trained model takes only seconds.  A physicist can check MLC and MU settings and verify the plan right away after treatment planning. This technique has the potential to significantly improve efficiency, safety, and accuracy of the patient plan QA process.\nFigure 1 - Comparison of treatment plan and deep learning derived plan verification\nStage of Development – Prototype \nResearchers continue to optimize the verification algorithm using more treatment sites to train a more comprehensive model, and explore different neural network architecture.\n\nApplications: Plan verification for radiation therapies, including IMRT,  VMAT, SBRT, SRS.\n\nAdvantages: Accurate, intuitive, and efficient, Reduces experimental measurement burden in Quality Assurance process."
Stanford University,"Genetically corrected, iPSC-derived epithelial sheets to treat RDEB",Docket #: S19-060,Published Application: 20230045590,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/genetically-corrected-ipsc-derived-epithelial-sheets-treat-rdeb,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a targeted gene therapy approach to treat patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) represents a group of debilitating inherited skin disorders in which blisters develop after minor trauma to the skin. Symptoms and severity depend on type of EB. RDEB is the most severe form of EB. It is caused by the absence of the type VII collagen protein, the main component of the anchoring fibrils which tether the epidermis to the dermal tissue underneath. Patients with RDEB develop large, severely painful blisters and open wounds that eventually lead to infection and development of squamous cell carcinoma. The extensive blistering and open wounds on the skin greatly affect patient quality of life, with patients reporting severe daily pain, especially during wound care. Currently, there is no cure for RDEB as existing treatments are only supportive in nature. To help meet this need, the inventors have developed a scalable and cGMP compatible gene therapy approach. This approach uses CRISPR to correct mutations in the COL7A1 gene, where type VII collagen is encoded, in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These gene-corrected iPSCs are then used to generate keratinocyte sheets for grafting to treat RDEB. This technology provides a much-needed treatment for RDEB.\nStage of Research\nProof-of-concept studies show this approach can be used to correct mutations at different sites within the COL7A1 locus to make COL7A1-corrected iPSCs.

Stanford University,BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AGAINST DENGUE VIRUS,Docket #: S18-469,Published Application: WO2020033491,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/broadly-neutralizing-antibodies-against-dengue-virus,"Researchers at Stanford and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub have discovered cross reactive, broadly neutralizing human antibodies against all serotypes of dengue virus.\nDengue virus (DENV) is transmitted to humans through mosquitos and causes approximately 400 million global infections each year. DENV has four antigenically distinct serotypes (DENV 1-4), and reinfection with a heterologous DENV serotype is a risk factor for developing potentially fatal severe disease. This increased risk is partially due to the prevalence of cross-reactive antibodies from the initial infection that can bind to but not neutralize the secondary viral serotype and instead causes antibody-dependent enhancement and disease enhancement. Furthermore, there is no approved antiviral treatment for dengue infection. Therefore, it is desirable to create a DENV therapeutic, or vaccine, which can elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against all DENV serotypes simultaneously.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have identified cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies from DENV-infected individuals. The inventors leveraged bioinformatics-based analyses of clonally expanded and somatically hypermutated B cells to focus their screen for candidates which are likely to produce antigen-specific and affinity-matured antibodies. Through single-cell transcriptomics of cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) of both dengue patients and healthy individuals the inventors discovered neutralizing monoclonal antibodies which exhibit broad neutralization of all DENV serotypes.\n\nApplications: Pharmaceutical treatment of dengue virus, Diagnostic identification of dengue virus infection.\n\nAdvantages: Antibodies and antigen binding portions thereof which can specifically recognize, and broadly neutralize, all DENV serotypes."

This targeted insertion depends upon homologous recombination (HR) that uses endogenous DNA repair pathway in host cells. However, HR occurs at very low rates in mammalian cells, which is currently one of major rare limitation to expand the clinical application of gene targeting therapies, especially in the case of AAV-mediated HR (AAV-HR) without use of programmable nuclease, such as CRISPR/Cas9.\nTechnology\nResearchers in the Mark Kay group have identified a method to increase the rates of AAV vector-mediated HR (AAV-HR) in mammalian cells, increasing the efficiency of gene targeting rate. Both in vitro and in mouse models, treatment of cells with a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor results in more efficient integration of therapeutic genes into a variety of target cell types.\nA variety of ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, including hydroxyurea, gemcitabine, and fludarabine, can be used to drive augmented integration. In animal studies, only a short-term treatment of RNR inhibitor shows significant increase of nuclease-free AAV-HR efficiency without causing obvious toxicity.

Stanford University,CD9 and NK receptor ligands: a novel target and companion diagnostic for stratifying women with ovarian cancer most likely to benefit from NK immunotherapy,Docket #: S19-355,"Published Application: WO2021050200, Published Application: 20220326244",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/cd9-and-nk-receptor-ligands-novel-target-and-companion-diagnostic-stratifying-women,"Ovarian Cancer Overview\nOvarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy having a 5-year relative survival of 49% (2010-2016) in the US. Among women with cancer, ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of death. Globally, the incidence of ovarian cancer was estimated at 295,400 and 184,800 deaths (Globocan 2018). In the US, 21,750 new cases and 13,940 deaths are estimated to occur in 2020. The US prevalence in 2017 was estimated at over 233,400. Efforts to develop effective prevention and treatment of this disease are very challenging because 80% of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease (regional and distant metastases) which correlates to increased mortality. There is still an enormous need to develop effective and safe treatments that can surmount these obstacles. Addressing this need is of the highest priority for women with ovarian cancer.\nA variety of modalities are used alone or in combination to treat patients including, surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, hormone and immunotherapy. Cancer immunotherapy is a relatively recent paradigm-shifting treatment modality in oncology that, drives an immune response against cancer cells. Most immunotherapy approaches targeting a patient's T cells have shown remarkable success for a variety of malignancies. However, ovarian cancer is largely unresponsive, despite tumors having high levels of immune checkpoint proteins such as PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3 and PD-LI\nNatural Killer (NK cells). are a type of white blood cell (lymphocyte) and a component of the innate immune system. They have an important role in rejecting tumors through their potent killing function. Several approaches are in development capitalizing on the killing function of NK cells. Nevertheless, tumors skillfully develop mechanisms to suppress NK cell cytolytic function.\nNovel findings for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of ovarian cancer\nDr. Fantl and her laboratory conducted studies resulting in novel findings that may provide insight into the reasons that ovarian cancer tends to be unresponsive to immunotherapies.  The Fantl Lab applied Mass cytometry (aka Cytometry by Time-Of-Flight (CyTOF)) to study the diverse cell types within primary ovarian tumor samples. The data revealed an intra-tumoral specific NK cell type that correlated with overall tumor mass. Remarkably, this NK cell type had features of decidual NK cells (nonkilling NK cells) that serve as an immune protectant, critical in the first trimester of pregnancy. Clearly, there could be no stronger form of immune suppression needed than for a mother-to-be to tolerate her fetus.\nTo determine how tumor cells could endow intra-tumoral NK cells with immune-suppressive properties, Dr Fantl's Lab performed a CyTOF analysis to measure NK receptor ligand expression levels present on tumor cells. These ligands represent a complex network of molecules that upon binding to NK cells promote their ability to kill tumor cells while binding of other ligands block tumor cell destruction. The NK receptor ligands were expressed in different combinations within three distinct ovarian intra-tumoral cell types each representing different states of tumor progression all within the same tumor sample. These three cell types represent: i) tumor cells within a primary tumor mass with cells all adhered to one another ii) cells transitioning to a metastatic state and iii) cells that have migratory and metastatic properties. The most suppressive combination of ligands was found in the metastatic cell types. These data provide insight into how tumor cells differentially regulate NK cell function to bypass killing activity and permit expansion of tumor cells.\nOne of the hallmark features of decidual NK cells is their expression of the surface protein CD9. The Fantl Lab demonstrated that in primary ovarian tumors, CD9 was abundantly expressed by both the intra-tumoral NK cells and ovarian tumor cells. Using reliable in vitro models of ovarian tumors, their Lab co-incubated ovarian tumor cells, representing the three stages of tumor progression with the NK-92 cell line chosen because it is used in the clinic in a variety of engineered forms. NK-92 cells do not express CD9. However, upon co-incubation with ovarian tumor cell lines, they acquired CD9 by a process called trogocytosis (greek: trogo – to gnaw) whereby a recipient cell extracts a membrane fragment from a neighboring cell, which in this case was the acquisition by NK-92 cells of an ovarian tumor cell membrane fragment incorporating CD9. Dr Fantl's Lab demonstrated that CD9 conferred NK-92 cells with immune-suppressive properties and furthermore with a CD9 blocking antibody, these properties were reversed such that NK-92 cells killed the ovarian tumor cells.\nThe presence of decidual-like NK cells has also been demonstrated in colorectal, melanoma, glioblastoma, lung and breast cancers (Albini and Noonan, Cancer Discovery 2020). Thus, the findings described for ovarian cancer can potentially have much broader applications.\nState of Development\nProof of concept\n\nApplications: CD9 identified as a target to optimize NK cell immunotherapy. For example a patient could be pre-treated with a CD9 antibody before receiving NK immunotherapy. This blocking CD9 antibody could: i) prevent CD9 acquisition by the administered NK cells ii) activate intra-tumoral decidual-like NK cells to have a killing function., CD9 identified as a target to activate endogenous intratumoral decidual-like NK cells., NK receptor ligand expression as a companion diagnostic for multiple NK immunotherapies., Assisting more accurate prognosis based on Identification of novel biomarkers for stratifying ovarian cancer patients., Optimization of NK cell therapies on the basis of NK receptor ligand expression levels., Frequency of decidual-like NK cells as a biomarker for response to T cell immunotherapies..\n\nAdvantages: CD9 offers a novel target for NK immunotherapy., NK receptor ligand expression levels on tumor cells offer a potential companion diagnostic for MK immunotherapy., Monoclonal CD9 antibody may be developed for commercialization., Technology can be extended to other cancer types (colorectal, melanoma, glioblastoma, lung, and breast cancers)., High throughput quantitative screening of tumor samples for key prognostic markers determined by the investigations above., Prediction of specific therapies that could provide the greatest clinical efficacy on a per-patient basis.."
Stanford University,Engineered Cytotoxic T Cells and CD200 Blockade to Enhance Anti-Tumor Activity,Docket #: S19-505,"Published Application: WO2022036116, Published Application: 20230285560",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/engineered-cytotoxic-t-cells-and-cd200-blockade-enhance-anti-tumor-activity,"Engineered cytotoxic T cells are a promising class of cell therapies. These living drugs are capable of selectively killing blood cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and delaying its progression. In addition to engineering the T cells, we have found that upregulated CD200 expression on tumor cells impairs degranulation and confers resistance to killing. This is due to the cytotoxic T cells expressing the cognate receptor CD200R1, which facilitates an inhibitory signal upon binding to CD200. CD200 blockade with high affinity antibodies can enhance the anti-tumor activity of the engineered cytotoxic T cells. Furthermore, CD200 blockade alone can also assist endogenous cytotoxic T cells in mediating killing. CD200 expression could also be a biomarker to guide treatment decisions.\n\nApplications: CD200 blockade with and without engineered cytotoxic T cells for treating blood cancers, Prognostic marker for treatment of blood cancers.\n\nAdvantages: Treatment modality to overcome resistance against cytotoxic T cells, Combination synergy between antibody blockade and cell therapy."
Stanford University,Phytophotonic Approach to Enhanced Photosynthesis,Docket #: S19-357,"Published Application: WO2022067258, Published Application: 20240276925",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/phytophotonic-approach-enhanced-photosynthesis,"Stanford researchers have shown how to use fluorescent and phosphorescent materials to provide plants with photons in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) range for increased crop yields and CO2 fixation. While genetically modifying plants with enhanced photosynthetic efficiency in a scalable manner has proven difficult, tailoring resources plants need is much easier. This invention increases the amount of PAR photons plants receive through a two-pronged approach: a) fluorescent down-conversion materials and 2) phosphorescent materials. The former down converts UV photos to green wavelengths to better target unsaturated photoreceptors deeper within the canopy or individual leaves. The second approach utilizes phosphorescent materials to address periods without direct illumination and overcoming saturated photosystems. Energy absorbed by the phosphorescent materials are emitted on a time delay to help spread excess solar energy over time. These materials can be applied via thin films on bioreactor surfaces, greenhouse roofing, directly onto plant surfaces, or in the soil surrounding the plants.\nStage of Research\n\nApplications: Bioprocessing: bioreactors, fuels, chemicals, etc., Agriculture: increased crop yields and/or CO2 sequestration, Forestry: CO2 sequestration.\n\nAdvantages: Wider applicability via conversion to green light, Targeting and saturation of cells deeper in foliage and canopy."

Otitis media (OM) is when the middle ear becomes inflamed and affects 90% of children worldwide. Without accurate diagnosis and treatment, OM could lead to further complications, such as speech and language impediment, brain abscesses, meningitis, and permanent hearing loss.\nThe current standard of care for OM diagnosis is pneumatic otoscopy to detect the presence of fluid in the middle ear. This is highly error-prone and a better method could readily supplant this diagnostic technique. For OM treatment, on the other hand, one has to surgically insert a tube into the tympanic membrane and suction out the fluid, or administer high dose antibiotics systemically or orally. Neither are ideal for patient outcomes or experience. An effective method for local and concentrated delivery (for both diagnosis and treatment) is missing.\nWe have developed an ear drop based on liposomal nanoparticles that penetrate the eardrum without an incision and can deliver therapeutic agents and/or contrast agents to the middle ear/inner ear chamber.

Photonics offers many advantages over superconducting systems as a platform for quantum computing, but it typically lacks scalability since machine size scales with quantum circuit depth.  The Fan Group's design (Figure 1) uses a single atomic qubit controlled by a laser to indirectly manipulate the state of a large number of photonic qubits which counter-propagate through a fiber optic ring. Any quantum circuit can be deterministically implemented by this device, and readout of the quantum state is not limited by the low efficiencies of single-photon detectors.  Unlike most designs for photonic quantum computers, the physical size of this device is independent of quantum circuit depth.  This scheme has high fidelity even in the presence of realistic experimental imperfections and is significantly simpler and less resource-intensive than existing paradigms for photonic quantum computing.\nFigure 1. Architecture for a scalable photonic quantum computer  Courtesy of The Fan Group\nStage of Development – Proof of Concept\nThe system concept has been proven theoretically and next steps are to build an apparatus.\n\nApplications: Quantum computing.\n\nAdvantages: Scalable: for a fixed number of qubits, the physical size of this design is independent of the depth of the circuit to be implemented, Experimentally simple: only one controllable qubit is needed, bypassing the challenge of integrating many quantum gates or identical quantum emitters into a single device, Does not require single-photon detectors, which are a significant limitation for photonic quantum computers, Deterministic, and thus less resource intensive than cluster-state, measurement-based, or linear-optical quantum computing schemes."
Stanford University,Selective Atomic Layer Deposition of Al2O3 with a New Precursor and Small Molecule Inhibitor,Docket #: S20-290,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/selective-atomic-layer-deposition-al2o3-new-precursor-and-small-molecule-inhibitor,"Researchers from the Bent group have identified a new precursor and small molecule inhibitor combination for Al2O3 area-selective atomic layer deposition (ALD).  Important for back end of line (BEOL) processes of high-volume manufactured semiconductor devices, Al2O3 ALD is crucially used as a hard mask and thus requires clean edges with high area selectivity. Also, Al2O3 has been widely used as semiconductor device components in front EOL (FEOL) such as gate oxide, passivation layers, and barrier layers, which also requires area-selective growth. Other applications using Al2O3 such as energy storage, sensing, and display may also benefit from area selective deposition. Current methods utilize trimethylaluminum (TMA) as an ALD precursor, but TMA exhibits low selectivity at commercially relevant thicknesses. Such an issue is further exacerbated as semiconductor features increasingly downsize. In contrast, the deposition process using the new aluminum precursor and small molecule inhibitor achieves 98% area selectivity up to 4 nm of Al2O3 on Cu and Si-OH substrates. This dramatic increase in selectivity, ~0% for TMA vs. 98% for the new precursor, demonstrates the high value of this system to various Al2O3 ALD applications.\nStage of Research\n\nApplications: ALD requiring control over location, thickness, and roughness without external liquid-phase processing steps, ALD for topography or patterning at back end of line, ALD for gate oxide, passivation layer, and barrier layer at front end of line, Selective ALD deposition for nanoscale patterns.\n\nAdvantages: 98% selectivity up to 4nm using TEA vs. ~0% using TMA, Applicable for bare Cu or Si-OH substrates, as well for a variety of other metals and metal oxides, Vapor phase deposition of small molecule inhibitors for area-selective ALD."

Confirmed in studies using both mouse and human cells, the PVA replaces the use of fetal bovine serum, bovine serum albumin, and recombinant serum albumin in media – all of which display batch-to-batch variability and are not GMP-grade reagents. Advantages of using PVA include that it is a lower cost, biologically inert reagent that is available at high-purity with minimal batch-to-batch variability. The new, PVA-based media will be useful for culturing cells for clinical bone marrow or HSC transplantation as well as T cell therapies that require large-scale expansion of T cells.\nStage of Development\nThe researchers have shown that PVA can replace serum albumin in a range of blood and immune cell cultures including cell lines, primary leukemia samples and human T lymphocytes.

The scanning mirror is doubly resonant on each of its two rotation axes, which makes Rose scanning possible. (Figure 1)  The scanning element oversamples the center by passing through the center, or close to it, twice in every cycle, and thereby rapidly defines the center of the Field of View, which is critical in dynamic imaging modalities like LiDAR.  The invention also supports one dimensional scanning, where it oversamples the center of the scan, as opposed to harmonic scans (1D Lissajous) that oversample on the edges of the scans.

Current amplifiers operating outside their nominal frequency experience fluctuations in performance, thus requiring power amplifier stages or components that need to be manually swapped or adjusted which is unsustainable for applications requiring adjustable RF frequencies. This wideband resonant inverter design features a push-pull power amplifier stage driving a bandpass filter, followed by a balun and matching network stage. The push-pull class-ef2 circuit power amplifier stage uses a T network to provide zero-voltage switching and shunt the second harmonic current to shape the voltage waveform. This circuit topology presents lower device stress compared to the popular class-e circuit, enabling higher power levels and efficiency. Combined with a variable capacitor, this allows for the resonant frequency of the T-network to be adjusted. Further along, the added feature helps the power amplifier stage to achieve zero-voltage switching and near zero-derivative-voltage-switching, which minimizes switching loss and circulating current throughout the converter. Thus, this network helps the wideband circuit to achieve high efficiency.\nPhoto description: Block diagram of the wideband resonant inverter.\nStage of Research\n\nApplications: RF Power Generators.\n\nAdvantages: Constant power and maintained high performance outside point of resonance, Best suited for applications requiring RF power frequency adjustments."

Therefore, the identification of biomarkers for increased susceptibility to dengue disease could dramatically reduce mortality rates by enabling early hospitalization of those at highest risk for disease progression. Here, the inventors conducted a global analysis of anti-dengue IgGs from mothers of infants with known disease severity during primary dengue infections in order to identify features of maternal IgGs that indicate dengue disease risk in infants.\nStage of Research\nThe glycosylation state of the IgG Fc domain plays a role in modulating inflammatory effector cell responses. The inventors discovered that the mothers of infants with clinically significant dengue disease had elevated levels of afucosylated IgG Fc domains compared to mothers of infants with subclinical dengue disease.

Stanford University,A STRATEGY FOR CREATING VACCINES TO ELICIT ANTIBODIES TARGETING A SPECIFIC EPITOPE,Docket #: S18-206,"Published Application: WO2019222674, Published Application: 20210139542",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/strategy-creating-vaccines-elicit-antibodies-targeting-specific-epitope,"Researchers at Stanford, funded in part by the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, have developed PMD (Protect, Modify, Deprotect), an immunofocusing strategy that can be used in vaccine development for the generation of antibodies targeting a specific epitope.\nVaccine development is a ground-breaking accomplishment in the biomedical field, leading to the near eradication of several diseases. Many vaccines provide long-lasting protection against infectious disease by eliciting an antibody immune response against a particular antigen. However, the generation of an antibody immune response towards some infectious agents has proved difficult. For example, in the case of viruses like influenza and HIV, most of the antibodies generated by vaccination target highly variable regions of the virus surface. These immunodominant variable regions preclude the generation of an immune response against more constant, and therefore desirable, regions of an infectious agent. Thus, there is a need for immunofocusing strategies, or the creation of vaccines that focus the antibody response toward these more desirable epitopes.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed an immunofocusing method called Protect, Modify, Deprotect (PMD), which directs the immune response towards a desired epitope of an antigenic protein. The method involves selecting an antigenic protein, comprising both target and non-target epitope regions. The target epitope is then protected by the introduction of a binding partner. The remainder of the protein is chemically modified while the desired antigenic region is shielded.  After chemical modification, the shield for the desired epitope is removed. This immunofocused antigenic protein can then be used to generate a vaccine-induced response. The authors demonstrate the utility of the PMD method by generating antibodies targeting desired regions of an influenza virus. This strategy has the potential to create high-specificity vaccines to formerly non-targetable regions of infectious agents.\nStage of Development\nResearch -\nin vitro\n\nApplications: Generation of antigenic proteins with a desired epitope, Antigenic protein complexes can be used for in vivo immunization.\n\nAdvantages: Facile and generalizable method for creating desired immunogenic proteins, Preserves the target epitope while decreasing non-target antigenicity."

For example, assaying tumor cells allows determination of mutations enriched in tumor cell populations. However, current methods of single cell analysis have largely been limited to a single measurement. The capability to screen single cells based on desired phenotypes before downstream -omics sequencing analysis would greatly reduce assay costs while also increasing our understanding of the interplay between phenotype and genetic mechanism. Therefore, there is a need to develop a high-throughput approach for multi-parametric analyses of single cells.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed an efficient and robust workflow for the multi-parametric analysis of single cells. They use a combination of microfluidic single-cell encapsulation into double emulsion droplets, which are compatible with aqueous high-throughput fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) for downstream molecular profiling.

While mAbs are clinically beneficial, there is still a need for other small molecule immune checkpoint inhibitors of PD-1. Unfortunately, previous attempts to develop PD-1 small molecule inhibitors have been unsuccessful, due to both the natural structure of PD-1 and the small cavity formed after ligand binding. The development of PD-1 small molecule inhibitors will provide cheaper and more accessible cancer treatment alternatives.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors performed deep mutational scanning of several loops within human PD-1 and identified a triple mutant with markedly increased affinity for the ligand PD-L2. Crystal structures of the triple mutant alone and in complex with PD-L2 revealed the formation of a small cavity upon ligand association. This pocket provides an attractive impetus for the future rational design, identification and synthesis of small molecules for PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibition.\nStage of Development\nResearch – in vitro\n\nApplications: The pocket identified here in human PD-1 can serve as a template for virtual drug discovery (26)and opens up additional avenues for the discovery of small-molecule PD-1 inhibitors..\n\nAdvantages: Previously there was no structure of human PD-1 bound to PD-L2."
Stanford University,Prediction of Individual Phenotypes and Polygenic Risk,Docket #: S19-237,Published Application: 20240301378,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/prediction-individual-phenotypes-and-polygenic-risk,"Stanford researchers have developed a technology to better understand the effects of rare genetic variants on an individual's common disease risk. In particular, the researchers focus on rare variants which are highly challenging to interpret using traditional genetic methods such as GWAS, but are still predicted to have relatively large effects on disease phenotypes.\nThe technology (""""IOGC"""") builds on recent findings showing that rare variants linked to molecular outliers (e.g. gene expression, splicing) are enriched for large effects on downstream disease risk. As a proof-of-concept, IOGC applied to predicting individual risk for severe obesity showed that a burden of rare variants linked to molecular outliers is associated with deviation from predicted disease risk. Individuals with extreme IOGC had a younger age of onset of clinical obesity, high blood pressure (~2.5 years), and diabetes (~4 years). These effects are independent of those captured by current polygenic risk scores (PRS), with joint modeling of PRS + IOGC resulting in more accurate disease risk classification across multiple polygenic traits.\nThis technology is the first to provide individual disease risk assessment by integrating the additive effects of rare, large-effect variants linked to molecular expression outliers. There are important implications of this technology in the clinical deployment of current disease PRS, gene therapies, and drug discovery.\n\nApplications: Clinical diagnosis of disease risk, Direct-to-consumer genetic testing for disease risk, Stratification of patients for treatment regimens, Reduced search space for experimental validation of combinatorial gene targets with combined large phenotypic effects, Identification of novel genetic targets for drug discovery, particularly gene therapies.\n\nAdvantages: Identification of rare variants with larger effects than GWAS common variants allows for powerful modeling of gene regulatory effects on disease phenotypes, Approach can utilize multiple forms of genetic variation, e.g. SNPs, short indels, SVs, Approach can utilize multiple molecular outlier data, e.g. gene expression, splicing, protein level."

Stanford University,Torque Sensing Retractors that Reduce Tendon and Muscle Damage,Docket #: S19-526,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/torque-sensing-retractors-reduce-tendon-and-muscle-damage,"Derek F. Amanatullah and his research group developed an instrumented retractor that was designed to record the applied force, duration, and angle of retraction during a piriformis-sparing posterior approach to the hip. Piriformis-sparing posterior approaches to the hip allow surgeons to avoid releasing the piriformis tendon during total hip arthroplasty. However, the consequence of retracting an intact piriformis musculotendinous complex during a piriformis-sparing posterior approach to the hip remains ill-defined. Dr. Amanatullah used the retractor to determine the upper limit of force that can be applied during retraction of the piriformis musculotendinous complex and quantifies the subsequent damage to the piriformis musculotendinous complex caused by retraction. In addition to the data collected with use of the instrumented retractor, damage to the piriformis muscle and tendon was quantified by a blinded observer. There was no damage to the piriformis tendon in 22 (96%) of 23 hips during piriformis retraction for visualization of the hip capsule. However, there was complete or partial damage to the piriformis muscle at the sacral origin, belly, or musculotendinous junction (i.e., outside the surgical field) noted in 21 (91%) of 23 hips. The mean peak force to failure of the piriformis muscle was exceedingly small (29.0 ± 9.4 N; range, 10.1 to 44.9 N). The mean peak force applied to the piriformis retractor is much less than the force required for several common daily activities, such as opening a door or crushing an empty aluminum can. Dr. Amanatullah et al. (2020) in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery concluded that soft tissue damage that occurs outside the surgical field during the retraction of unreleased muscles, like the piriformis muscle, is common and remains an uncontrolled surgical variable. This inadvertent soft tissue damage is not routinely accounted for when accessing the invasiveness of a procedure. Hence, it is no longer adequate to define a minimally invasive surgical procedure simply as an approach that involves the limited release of anatomical structures. The use of instrumented retractors redefines surgical invasiveness by providing data that could alter our understanding of the soft tissue damage caused by retraction and open the possibility of robot-assisted or damage limiting retractor systems.\nStage of Research\n\nApplications: Surgical procedures, Joint replacements.\n\nAdvantages: Real time monitoring, Force and angle measurements for soft tissue damage warnings."

Anxiety is characterized by several features that are coordinately regulated by diverse neuronal system outputs.  These features range from behavioural choice patterns, such as risk avoidance, to changes in physiology exemplified by respiratory rate alterations.  A major limiting step in the treatment of anxiety is the inability to selectively control the various features of the disease.  For instance, some features may not be that troubling whereas others, such as elevated respiratory rate, may be debilitating or life threatening.  It would be of great value to be able to individually regulate the various disease features.  This technology describes a new role for the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the coordinated modulation of diverse anxiety features and provides methods to selectively tune these features.\nStage of research\nThe inventors have demonstrated that distinct BNST subregions exert opposite effects in modulating anxiety and define separable anxiolytic roles for different anterodorsal BNST projections.\nOngoing research\nAdditional work in mapping anxiety circuitry.\n\nApplications: Treatment of anxiety- including selective regulation of the various disease features., Development of research tools to screen new anxiety therapeutics..\n\nAdvantages: Precise, Specific-could allow selective regulation of different anxiety features.."

This method measures the repressive ability of silencer elements (ReSE) by screening for genomic fragments that repress the transcription of an inducible cell death protein. Genomic silencers – noncoding regions that repress gene expression—are an important class of regulatory elements, but systematic methods of identification and analysis have been lacking to date. As such, silencers have been understudied. ReSE is a robust screening system developed to meet this need.

Stanford University,Chemical Additive Reduces Cost of Manufacturing mRNA,Docket #: S20-258,Published Application: 20230272465,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/chemical-additive-reduces-cost-manufacturing-mrna,"Stanford researchers have discovered that ribonucleoside vanadyl complexes can be used as an additive in transcription reactions resulting in ~2-fold increased yield. Currently, manufacturing industrial-scale mRNA (e.g., for vaccines) is very expensive, in part because most of these manufacturers rely on costly T7 RNA polymerase as the enzyme for mRNA synthesis. Using low concentrations (0.1 mM) of ribonucleoside vanadyl complexes as enhancers, the researchers were able to obtain superior yields of RNA. As it is extremely cheap to purchase ($0.000086/20 ul reaction), the use of this additive could effectively cut the cost of manufacturing mRNA in half. Moreover, it is an RNase inhibitor that specifically enhances T7 RNA polymerase kinetics. It does not alter the kinetics of other tested RNA polymerases.\nThis technology is part of a portfolio of innovations aimed at fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.\nExplore a portfolio of RNA vaccine technologies and tools:\nStanford docket S20-224 - Algorithm for Maximizing mRNA Thermodynamic Stability\nStanford docket S20-183: https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/mrna-vaccines-methods-synthesis-and-stability-assessment\n\nApplications: Industrial-scale mRNA manufacturing (e.g., mRNA vaccines), COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing.\n\nAdvantages: Superior yields ~ 2X, Dramatically reduces manufacturing costs, Specifically enhances T7 RNA polymerase kinetics."

Cement is the second most consumed resource in the world, accounts for 8% of the world's CO2 emissions, is tough to recycle, and has a lifetime of about 50-100 years or less. In response, the Rocks and Geomaterials Laboratory at Stanford has engineered a low to near-to-zero carbon footprint cement clinker through a cement-processing technique that replaces limestone with carbon-free volcanic rocks and mimics how fibrous microstructures effectively reinforce rocks.

Stanford University,Blood test predicts insulin resistance using an iPSC (induced pluripotent stem cell) model,Docket #: S19-145,Published Application: WO2021021649,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/blood-test-predicts-insulin-resistance-using-ipsc-induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-model,"Stanford researchers have formulated a risk scoring calculator using a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model to accurately predict and calculate insulin resistance via a novel blood test.  This allows insight into potential critical early intervention of diabetic and cardiovascular events.   Since endothelial dysfunction precedes the onset of obstructive coronary disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has a strong correlation with cardiovascular disease, inventors studied the patient-specific molecular signatures of iPSC-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs).  With this vital information, more precise and targeted clinical management is possible before complications (such as endothelial dysfunction and subsequent atherosclerosis) arise. \nPhenotypic differences in iPSC-ECs are likely due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and not the environment.  Hence, this method predicts the risk of developing insulin resistance through genetics alone.  For example, South Asians have a higher prevalence of insulin resistance, diabetes and cardiovascular disease when compared to Europeans of similar age.  Data from the U.K. with European and South Asians with similar Western diet and lifestyle suggested a genetic predisposition.\nSeveral critical challenges were solved by this discovery.  First, this system was proven to be easier to use, less invasive, and less cumbersome with more predictive value compared to current methods.  Secondly, the invention fulfills a large unmet medical need as the cause of insulin resistance and how it impacts the vascular system is not fully understood and there is a dire need for early diagnostic strategies.  Finally, there are limited drug therapies available.  Diet, exercise and anti-diabetic medications are currently the only evidence-based therapies for insulin resistance.  Research into SNPs will provide further insight into novel drug therapies and can act as a platform for future discoveries.\nThe expansive number of individuals this risk scoring calculator may reach is astounding.  According to Medscape, T2DM rates have quadrupled worldwide since 1980.  Moreover, the World Health Organization (WHO) states that 17.9 million people die each year from cardiovascular disease, an estimated 31% of all deaths in the world.  This innovative framework can very well prevent the emergence of an imminent health crisis.\nStage of Development:\nInventors measured the levels of one or more insulin resistance biomarkers from iPSCs derived from somatic cells of the individual.  These iPSCs were differentiated into iPSC-ECs.  Then, researchers determined whether the iPSC-ECs obtained from a patient were insulin-resistant or insulin-sensitive.\nFurther ongoing research may be dedicated to the identification and characterization of SNPs that cause insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease, thus refining even more accurate and precise risk calculators.\n\nApplications: Early and novel therapeutic and diagnostic strategies for diabetes and cardiovascular disease patients.\n\nAdvantages: Easier clinical use, less invasive, less cumbersome and more predictive value compared to current methods, The gold standard in research, euglycemic insulin clamp, is unwieldy in a clinical setting, The oral glucose challenge and Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) are also time consuming and not as accurate as the euglycemic clamp, Current tests require an individual to manifest insulin resistance, Prevents significant morbidity and mortality, Hones-in on genetic makeup."

This retinal prosthesis prototype vastly improved visual sequencing compared to other types on the market by using a closed-loop device with a greedy dictionary-based encoding system.  Discovery of this system allowed precise and realistic selection of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) electrical stimulation patterns in the eye.  This is a critical step in artificial vision as RGC's (20 different types) are directly degraded in individuals with loss of vision and has been historically impossible to simulate with any accuracy in a retinal prosthesis until now.\nResearchers first developed a realistic model of visual perception, then utilized the electrical stimulation and recordings to create calibrated dictionaries of RGC activity patterns with the device.

This low-energy cost memory is based on stacking orders in the atomically thin limit, associated with tiny changes in the position of one atomic layer with respect to another. Development of this kind of ultracompact memory with faster operation speed and smaller energy consumption is critical – it is estimated that global data volume will reach 44 zettabytes by 2020 and exceed the capabilities of current computing and memory devices. To achieve such orders of improvement in memory devices, it is essential to realize new operation mechanisms and to store information by nonclassical carriers. The new memory, called Berry curvature memory, is enabled by electrically driven stacking transitions with low-energy cost in nanometer-thick layered materials. It stores non-volatile information in a quantum geometrical property known as Berry curvature. The energy cost of such memory can be fundamentally as low as 0.1aJ/nm2, which is 3-5 orders smaller than that in current DRAM and GST-phase change memory and is not limited by thermal losses.

Stanford University,A new method for prioritizing non-coding genetic variants associated with complex diseases,Docket #: S20-212,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/new-method-prioritizing-non-coding-genetic-variants-associated-complex-diseases,"Because 98% of the genome does not code for a protein, unraveling how non-coding genetic variants contribute to complex diseases remains a great challenge. Stanford researchers have developed a novel method that prioritizes and assesses the functionality of non-coding genetic variants. This technology improves upon currently available methods in several ways.\nThe current gold standard to prioritize genetic variants such as the CADD score is based on evolutionary conservation and works well for coding variants. However, it is poorly suited for prioritizing non-coding variants. This new method is specifically designed to prioritize non-coding variants by integrating multiple annotations and metrics. It relies on an approach that is based on the biology of the specific cell type of interest rather than evolutionary conservation, and therefore able to prioritize genetic variants that are not evolutionarily conserved and common within the population, both of which have previously been overlooked.\nFurthermore, for a given cell type, the algorithm appropriately assigns the non-coding variants to their gene targets by identifying the genes they are in close physical proximity with based on three-dimensional chromatin conformation. It also associates the non-coding variant with a regulatory element known to be present at the site of the target gene in the cell, thereby offering a proposed method of action by which the non-coding variant regulates expression of its target gene.\nOverall, this technology provides a novel solution for identifying non-coding variants involved in complex diseases and advances the ability to interpret non-coding variants for personalized health care.\n\nApplications: Diagnostics, Identification and prioritization of genetic variants for molecular diagnosis of inherited diseases, Recognition of risk factors in healthy individuals, Research, Identification of genetic targets for research on pathophysiology of inherited diseases, Prediction of the functionality of genetic variants.\n\nAdvantages: A platform that integrates multiple sources of prior information in defining genetic variants and phenotype associations, Higher sensitivity and specificity in prioritizing non-coding risk variants than existing methods, Annotation can be cell-type specific and predicts mechanism of action of the non-coding variants."

Typically, neuromodulation and neurofeedback serve different, complementary therapeutic purposes. Using neuromodulation as neurofeedback - instead of providing a simple reward signal - boosts the complimentary effects of both treatment approaches.\nTo this end, delivery of neuromodulation therapy is modulated/triggered by neurofeedback, where the amount of neuromodulation therapy (e.g. the stimulation duration) can be adapted to the performance of the neurofeedback (e.g. the extent of the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) increase). The goal of this treatment is to mutually boost complementary therapeutic effects of neurofeedback training and neuromodulation, in this way inducing sustained, long-lasting therapeutic effects that outlast cessation of stimulation, so that a few hours of stimulation delivered regularly or occasionally may provide substantial relief.\nFigure\nSchematic illustrating neuromodulation triggered and modulated by neurofeedback. Whenever a target EEG feature, e.g. increased SMR amplitude, is detected in a time window of pre-defined length, a neuromodulation therapy session is triggered.

Stanford University,RASER – a synthetic system for targeting therapy to tumors with hyperactive signaling,Docket #: S17-233,"Published Application: 20190024070, Published Application: 20190256833, Issued: 11,939,609 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/raser-synthetic-system-targeting-therapy-tumors-hyperactive-signaling,"Researchers in Prof. Michael Lin's laboratory have developed a viral-based cancer therapy platform that could be used for targeting treatment to cancer cells with aberrant signaling in EGFR or HER2 pathways. A large fraction of solid tumors, especially breast, colorectal, head and neck, brain and lung cancers are driven by constitutively active signaling that promotes cell growth, proliferation or survival. Conventional anti-cancer drugs interfere with this signaling by directly interacting with one or more proteins in the pathway, acting on both oncogenic and healthy cells indiscriminately. This can lead to toxic side effects and drug resistance. To circumvent these issues, RASER (Rewiring of Aberrant Signaling to Effector Release) creates a synthetic pathway with a two-component system that uses cell signaling as a trigger rather than a target.\nBriefly, RASER consists of a cytosolic component and a membrane-tethered component. Hyperactive EGFR or HER2 signaling induces interaction between the two RASER components, causing release of a cargo from the membrane-tethered component. The cargo can be customized to either kill the oncogenic cell or induce a transcriptional response. For effectors that are pro-apoptotic proteins, the net effect of the treatment is selective apoptosis in cells with oncogenic levels of EGFR or HER2 signaling. For effectors that are Cas9-based transcriptional activators, the net effect is upregulation of genes of choice, such as immunostimulatory genes, in cells with oncogenic levels of EGFR or HER2 signaling. The basic modular platform can be programmed and personalized to detect different signaling pathways with different sensor elements and/or induce a variety of outputs with different effector elements (e.g., direct induction of apoptosis, transcription of apoptosis-inducing genes, gene editing).\nFigure legend: Killing of EGFR-mutant cancer cells by RASER virus infection. Top row, no virus. Middle row, caspase-3 reporter shows apoptosis in H1975 and LN-229:EGFRvIII, cancer cells with hyperactive EGFR, but not MCF-7 cells, which are not dependent on EGFR or HER2. Bottom row, direct fluorescence of orange fluorescent protein mKO2 fused to apoptotic cargo Bid BH3.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have demonstrated proof-of-principle of the two-component ErbB-RASER system in vitro.  In these studies, the sensing component was sensitive and specific to constitutive ErbB signal, activating a HCV NS3 protease to induce programmed responses from a range of effector components. The specific effector components tested were Bax (to activate BH3 pro-apoptotic proteins), FoxO (to activate pro-apoptotic transcription factors) and Cas9.\n\nApplications: Cancer therapeutics - viral-based therapy to target tumors with hyperactive ErbB-family receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4).\n\nAdvantages: Personalized, targeted delivery:, RASER is designed so the therapeutic cargo is only released in cells with oncogenic levels of signaling, limiting impact on healthy cells, therapeutic agent is mobilized by a sensing component that can be programmed based on the specific overexpression profile of a patient's tumor, Decreased chance of resistance - RASER does not directly target proteins in a cell signaling pathway, therefore it avoids a common source of drug resistance from conventional therapies (i.e., mutations in the signaling protein that is being targeted by the drug), Generalized platform - modular components can be programmed to target overexpression from a range of tyrosine kinases, Standard vectors - compact constructs for each of the two components designed to be packaged into standard viral vectors."
Stanford University,Quantum Progress: Radiation-Free Creation and Patterning of Color Centers,Docket #: S17-334,Published Application: WO2020096839,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/quantum-progress-radiation-free-creation-and-patterning-color-centers,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a non-destructive method for generating and patterning optical color centers with nanoscale resolution without the need for high energy radiation. Color centers, which are optically active defects within the lattice structure of a host material, are exciting candidate qubits for quantum technology as well as sensing applications down to the single-molecule level. However, two key challenges hindering the mass adoption of optical color centers are poor material quality and lack of methods to control qubit spatial distributions. Existing fabrication methods rely on destructive, high energy irradiation. Hence, color center generation and patterning remains a key bottleneck to progress in the field.\nThe new method is based on depositing, treating, and annealing functional 'vacancy injection' films on relevant materials (e.g., diamond, silicon carbide, silicon). This non-destructive approach enables a higher level of control and decreases host lattice damage. In sharp contrast to previous methods, the vacancies in host materials are not generated by irradiation but rather via lithographically patternable vacancy-injection film disposed on the host material. When exposed to elevated temperatures, the film absorbs substrate atoms, thereby realizing vacancies in the lattice of the host material.\nStage of Development\nThe researchers have demonstrated vacancy doping in diamond using the new approach. They have also shown the ability to pattern color centers on the nanoscale using conventional photolithography to pattern film deposition.\n\nApplications: Forming and patterning color centers, Quantum computing, quantum sensors (e.g., temperature, magnetic, electric field, optical near field, etc.), quantum imagers, super-resolution microscopy and more.\n\nAdvantages: Less destructive; method does not rely on high energy radiation, Much greater spatial control."

AquaROS, a novel and broad-spectrum disinfectant, is based on the formation of micron-sized water droplets that cause the spontaneous generation of highly reactive oxidant species (ROS). Access to safe and effective disinfecting solutions like AquaROS is more critical than ever – in the U.S. approximately the same number of people die from healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) as from AIDS, breast cancer and auto accidents combined. Inexpensively produced by atomizing water, the new disinfectant has been shown to outperform other commercial methods at inactivating Salmonella typhimurium and E. coli.

CLC-2 is part of the CLC family of chloride ion channels, which regulate the flux of chloride ions across cell membranes. These proteins play critical roles in electrical signaling of muscles and neurons and in maintaining proper water and salt balance throughout the body. Existing classes of CLC inhibitors have been poor drug candidates, as they lack isoform selectivity and have low potency against their intended targets.\nTo address this problem, Stanford researchers have developed a low-nanomolar potency (14 nM), small-molecule inhibitor of the CLC-2 chloride channel with demonstrated specificity for its target within the central nervous system (CNS). Specificity has been validated with a genetic knockout model, as well as through screening against a panel common CNS channels, receptors, and transporters.

This includes disrupting the related interaction of basic amino acid PIP2 pincer (BAAPP) domain with PIP2. Many cancers rely on PI4-kinase (PI4K) signaling for proliferation and metastasis. Thus, this technology is a source of therapeutic candidates against cancers associated with PI4K. Likewise, it can serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral or antimicrobial. Pathogens which rely on PI4K or BAAPP-PIP2 can be neutralized and its replication abrogated.  Although this class of compounds has been terminated in preclinical development by multiple big pharma companies due to severe toxicity associated with inhibiting PI4K in vivo, the researchers believe there could be a therapeutic window in some clinical scenarios, including HCV, plasmodium, and ebola virus. These could also be useful tool compounds to study the mechanism of in vivo toxicity associated with PI4K inhibition.\n\nApplications: Pharmacologic antagonists of PI4-kinase in the treatment of cancer or metastasis, Broad-spectrum antiviral or antimicrobial for pathogens involving PI4K or BAAPP-PIP2.\n\nAdvantages: High potency against PI4K and related proteins, Demonstrated improved efficacy and selectivity over previously reported PI4K inhibitors."

The researchers' experimental mouse models indicate that thrombin cleavage of OPN plays a critical role in the growth and progression of B16 melanoma in vivo.\nFigure\nStage of Development\nMouse studies elucidating the role of thrombin cleavage of osteopontin (OPN) in the pathology of inflammatory disorders and cancers. Specifically, the growth of B16 melanoma cells is suppressed in OPN knock-out (KO) mice. In summary, the data show that thrombin cleavage of OPN is critical for tumor growth and therefore targeting thrombin cleavage of OPN and cleaved OPN fragments provides a legitimate approach in regulating cancer progression and survival.\n\nApplications: Treatment of melanoma and other cancers, either as a monotherapy or in combination, Treatment of inflammatory disorders.\n\nAdvantages: Similarly reduced tumor growth in KO and KI mice shows, for the first time, the pathophysiological importance of thrombin cleavage of OPN."

Stanford University,Microbial Batteries Produce Energy from Wastewater and Other Organic Matter,Docket #: S12-308,"Published Application: WO2014055671, Issued: 9,509,028 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/microbial-batteries-produce-energy-wastewater-and-other-organic-matter,"An interdisciplinary team of Stanford engineers have developed a low-cost, patented, in situ method to efficiently produce electricity from organic matter such as wastewater. This microbial battery (MB) employs an anode coated with exoelectrogenic microbes that can ingest organic waste to produce excess electrons. The electrons travel to a solid state cathode which can be removed from the MB to release the electrons and recharge. The simple, membrane-free design lowers the cost and avoids oxygen diffusion.\nOverall, the MB has high energy recovery efficiency, high power output and low capital costs. In addition, it avoids the odor, safety and environmental risks inherent in bioreactors that produce methane. This technology could be particularly useful for in situ removal of hydrocarbon deposits in sediment or for decentralized treatment of wastewater. The system could effectively offset the electricity now used to treat wastewater – currently estimated at 3% of the total electrical load in developed nations.\nSchematic of the microbial battery (MB) equipped with a Prussian Blue (PB) cathode. The microbial anode produces electrons from organic matter. The electrons flow to the PB electrode that functions as a cathode and is reduced. When exposed to oxygen in air, the reduced PB is re-oxidized.\nStage of Development\nThe inventors have built prototype microbial batteries and demonstrated their efficiency. Initial tests were performed with a silver cathode which achieved efficiency of electrical energy conversion of 44-49% glucose and 22-38% for real domestic wastewater. In subsequent testing with a lower cost Prussian Blue cathode, they demonstrated 85% charge transfer, with net energy recovery efficiency ~30%  (exceeds MFC) with no loss of capacity over 20 cycles of operation.\n\nApplications: Biofuel/alternative energy - in situ energy extraction from a range of organic sources, such as:, wastewater, hydrocarbon and decaying biomass in sediments or landfills, organic pollutants in dead zones of lakes and coastal waters, methane deposits in the subsurface and deep ocean.\n\nAdvantages: High efficiency energy recovery:, ~20-40% with MB compared to ~4% for conventional bioreactor and microbial fuel cell technology, direct conversion of chemical energy into electricity, No hazardous biogas - avoids safety, odor and environmental impact concerns of bioreactors that produce methane, In situ operation:, can convert organic matter in low concentrations and in hard to access locations, positioning MB within wells to access subsurface deposits enables carbon dioxide to be released, neutralized and sequestered at depth, Simple, membrane-free design - compared to microbial fuel cells which rely on a membrane, MB's have:, higher power output, lower cost, reduced oxygen diffusion."

Stanford University,Metabolites Delay Retinal Degeneration,Docket #: S18-556,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/metabolites-delay-retinal-degeneration,"Stanford researchers have discovered that dietary metabolites, specifically alpha-ketoglutarate, are able to delay retinal degeneration to treat blinding retinal diseases regardless of the type of retinal condition.   Scientists found these metabolites were able to slow down retinal degeneration through a common pathway, independent of gene mutations (approximately 200 known genes involving retinal degeneration) to help delay vision loss for millions of patients.  One prime example is Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), the most common cause of hereditary blindness in developed countries for which there is no available therapy.\nResearchers used proteomics to identify metabolic pathways that were affected during retinal degeneration in mice and found that oral delivery of alpha-ketoglutarate was shown to provide significant visual rescue of the rods, cones, and inner retina through at least one month of age in a preclinical model of RP (retinitis pigmentosa).  Further, dietary supplementation with B vitamins and a ketogenic diet was found to improve photoreceptor cell survival in some cases.\nThis discovery has the potential to address an unmet clinical need to treat retinal degeneration disorders such as, but not limited to retinitis pigmentosa, Usher syndrome, Alport's syndrome, Kearns-Sayre, abetalipoproteinemia, McLeod syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, neurosyphilis, toxoplasmosis and Refsum's disease.  Continued research to test additional metabolite derivatives including delivery and dosing methods will refine therapeutics to target ocular disease.\nFigure\nFigure explanation: Oral delivery of alpha-ketoglutarate rescues visual function and photoreceptor cell survival in a preclinical model of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP).

Stanford University,Improved Anomaly Detection Using Adversarially Learned Inference,Docket #: S19-208,Published Application: 20200410285,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/improved-anomaly-detection-using-adversarially-learned-inference,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a potentially best-in-class anomaly detection method with a wide range of applications. Anomaly detection is the identi?cation of abnormal events, items or data, and is used in many ?elds such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis and network intrusion detection. Existing methods focus on modelling the distribution of normal data provided during training. However, this does not necessarily ensure the correct detection of anomalous data (false positive). The researchers propose a new Generative Adversarial Network with anomaly augmentation (GANAA) in which deep neural networks are adversarially trained to better recognize samples from an anomaly distribution. This approach is based on a new de?nition of the loss function and novel use of discriminator networks.\nFigure\nFigure description:\nResults on three synthetic datasets: """"loop,"""" """"arc"""" and """"four-dot."""" The ?rst row shows samples of normal data. The second and third row show the output probability of discriminators in GANAA and another method called ALAD, respectively. (ALAD is Adversarially Learned Anomaly Detection). These plots show the clear distinction between normal and abnormal sets with GANAA. ALAD's prediction is much fuzzier.\nStage of Development\nMathematical proofs show that this approach has stronger guarantees for detecting anomalous examples compared to the current state of the art. Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic data show that the new model leads to signi?cant and consistent improvements on previous anomaly detection benchmarks. This includes significant advantages over state-of-the-art anomaly detection using three data sets (network intrusion, arrhythmia, and thyroid).\n\nApplications: Anomaly detection, Cyber security, intrusion detection, surveillance, manufacturing, factory assembly line, quality control, medical diagnostics, chemical and physical processes control, audits and monitoring.\n\nAdvantages: Significantly improves ability to differentiate between normal and abnormal data and reduce false positives, Shown to outperform current state of the art anomaly detection methods."
Stanford University,Combinatorial Antibody Blockade of IL6 and PD-1/CD47 as Lung Fibrosis Treatment and Adjunct Cancer Immunotherapy,Docket #: S19-434,Published Application: 20220411500,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/combinatorial-antibody-blockade-il6-and-pd-1cd47-lung-fibrosis-treatment-and-adjunct,"Technology summary\nJUN has a critical role in regulating fibrosis through immune checkpoints such as PD-1/CD47. Immune checkpoints are upregulated by activated JUN in fibrotic tissue, leading to an immunosuppressive environment and further pathogenesis. The suppression of immune cells by activated JUN is further amplified by IL6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine often produced by pathologic fibroblasts. Thus, dual inhibition of IL6 and PD-1/CD47 relieves the subdued innate immunity of the host and can even reverse damage in fibrotic tissue. This has significant potential as a synergistic treatment for fibrotic diseases like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and Covid-19 as well.\nStage of Development\nIn vivo, preclinical models of fibrotic diseases and graft-versus-host disease.\n\nApplications: Treatment of fibrotic diseases (e.g. pulmonary fibrosis, radiation fibrosis, liver fibrosis, kidney fibrosis, skin fibrosis), graft-versus-host disease and Covid-19, Adjuvant cancer therapy with dual blockade of IL6 and immune checkpoint.\n\nAdvantages: Synergism of checkpoint blockade, PD-1/CD47, and IL6 blockade, JUN could be used as a prognostic biomarker."

It is very challenging to study small objects (1um to 1mm) that move great distances (hundreds of meters) because it is difficult to bridge the vast difference in scales between the observed object and the observation volume.  Current optical tracking systems are non-ideal as they are large, complicated, expensive and cannot accommodate the full range of expected motion.\nTo overcome these limitations the inventors have developed a hydrodynamic treadmill for a tracking microscope that effectively provides unlimited space for vertical motion.  It allows micro/mesoscale (1um to1mm) biotic and abiotic systems to be tracked and observed under the influence of hydrodynamic forces and a gravitational field.  The system allows for observations over extensive time (tens of hours) and long length scale (hundreds of meters). This technology provides a method to bridge the difference in scales and enable the observation of really small entities over great distances.\n\nApplications: Research tool for:, Marine ecology, biological oceanography and physical oceanography, Tracking marine microorganisms, Atmospheric sciences, Observing sedimenting microparticles and microdroplets, Material sciences, Observing the growth of microcrystals, Cell biology, Tracking circulating cells, Pharmacology, Drug development and screening, Fluid mechanics and transport phenomenon.\n\nAdvantages: Solves an unmet need by providing the means to study microscale objects over macroscale lengths and time periods, System can accommodate ecologically relevant variations in the environment, such as light, temperature, nutrient concentration, salt concentration and chemoattractants, Enables the study of uniform flow past micro/mesoscale objects that rise/sink in an ambient fluid, Objects under study have the freedom to move great distances, Observations can be made over long time periods (tens of hours), System is compact, System may be integrated seamlessly with conventional microscopes as a replacement tracking stage."

This method is much simpler since it does not add additional passive components, nor require the design of the resonant network.\nWBG power semiconductors can be applied to many high-frequency and high-power applications, such as wireless power transfer applications and radio-frequency plasma generations.  Because of the reduction in device gate loss, researchers can apply higher current through the device with the same thermal limit, which increases the power density of the power electronics system.\nFigure\nFigure description - Schematic of cascode GaN/SiC power device\nStage of Development\n\nApplications: High frequency and high-power applications such as wireless power transfer and radio-frequency plasma generations.\n\nAdvantages: Combines the advantages of both a GaN and an SiC device, Enables wider deployment of WBG semiconductors, More simple and efficient design to reduce gate loss  – does not require resonant gate drivers which add components and complexity in current solutions., Lower gate loss  enables smaller, faster and more efficient high-power density electronics."
Stanford University,Next Generation Therapy for Heart Failure: Mediated Mitochondrial Transplantation,Docket #: S19-110,Published Application: WO2020232301,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/next-generation-therapy-heart-failure-mediated-mitochondrial-transplantation,"Researchers at Stanford are advancing a new treatment for heart failure based on the transfer of mitochondria-rich extracellular vesicles from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Heart failure is the leading cause of hospital admission in the U.S. and the 5-year survival is still a dismal 50%. Key to heart failure is the imbalance between energy supply and demand. Current therapeutics attempt to correct this imbalance by reducing cardiac workload, but they do not target the primary energy source of the failing heart. Needed is an innovative therapy for cardiac disorders that targets intracellular bioenergetics directly. The new approach is based on the researchers' discovery that the induced cardiomyocytes (iCM) released mitochondria-positive extracellular vesicles (EV) that improved mitochondrial function and even restored the bioenergetics of recipient cardiomyocytes. This approach could solve many of the challenges of mitochondria transplantation and advance the current therapeutic regimen for patients.\n(schematic) Treating heart failure by transferring mitochondria derived from the patient's own stem cells back into the cells of the damaged heart muscle\nStage of Development\nIntra-myocardial injection of mitochondria-rich EVs enhanced survival of hypoxia-injured iCMs in vitro and improved ventricular function and attenuated cardiac remodeling of ischemia-injured murine myocardium in vivo.\n\nApplications: Therapeutic for bioenergetic imbalance in heart failure, Treatment for hypertrophic, arrythymogenic right ventricular, dilated, restrictive, and ischemic cardiomyopathy.\n\nAdvantages: Currently, clinical use of isolated mitochondria to treat heart failure is extremely challenging, EV-mediated transfer of mitochondria can address key challenges, Mitochondria inside EVs are protective, preventing calcium overload when compared to isolated mitochondria, The lipid bilayer structure of the EVs prevents calcium ions from diffusing into the vesicles, EVs are internalized by recipient cells through rapid fusion with cell membrane, resulting in direct release of the mitochondrial content into the cytoplasm, The EVs facilitate quick transfer of EVs-mitochondria into recipient iCM. By contrast, isolated mitochondria were rarely internalized by recipient iCM within 24 hours., The transferred mitochondria integrated with host mitochondria and increased ATP level within three hours."
Stanford University,Improved genetic risk model for predicting and subtyping disease,Docket #: S19-332,"Published Application: 20210065846, Issued: 12,100,480 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/improved-genetic-risk-model-predicting-and-subtyping-disease,"Researchers at Stanford have developed the first polygenic risk model of its kind for estimating personalized genetic risk profiles. No other genetic model is able to identify biological drivers of disease risk and generate disease subtypes.\nWhile many versions of polygenic risk scores (PRS) have been developed and used with some success to identify individuals at high risk for diseases like cancer and obesity, current methods are inadequate. This is because simple linear models can effectively predict outcomes but do not generally account for disease subtypes or pathways.\nIn contrast, the new model is based on latent trait-related genetic components. Each component has genetic determinants which can be expressed as a component PRS. This innovative """"palette"""" approach breaks down genetic risk into its constituent pathways, and may better describe the clinical manifestations of complex disease.\nStage of Development\nBased on a test set of more than 67,000 individuals from UK Biobank, the researchers found that the most at-risk individuals (2% percentile) have 2.5-kg/m2 higher Body Mass Index, 3.5-fold risk of myocardial infarction, and 4.8-fold risk for gout compared to the general population.

Stanford University,AN OXYGEN-GENERATING COLLAGEN-BASED CRYOGEL BIOSCAFFOLD FOR PANCREATIC ISLET TRANSPLANTATION,Docket #: S18-259,Published Application: WO2020232008,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/oxygen-generating-collagen-based-cryogel-bioscaffold-pancreatic-islet-transplantation,"Researchers at Stanford have developed an oxygen-generating, collagen-based cryogel bioscaffold to improve islet cell transplantation for the treatment of diabetes.  Type 1 diabetes, which affects millions of people, is currently treated by daily injection of insulin.  This treatment is effective, but it can only keep blood glucose levels within a broad range and does not allow dynamic response to changes in glucose levels.  Tight control of glucose levels significantly reduces the occurrence of secondary complications such as renal failure, heart disease and blindness.  Thus, it would be highly beneficial to develop a diabetes treatment that restores glucose control in an automated and self-regulating manner.  One such attempt is pancreatic islet cell transplantation.  This approach, however, is not yet clinically useful as 50-70% of the transplanted islet cells die during the first week due to lack of oxygen.  (It takes 2-3 weeks for transplanted islets to establish their own blood supply.)  To help overcome this challenge the inventors developed this oxygen-generating, collagen-based cryogel bioscaffold.  The bioscaffold generates oxygen and thus serves as a bridge for islet survival until they can generate their own microcirculation for long term oxygen delivery.  This bioscaffold has the potential to improve islet cell transplantation and diabetes treatment as it provides a suitable 3D microenvironment for islets and can generate oxygen to facilitate islet survival following transplantation, and can serve as a """"platform technology"""" for any cellular therapy that can be added as cargo.\nBioscaffold (Image credit: Thakor Lab)\nStage of development – In vivo testing\nUsing a diabetic mouse model, the inventors have shown that their new bioscaffold promotes islet viability and function.\n\nApplications: Islet cell transplantation for treatment of diabetes, Cellular therapy – suitable for any cellular therapy that can be added as cargo to the bioscaffold.\n\nAdvantages: First time oxygen generating bioscaffold based on a natural polymer has been generated for islet transplantation, High degree of porosity-, Good for nutrient and oxygen transfer, Prevents islet aggregation, Big pores to facilitate retention of islets and smaller pores to promote blood vessel ingrowth, Bioscaffold is soft and pliable- can be compressed to a fraction of its original shape before returning to its original shape, Biocompatible, Improves chance of islet transplantation success."

This technology employs a highly selective electrocatalyst to produce ammonia and ammonium nitrate from recycled waste nitrates using water as a hydrogen source. This could reduce both production and distribution costs because does not rely on the standard Haber-Bosch process (which currently requires over 1 % of the entire global energy supply and 3-5 % of the natural gas supply for pre-requisite hydrogen production). On-site, low volume production of fertilizer also maximizes nitrogen utilization efficiency. Furthermore, the process can be directly coupled to renewable electricity to further lower environmental impact. Ammonia produced with this technology could be used as a chemical precursor, exploited as a fuel alternative or directly converted into fertilizer for agricultural use.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have demonstrated that a titanium electrocatalyst for this reaction can achieve over 80% faradic efficiency toward ammonia. They are planning to develop a prototype.\n\nApplications: Electrocatalytic ammonia and ammonium nitrate production from water and nitrate for use as:, fertilizer, fuel alternative for energy storage from intermittent renewable sources (wind, solar, etc.), chemical precursor to many nitrogen-containing chemicals (e.g., hydrazine, nitrous oxide and nitric acid).\n\nAdvantages: Energy efficient - uses water rather than molecular hydrogen as a hydrogen source for the reaction, which could reduce overall fossil fuel and energy consumption for ammonia synthesis, Environmentally friendly:, converts waste (nitrate runoff) into useful product (ammonia or ammonium nitrate), can be directly integrated with wastewater treatment (nitrate salt capture and concentration) technologies currently under development for water purification, can be coupled with renewable energy to lower carbon dioxide emissions, Localized production - does not require large, centralized plants, enabling on-site production of ammonia and fertilizer:, lowers distribution costs, increases utilization efficiency when fertilizer can be directly applied to crops, allows end-users to control their own supply, Lower cost infrastructure - could operate at significantly lower pressures than the Haber-Bosch, potentially lowering equipment and operational costs."

This new endonuclease system uses viral-specific guide RNAs to treat an infection by destroying one of the remaining viral targets - the viral genome itself. This technology can be adapted with a range of specific guide RNAs and/or delivery methods which could lead to a generalized approach for curing latent viral infections (such as herpesviridae and human papillomavirus).\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have demonstrated this system in cells of patients with Burkitt's lymphoma that were infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV or human herpesvirus 4). The CRISPR/Cas9 system suppressed virally induced cell proliferation, restored the apoptosis pathway in the cells and completely cleared EBV from ~25% of the cells with no toxic side-effects to noninfected cells.\n\nApplications: Anti-viral therapy - eliminate virus from the host cells with CRISPR/Cas9 endonuclease and viral specific guide RNAs, particularly for latent viruses such as herpesviridae (including Epstein-Barr virus) and human papillomavirus (HPV).\n\nAdvantages: Unmet medical need - current anti-viral therapies cannot eradicate latent viruses, First in class approach - this technology directly attacks the viral genome (compared with standard antiviral therapies that target proteins) which is particularly useful for latent viral infections where protein production is extremely low, Fast and easy design of viral specific guide RNA to develop therapeutic candidates with different disease targets."

Stanford University,Use of annexin V to prevent the spread of Listeria,Docket #: S17-179,"Published Application: 20190008922, Published Application: WO20170202914, Issued: 10,874,711 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/use-annexin-v-prevent-spread-listeria,"Dr. Francis Blankenberg has developed a method to prevent the spread of Listeria and other obligate intracellular pathogens, including mycobacterium marinum, chlamydia trachomatis and parasitic infections. These pathogens share a common mechanism of cell to cell spread- they envelope themselves with membranes containing high levels of phosphatidylserine (PS) to evade recognition and attack by the host immune system.  The effectiveness of the PS+membrane envelope system has made it difficult to effectively treat these infections.  To overcome this difficulty the inventor has developed methods of using annexin V, a high affinity PS binding protein, to treat these infections.  Annexin V can block the entry and immunosuppressive effects of pathogens which rely on PS-mediated mechanisms for infection.  This technology provides methods to more effectively treat infection by Listeria, mycobacterium marinum, chlamydia trachomatis and parasites.\nStage of research\nProof-of-concept experiments using a murine listeria model have been performed and show great promise.\n\nApplications: Treat infection by Listeria and other obligate pathogens, Prevent further spread, Promote effective immune response, Treat drug resistant parasitic pathogens including:, Leishmania, Trypanosoma cruzi, Toxoplasma gondii, Boost vaccine efficacy in promoting an effective immune response to these pathogens.\n\nAdvantages: Solves a medical need- potential to provide effective treatment for Listeria and other obligate intracellular bacterial and parasitic infections, Safe immunotherapeutic agent:, Not antigenic, Not associated with allergic reaction, Can be used in combination with other therapeutics, Can be radiolabeled and used as a radiotracer to guide treatment."

This system includes fuzzy extractor algorithms to generate unique, reproducible, error-tolerant location signatures (“geotags”).  These algorithms allow the geotags to be calibrated and verified even when there is noisy location data – such as when Loran stations are offline or when Wi-Fi access points relocate.  The system can be applied to time and location-based parameters extracted from a range of signal sources to provide an additional layer of assurance to traditional security systems.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors implemented algorithms in MATLAB and the performance has been tested using real RF signals from Loran and Wi-Fi.\n\nApplications: Geo-security/Location-based security - position and/or time parameters to implement features such as:\n\nData access control – to prevent access to location-aware disk drives outside of designated data center\nDigital Manners Policies (DMP), Data access control – to prevent access to location-aware disk drives outside of designated data center, Digital Manners Policies (DMP), Indoor positioning.\n\nAdvantages: Robust, reproducible tags:\n\nfour-dimensional discriminating tags (3-D spatial and 1-D temporal) from multiple signal sources lower both false rejection and false acceptance rates\nLoran and WiFi signals can reach dense urban or indoor environments where line-of-sight signals such as GPS are not available\na combination of different fuzzy extractor algorithms are used to compensate for different sources of noise in location signals, four-dimensional discriminating tags (3-D spatial and 1-D temporal) from multiple signal sources lower both false rejection and false acceptance rates, Loran and WiFi signals can reach dense urban or indoor environments where line-of-sight signals such as GPS are not available, a combination of different fuzzy extractor algorithms are used to compensate for different sources of noise in location signals, Efficient:\n\nthe fuzzy extractor algorithms can be easily implemented in either hardware and software and require low computational time and storage space\nno time synchronization or blending algorithms are need to integrate signal information from different sources, the fuzzy extractor algorithms can be easily implemented in either hardware and software and require low computational time and storage space, no time synchronization or blending algorithms are need to integrate signal information from different sources, One-way - fuzzy extractors do not reveal information of the original inputs and the system does not need to convert location-dependent parameters into a physical location estimate, Secure, unpredictable tags - attackers would not be able to predict location parameters for tags because buildings, walls, moving objects, and environments introduce sufficient randomness to the parameters, Range of signal types - the system can be applied to a variety of RF signals (such as Loran, Wi-Fi, TV, and cellular) as well as non-RF signals (such as infrared and ultrasound)."
Stanford University,Automated analysis pipeline for identifying immunogenic neo-antigens from next generation sequencing data from patients,Docket #: S16-309,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/automated-analysis-pipeline-identifying-immunogenic-neo-antigens-next-generation,"Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy and sequencing technologies have created promising opportunities for precision cancer medicine. The biology underlying ohow endogenous T cells recognize and destroy the cancer cells is complex and under active investigation, but one fundamental step involves T-cell recognition of peptide epitopes that are presented on major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) on the surface of tumor cells but not in normal cells. Somatic mutations in cancer genomes produce amino acid alterations that can generate new immunogenic peptides, frequently called neoantigens. Tumor mutation burden, and, even more specifically, neoantigen load have been correlated with strength of T-cell reactivity, response to immunotherapy, and prognosis. Most often these mutations are unique to individual patients, and, thus, point to a personalized, precision medicine approach for using immunotherapy. This requires investigating and predicting the interactions between T cells and mutation-derived tumor neoantigens. Next generation sequencing technologies such as whole exome sequencing allow us to identify nonsynonymous mutations in the protein-coding portions of genes in cancer patients and predict potential neoantigens. The ideal neoantigen derived from genomics data has the following properties: i) nonsynonymous somatic mutation, ii) expressed in transcriptome data, iii) translated neopetide with strong binding affinity to patient's own MHC molecules, and iv) belong to larger/diverse subpopulation. Once found and validated, neoantigens can be used to help predict and potentially enhance checkpoint therapy response as well as to identify targets for the development of adoptive T cell therapies and therapeutic tumor vaccines. We developed an automatic pipeline with consensus approach to identify immunogenic neo-antigens based on genomic data. This software identifies and characterizes neoantigens as needed. While other technological pipelines are emerging, there is high variability in the methods used and studies on large human data sets are still lacking. Therefore, our system has been validated using quality control data sets. Overall, this software enables one to evaluate neoantigens from any individual tumor and consider the role of immunotherapy approaches using these results.\n\nApplications: Our pipeline can identify/prioritize the immunogenic neo-antigens for any cancer patients with DNA sequencing and RNA-Seq (milllions of sequence reads) using the generated results..\n\nAdvantages: Development of a fully integrated bioinformatics pipeline that includes all the necessary steps needed for neoantigen development. This can be run as a single command that implements all steps. Identification of whether a specific neoantigen is represented among quantitative fraction of tumors cells from a given patient.."

Stanford University,Reformulated Hospital Gentamicin Reduces Risk of Hearing Loss,Docket #: S19-051,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/reformulated-hospital-gentamicin-reduces-risk-hearing-loss,"Researchers at Stanford have developed reformulated hospital gentamicin that reduces the side effect risk of hearing loss while maintaining antimicrobial activity. Gentamicin, an antibiotic used to treat life- threatening infections, is the second most commonly administered drug in the NICU, frequently used as a first line treatment in neonatal intensive care. A subset of patients experience hearing loss following treatment (incidence estimates vary between 2-20%). For the first time, researchers tested the antimicrobial and ototoxic (ear damaging) potencies of each of the individual components of hospital gentamicin to develop a new formulation that has shown reduced ototoxic side effects in rat cochlea. As gentamicin is produced by fermentation, it is a variable mixture, made up of five major components. By precisely remixing the more beneficial and less toxic components, the new formulation offers a more potent but safer drug of known and consistent composition. The extremely low cost of gentamicin (~$2 / injection) allows for a margin of markup to recover the cost of producing this improved, life-saving drug.\nStage of Development\nIn vitro ototoxicity data has been collected on rat cochleae (the organ that is damaged when patients experience hearing loss). In vitro antimicrobial data collected to CSLI standard. Data collected on 40 strains of bacterial strains from four species: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherischia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The chemical purification pathways are already developed for at least gram level work.\n\nApplications: Replacement for existing hospital gentamicin with reduced ototoxic side effects.\n\nAdvantages: Lower toxicity profile for the ear, Formulation is suitable for straight-to-humans studies, Removes the most toxic as well as the least bactericidal components, Higher manufacturing cost would be offset by potency and safety, Can be produced in high volumes, with consistent composition."
Stanford University,New powerful electron microscopy imaging mode combining Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy,Docket #: S19-161,"Published Application: 20220268704, Issued: 11,994,472 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/new-powerful-electron-microscopy-imaging-mode-combining-raman-spectroscopy-and-electron,"Stanford researchers at the Dionne Lab have introduced new vibrational spectroscopy, termed electron- and light induced stimulated Raman (ELISR) scattering, in electron microscopy for simultaneous high-resolution chemical mapping of various samples. This new powerful electron microscopy imaging mode enables Raman spectral imaging with spatial resolution approaching that of the electron-beam and simultaneous light and electron beam imaging for perfect imaging correlation.  In addition, this imaging mode can be easily integrated with currently available transmission electron microscopes (TEMs), scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) and other instruments with electron beam imaging capabilities. Currently, there is no other technique that offers Raman spectral imaging in a TEM or SEM with the spatial resolution approaching that of the electron beam.\nThis new imaging mode can be used for label-free molecular and chemical mapping of biological and solid-state samples.  It can also be used to characterize optical and chemical processes at the nanoscale for photocatalysis and energy storage process among other crucial applications.\nFigure Description - The top panel shows a schematic of ELISR. In the absence of the electron beam excitation, the Raman scattering from all illuminated molecules contributes to the spectra, prohibiting spatial localization below the diffraction limit (black illustrative spectrum). When the electron beam excites the plasmonic mode of one of the nanoparticles, the Raman scattering from the surrounding molecules is significantly enhanced while the scattering from the other molecules around unexcited nanoparticle remain unchanged (blue illustrative curve). Therefore, the molecular composition of a sample can be mapped with nanometer resolution. Experimentally, the team uses an aberration corrected environmental transmission electron microscope (TEM) with optical coupling ability. Two parabolic mirrors are used to illuminate the sample with the laser pump and collected the Raman scattering through two optical fibers under simultaneous e-beam excitation.\n\nApplications: Mapping of cells (cancer cells, bacteria, neurons…etc.) and other biological samples, Characterize the local chemical composition of a variety of samples during electron imaging, including two-dimensional materials, polymeric blends and semiconductor devices., Study of photocatalysis and chemical reactions at the nanoscale.\n\nAdvantages: New features:, Sub-wavelength Raman imaging with combined optical and electron excitation, Simultaneous electron and stimulated Raman spectral imaging, High chemical sensitivity with atomic spatial resolution approaching that of the electron-beam, Easy implementation:, Can be integrated with current commercial systems, No specific labeling, Same sample preparation for electron microscopy imaging."

High precision LINAC commissioning data is crucial for the safe setup of new LINACs, verification of proper operation, continuing quality assurance, and as input to treatment planning software.  Current commissioning is a laborious process that lacks operational standards and commercial validation tools.  Stanford's fast and accurate method uses a few sampling points to generate accurate percentage depth dose (PDD) and depth dose profile (DDP) for the LINAC beam. It was developed and tested on three medical LINACs with 1000s of data points. This approach greatly simplifies the tedious linac commissioning procedure and provides a robust and safe way of introducing new LINACs into the clinic.\nStage of Development – Software Tool in use with Clinical LINAC\n\nApplications: LINAC commissioning, calibration and quality assurance verification, LINAC output predictions and verification, Radiation therapy treatment planning.\n\nAdvantages: Accurate, clinically sound, and reproducible generation of high precision data for LINAC commissioning - Both PDD and profiles were accurately predicted at different beam energies and field sizes with percentage relative error (pRE) of less than 0.8%, High accuracy in predicting small field output factors, Quicker and more efficient, Robust and safe."

Stanford University,Exploiting Spatial Degrees of Freedom in MIMO Cognitive Radio Systems,Docket #: S11-379,"Published Application: 20140126666, Published Application: WO2014018146, Issued: 9,344,162 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/exploiting-spatial-degrees-freedom-mimo-cognitive-radio-systems,"Stanford researchers have proposed two learning techniques for MIMO secondary users (SU) to spatially coexist with Primary Users (PU).  Today, most of the spectrum is allocated to primary users for exclusive use. The proposed techniques will enable additional secondary users to operate on these frequencies without interfering with licensed users. These techniques also provide a novel spatial division multiple access mechanism for equal-priority MIMO users sharing a common channel.\nThe advantage of both of the proposed algorithms is that they both can be implemented using only energy measurements. These measurements are independent of the transmission schemes of the secondary user and the primary user. Furthermore, an advantage of the first proposed algorithm, the Blind Null Space Learning (BNSL) algorithm, is that the secondary users do not need any cooperation from the primary users, i.e. the primary user is completely passive. The advantage of the second proposed algorithm, the Closed-Form Blind Null Space Learning (CF-BNSL), is reduced complexity over the first algorithm, at the expense of some minimal cooperation from the primary users. This minimal cooperation does not include extra measurements, or any handshake/synchronization with the primary users. In fact, the primary user does not even have to be aware of the secondary user.  The proposed techniques will enable the deployment of more wireless communication networks with higher data rates on the same frequencies and area as today.\nUpcoming 5G wireless networks are expected to have more antennas at both base stations and mobile terminals. These networks are also expected to have a large number of heterogeneous wireless access points. The need for increased spectral efficiency, as well for simple distributed interference mitigation schemes, makes the proposed techniques more poignant than ever for commercial systems.\nStage of Research:\nInterDigital Innovation Challenge\nThird place winner of the 2012 InterDigital Innovation Challenge\n\nApplications: Cognitive radios using MIMO technologies, Wireless systems as a multiple access technique.\n\nAdvantages: Allows secondary users (SU) to utilize primary's (PU's) spectrum with no or minimal cooperation from the side of the PU, Efficient use of electromagnetic spectrum to allow more wireless communication system at a higher data rate, Can be implemented using only energy measurements, Does not require special hardware, Applicable to many practical communication schemes."
Stanford University,Re-purposed combination therapies to improve outcomes in melanoma,Docket #: S17-102,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/re-purposed-combination-therapies-improve-outcomes-melanoma,"Melanoma is responsible for a disproportionate number of cancer deaths, with few effective treatment options for patients with advanced disease. Further, melanoma is prone to spontaneous mutation in response to treatment with a targeted therapy, such as a MEK or BRAF inhibitor, necessitating additional treatment courses.\nResearchers at Stanford have found that tumors with mutations in the protein osteopontin have improved outcomes- particularly if that mutation renders the protein resistant to cleavage by thrombin. The anti-cancer effect of the mutation can be replicated via treatment with a thrombin inhibitor, demonstrating the importance of the thrombin-osteopontin cleavage interaction in cancer progression. Researchers show that mouse models of melanoma treated with a direct-acting thrombin inhibitor have reduced tumor volume and fewer tumor nodules. That result also applied to a mouse model of ovarian cancer, suggesting broader impact of the thrombin/osteopontin target.\n\nApplications: Combination cancer therapy, Melanoma treatment.\n\nAdvantages: Novel use of existing therapeutics, Faster clinical development timeline, Improved outcomes in melanoma."

Islets transplanted with glutamine-loaded, polydopamine-coated MSNPs enjoy a longer lifespan in vitro and in vivo, enabling insulin production in animal models of Type 1 diabetes.  Not only can the cargo within MSNPs be substituted for other nutrients (i.e. other amino acids, carbohydrates, etc), the platform can also be used for to support other cellular therapies both in vitro and in vivo.\nResults\nIn vitro\nThe inventors optimized the concentration and incubation periods for glutamine and polydopamine with MSPNs that best support supported islet survival. These islets showed significantly greater survival and increased insulin secretion relative to control cells.\nIn vivo\nIn a mouse model of Type 1 diabetes, pancreatic islets transplanted with polydopamine-coated, glutamine-loaded MSNPs induced a return to normal glucose control, while control islets alone produced only a transient period of normoglycemia.

Stanford University,Method for Imaging Cell Death in vivo,Docket #: S05-346,"Published Application: 20030003047, Published Application: 20040170603, Published Application: WO2002082044",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/method-imaging-cell-death-vivo,"Programmed cell death (apoptosis) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of many diseases, such as AIDS and other viral illnesses, cerebral and myocardial ischemia, autoimmune and neurodegenerative states, organ and bone marrow transplant rejection, and tumor response to chemotherapy and radiation. Improved in vitro and histologic methods for the detection of apoptosis are rapidly expanding the understanding of the role of this process in the pathophysiology and are profoundly impacting drug development for a number of clinical disorders. An imaging technique capable of localizing and quantifying apoptosis in vivo would permit improved assessment of disease progression or regression, and similarly speed the development of therapy designed to inhibit or induce cell death.\nOne of the earliest events in apoptosis is externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS), a membrane phospholipid normally restricted to the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer. Annexin V is an endogenous, low molecular weight, highly soluble human protein with a high affinity for membrane bound PS. The invention describes several radiolabeled forms of annexin V, which permit in-vivo assessment of the sites and degree of programmed cell death. As has been shown for annexin V reagents in vitro, annexin V radionuclide imaging permits a direct assessment of programmed cell death induced by transplant rejection, acute myocardial and cerebral infarction, tumor cell death induced by chemo or radiation therapy, and the macrophage cell death in experimental atherosclerosis. The in-vivo imaging method can be used serially in the same patient, to assess response to therapy over time.\nThis patented technology can be readily applied in the clinical setting to provide noninvasive assessment of disease progression or regression. This information can be used to determine the efficacy of therapies designed to inhibit or induce apoptosis.\nStage of Development\nRadiolabeled annexin V imaging has been performed safely in human subjects, with no reported adverse events reported in studies of over 300 subjects.\n\nApplications: Non-invasive monitoring of organ or bone marrow transplant rejection, Monitoring of cell death occurring with cerebral or myocardial ischemia, Detection and monitoring of sites of infectious or noninfectious (autoimmune) inflammation prior to and during treatment, Early assessment (24 hours) of tumor response to drug, radiation, or gene therapy, In vivo imaging of cardiac allograft rejection, Alzheimer's diagnosis.\n\nAdvantages: Safe and easily applied in clinical setting, Useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of a variety of human disorders without the need for biopsy or when biopsy confirmation is not possible, Portable, able to be used at bedside, Uses existing clinical radionuclide imaging equipment."

This demonstrated that combining the BAF inhibitor compounds ATR kinase inhibitors leads to hyper synthetic lethal effects. These effects were seen even in non-BAF mutated cancer cells, particularly in highly mutated cell lines, despite the relatively non-toxic effects of Baficillin1 independently.\nTarget - These molecules selectively inhibit human SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin remodeling complexes with ARID1A.\nBackground - SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin remodeling complexes regulate transcription, replication and DNA repair through a variety of mechanisms. Subunits of the BAF complex are mutated in about 20% of human cancers. Inhibitors of ATR kinase (Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated and Rad3-related protein kinase) have recently been shown to induce a synthetic lethal function in cancer cell lines deficient in the ARID1A subunit of the BAF complex. These new macrolactam molecules were identified in a screen for mammalian SWI/SNF inhibitors that function synergistically with ATR/ATM kinase inhibitors.\nBAF/ATR pathway and results in cancer cell lines. Pathway breakdown illustrating the effects of BAF and ATR inhibition that lead to cell death. Graphs show survival of the cancer cell lines Cal-51 and MCF-7 (Breast Cancer Cell lines) treated with ATR inhibitor VE821 alone or in combination with Baficillin1 over 5 days.\nMode of action - Results suggest that selectively inhibiting BAF complexes in the presence of ATR inhibitors forces cells into mitotic catastrophe and subsequent cellular arrest. Therefore, this may serve as a viable therapeutic strategy in certain cancers. In particular, the new BAF inhibitors could sensitize aggressive, high-mutated, or potentially drug resistant cancers to a host of chemotherapeutics.

The knowledge of critical internal variables, such as SOC and SOH, are required by the Battery Management System (BMS) to ensure longevity, safety, and reliable operation of lithium-ion batteries. However, these variables cannot be measured directly via sensors.\nThis invention is an electrochemical model-based adaptive interconnected observer for combined estimation of lithium concentration in both electrodes, cell capacity, and aging-sensitive model parameters in real-time.

This technology won a KidneyX prize and may improve the health of end stage renal disease patients. This disease affects over 700,000 patients in the U.S. and most must undergo frequent hemodialysis. This requires frequent access to the patient's circulatory system with a needle, and is often achieved by a surgeon creating an arteriovenous (AV) fistula on the patient's arm. Unfortunately, surgically created AV fistulas may fail as often as 50% of the time. One of the biggest challenges is effective monitoring to know where they are failing.

Stanford University,ReMatch: data-driven software for planning distributed energy resources infrastructure,Docket #: S17-502,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/rematch-data-driven-software-planning-distributed-energy-resources-infrastructure,"A team of Stanford researchers has developed ReMatch, an efficient, data-driven DER (distributed energy resources) planning and decision support framework that accounts for a range of complexities to optimize energy resource planning. Unlike previous frameworks, which rely solely on engineering simulations, ReMatch combines engineering, data science and real-world consumer behavior to systematically analyze DER construction and deployment. This approach enables ReMatch to capture socio-technical complexities related to infrastructure and human dynamics – uncertainty in supply and demand, synergistic effects of demand-side management programs, diversity in consumer behavior and deployment dynamics of infrastructure. The algorithm accounts for individual consumers, generation infrastructure and storage infrastructure to calculate the lowest cost system to meet all consumer demand (including capital and operational costs). Furthermore, ReMatch uses smart grid data to match groups of consumers with different kinds of distributed resources based on customer's actual energy use and the ability to construct resources in that area. In summary, ReMatch can be used to enable utilities to determine what kinds of energy resources and targeted incentive programs will have the most economic and environmental impact.\nStanford Engineering News, 9/6/17 \nCould 'power from the people' cut electric bills in half?\nStage of Development\nThe inventors demonstrated the ReMatch algorithm in a case study using real hourly data from smart meters of 10,000 energy customers in California. By accounting for a wide range of consumer profiles and infrastructure solutions, their analysis showed that constructing DER infrastructure could reduce levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) nearly 50% over the lifetime of the infrastructure.\n\nApplications: Planning smart grids/distributed energy resource (DER) networks, including:, designing infrastructure, such as sizing of solar panels and battery capacity, developing incentive programs, devising efficient operation strategies.\n\nAdvantages: Reduced cost of electricity by designing systems with substantially reduced operational costs:, planned DER infrastructure could reduce LCOE nearly 50% compared to status quo, conventional systems, synergy with demand-side management could yield additional savings, Optimizes matches for consumers and infrastructure:, can be utilized to develop targeted incentive programs/policies and designing energy markets, ReMatch models infrastructure that can be progressively deployed and constructed (previous approaches only analyze infrastructures that are built simultaneously), cross-disciplinary approach accounts for socio-technical complexities (e.g., intermittent supply, heterogeneous demand and operating costs), Data-driven model - relies on real world energy consumption data rather than simulations to more accurately estimate demand, Computationally efficient analysis, Advantages of DER - dynamic control of system for environmental, economic and resiliency benefits."

Stanford University,Agents to induce immunogenicity and improve efficacy of anti-cancer therapeutics,Docket #: S15-434,"Published Application: WO2018031419, Published Application: 20190218260, Issued: 10,934,331 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/agents-induce-immunogenicity-and-improve-efficacy-anti-cancer-therapeutics,"Researchers at Stanford have developed agents to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of a variety of anti-cancer therapeutics.  Cell loss by apoptosis occurs in normal development and in tumor environments.  Apoptotic cells are distinguished from nearly living cells by the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) on the cellular membrane.  This serves as a signal to limit the immune response to protect nearby cells and tissues.  While critical to normal development, it presents an obstacle to establishing an immune response to tumors.  To overcome this protective response and provide better immunogenicity, the inventors generated agents that alter the clearance mechanisms of apoptotic tumor cells to promote an immune response. The agents are phosphatidylserine-binding bridge proteins that tether apoptotic cells to immunogenic receptors, thereby blocking normal elimination of cells while simultaneously enhancing the immune response.  The agents provided by this technology help generate an immune response and improve the effectiveness of anti-cancer therapeutics.\nStage of research\nThe inventors have shown that these agents potentiate the immune response against tumor cells and enhance therapeutic efficacy.\n\nApplications: Adjunct to increase efficacy of anti-cancer therapeutics including:, Cellular therapeutics- chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) or engineered T cell receptors (TCRs), Immune checkpoint therapeutics, Antibody-based therapeutics, Radiation therapy, Cytotoxic chemotherapy.\n\nAdvantages: New immunotherapy approach, Increases efficacy of anti-cancer therapeutics, Increases efficacy of cellular therapies in solid tumors, which had previously had only limited success., Novel phosphatidylserine-binding bridge agents."
Stanford University,Exosome platform for tissue-specific drug delivery of mRNA or other therapeutic cargo,Docket #: S17-343,"Published Application: WO2019067464, Published Application: 20210161817, Issued: 11,517,530 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/exosome-platform-tissue-specific-drug-delivery-mrna-or-other-therapeutic-cargo,"Researchers in Prof. A.C. Matin's laboratory have developed a versatile exosome (extracellular vesicle, """"EV"""") drug delivery platform that can selectively target therapeutic agents to tumors or other tissues that overexpress extracellular receptors. This technology, called “EXO-DEPT” (exosome-directed enzyme prodrug therapy), directs therapeutic agents to the disease tissue while minimizing effects on healthy tissue by utilizing high-affinity ligands tethered to exosomes. This specificity allows higher concentrations of toxic drugs to be confined to a target/tumor site while preventing damage and severe side effects elsewhere. This may also decrease the risk drug resistance. EXO-DEPT was demonstrated by delivering functional exogenous mRNA to in HER2 positive breast cancer cells, thereby converting a harmless prodrug to a highly toxic drug that arrested tumor growth in mice. The basic system could also be adapted for a range of cargo molecules (e.g., siRNA, DNA, proteins or small molecule drugs) and receptor targets (e.g., PSMA, bombasin, folate, transferrin and sigma). Moreover, as exosomes can cross the blood brain barrier, this technology can treat metastasized cancer to the brain (often the case with breast and other cancers) as well as neurological diseases, such as Alzheinmer's.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have demonstrated that the EXO-DEPT system with a high affinity anti-HER2 antibody can specifically deliver mRNA cargo to HER2 positive cells. Furthermore, they have shown that the functional mRNA delivered to the tumor cells converts a prodrug (CHOB) into a highly toxic drug (MCHB) which completely arrests tumor growth in a mouse model of HER2 positive breast cancer. This is the first demonstration of EV-mediated delivery of functional exogenous mRNA to tumors. The inventors continue to enhance the therapy and have a program to utilize the platform in treating metastatic brain tumors.\nFigures:\n\nDescription: Treatment of implanted orthotopic HER2 positive breast cancer in mice. Note that while controls show continued tumor growth, mice treated with EXO-DEPTs + the prodrug show complete arrest of tumor development.\n\nApplications: Drug/biomolecule delivery - exosome delivery of therapeutic cargo to tissue that expresses a specific extracellular receptor, particularly for tumor-targeting in cancer.\n\nAdvantages: Tissue-specific, localized delivery - by selectively targeting the drug and any toxic effects to specific cells, tumors or disease tissue, this drug delivery system could:, reduce severe side effects and prevent damage to healthy tissue, particularly for chemotherapy, increase concentration of drugs inside the targeted cells, avoid drug resistance, Versatile platform - basic EXO-DEPT platform could be adapted for:, any condition where a disease tissue or tumor overexpresses an extracellular receptor, a range of therapeutic cargos, including mRNA, siRNA, DNA, proteins or small molecule drugs or prodrugs, activating a variety of prodrugs, including the prodrug CB1954 which has already been approved for clinical trials, Exogenous mRNA delivery - “zipcode” technology promotes mRNA entry into exosomes, EXO-DEPT is the first example of functional exogenous mRNA delivered to cytoplasm via exosome, unlike DNA, mRNA can be directly translated without being transported to the nucleus and it does not have a risk of insertional mutagenesis, Crosses blood-brain barrier - enabling drug delivery to metastatic brain tumors, Advantages of exosomes/extracellular vesicles:, unlike other nanoparticles, exosomes are non-immunogenic because the lipid bilayer composition is similar to the body's own cells, especially when derived from mesenchymal stem cells or a patient's own dendritic cells, stable in vivo - can circulate for extended periods of time within the body while avoiding the endosomal pathway as well as degradation by macrophages and lysosomes, delivers cargo directly to cytoplasm."

They were programmed without modification of the nuclease protein using guide RNAs with specific patterns of mismatches to an intended DNA target. While nickases have been used for many biochemical and cell biological tasks, these often involve a modification of the protein enzyme carrying out the recognition and cleavage, which adds to the experimental and operational requirements of using CRISPR systems. An advantage of the present invention is the ability to use a native (non-altered) CRISPR protein and/or to simultaneously carry out nicking and cutting activities using the same enzyme.\nFigure:\nFigure description: Schematic of in vitro high throughput plasmid libraries and subsequent steps used to assess representation or each sequence before and after CRISPR-Cas interaction.\nStage of Development\nThe researchers have observed efficient nicking activities on specific classes of mismatched DNA targets.

Stanford University,Improved Virtual-to-Real Alignment for Augmented Reality,Docket #: S19-059,"Issued: 11,024,096 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/improved-virtual-real-alignment-augmented-reality,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a software application solution to the spatial computing problem of aligning virtual content to the real world. Medical augmented reality (AR) applications require accurate alignment, for example to visualize a brain MRI rendering on a patient's head, or a bone on his/her real leg. Currently, most alignment methods rely on tracking the real-world object, transformation of the real-world pose into the virtual object space and then rendering of the virtual object at the transformed location. But this process is subject to variations among AR operators and often leads to imperfect alignments, making the overlay inadequate for medical AR and other applications that require precision. The new method is based on the placement of virtual 'fiducials' around a real-world object. Placing the fiducials exactly at the positions where the user perceives certain real-world locations can correct any misalignments with the content on the AR display.\nStage of Development\nThe new tool has been deployed at the Stanford School of Medicine for AR neuro-navigation in Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (a type of non-invasive brain stimulation used to treat depression, for example). The method has shown accuracies of within 5mm for locating areas of interest in the brain using an AR display.\n\nApplications: Medical AR, Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), Motor threshold estimation, Stroke/aphasia rehabilitation, Registration of a body avatar or volumetric medical imaging data to a real-world body for surgical planning and navigation, Non-medical applications such as registration of equipment during assembly/maintenance tasks.\n\nAdvantages: Highly accurate, Elegant solution."

Responses were also sustained, with greater persistence than axicabtagene ciloleucel. In addition to CD19, in vivo activity was also extrapolated to CARs targeting HER2 and B7-H3.\nBackground\nExisting CAR-T cell therapies have greatly improved outcomes for difficult to treat blood cancers. However, the treatments have shortcomings in their susceptibility to disease relapse and resistance, which can be driven by low expression of the CAR's targeted tumor antigen. Researchers at Stanford have modified the extracellular 'hinge' region of the CAR construct to enable activity against even low-expression targets. Optimizing various domains of the CAR-T construct- hinge and transmembrane regions, as well as co-stimulatory domains– produced responses in a mouse model that had greater anti-tumor activity and longer persistence than existing clinical options.\nMode of action\nOptimized structural elements on a CD19-targeting CAR-T- a CD28-derived hinge region and a 4-1BB-derived co-stimulatory domain- offer stronger activity against low-frequency target antigens, paired with increased persistence versus existing CAR-T products.

The use of ultrasound to non-invasively modulate brain behavior is a growing area of research, with great potential for treating an array of neurological disorders including epilepsy, essential tremor, depression and sleep disorders. However, the precise waveform features required to enhance or suppress neurological activity have not yet been well-established. Furthermore, how different cell-types respond to these features is almost entirely unknown. These shortcomings remain a major barrier to ultrasound neuromodulation replacing or supplementing pharmacological psychiatric treatments. The new device, which uses an implantable optical fiber with an integrated ultrasonic transducer, could improve waveform selection and therefore transform the use of ultrasonic neuromodulation for psychiatric disorders.\nStage of research\nThe ability of the device to produce an ultrasonic excitation at the fiber tip has been demonstrated.

Stanford University,Method to Diagnose Narcolepsy,Docket #: S18-510,"Published Application: WO2020132063, Published Application: 20230160890",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/method-diagnose-narcolepsy,"Researchers at Stanford have developed methods to improve the diagnosis of narcolepsy.  Narcolepsy is a disorder in which people experience excessive sleepiness and uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep.  Narcolepsy is caused by the loss of specialized neurons that supply hypocretin (HCRT), a critical sleep-wake control hormone. There is no cure for the disease and diagnosis can be complicated as it requires specialized tests that can only be performed in sleep labs or clinics.  It would be beneficial to have better methods for diagnosing narcolepsy.\nTo help meet this need the inventors took advantage of their recent work showing an autoimmune contribution to the development of narcolepsy.  They have identified a specific HCRT peptide autoantigen and linked it to narcolepsy-related CD4+ effector responses mediated by the HLA-DQ6 allele and the T cell receptor alpha (TRA) J24 genetic risk allele.  In the blood of narcolepsy patients, there are detectable levels of clonally expanded risk-carrying CD4+ T cells that recognize the specific HCRT peptide through antigen presentation restricted to the HLA-DQ allele.  Detection of these autoreactive T cells specific for this HCRT peptide autoantigen can be used as a critical complement to the current methods that require sleep studies and a cerebrospinal fluid test for HCRT levels.  This technology provides a new method that may be developed to diagnose narcolepsy without sleep studies.\nStage of research\nThe inventors have identified HCRT-derived peptides that bind HLA-DQ6 and have identified TRAJ24 risk allele-bearing CD4+ T cell clonotypes that bind these peptides.\n\nApplications: Narcolepsy diagnosis, Potential for therapeutic development.\n\nAdvantages: New, non-sleep related, diagnostic for narcolepsy, Provides the first evidence demonstrating DQ6-restricted T cell autoreactivity to any self-protein that is associated with HCRT-producing neurons or that has clear narcolepsy relevance."

Stanford University,Conductive Graphene/Carbon Nanofiber Composite Scaffold for Neural Tissue Engineering,Docket #: S17-314,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/conductive-graphenecarbon-nanofiber-composite-scaffold-neural-tissue-engineering,"Stanford researchers have proposed the use of a conductive graphene scaffold (CGS) as a biocompatible scaffold for growth of neural tissues. The high conductivity enables the use of electrical stimulation to control the development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).  Neural regeneration using iPSCs offers the advantage of patient-specific derivation of neurons for neural recovery/regeneration. A 3D, cerebral cortex-like CGS exposed to electrical stimulation rapidly generates cortical neurons with more mature neuronal circuits.  This provides an exciting platform to further investigate iPSC-derived neurons' integration and regulatory role in neurodegenerative and neurovascular disease.\nFigure\nFigure description -  (a) Different size of CGSs as compared to quarter (b) SEM image of CGS top surface (c) SEM image of CGS cross section area (d)SEM image of CGS cross section area with higher magnification\nStage of Research \nThe inventors have highlighted combined mechanical and electrical stimulation via a CGS to promote a 3D microniche for rapid, high-purity conversion and maturation of iPSC-derived neurons for regenerative and disease modeling applications. Although animal in vivo models have been developed to investigate the regulatory role of cortical neurons in various disease states including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and addiction, such models do not necessarily represent human pathophysiology. By deriving iPSCs from patients with these disease states in our 3-D CGS system, tissue-like in vitro disease modeling and drug screening by directed differentiation of iPSCs with neuronal identity is possible.  Such modeling is of paramount importance in exploring adequate therapeutic agents, as well as for a thorough understanding of cortical pathophysiology.\n\nApplications: Neurodegenerative and neurovascular disease modeling - Combined cues using soft CGS provides in vitro neurodegenerative disease modeling for exploring adequate therapeutic agents as well as for understanding brain pathophysiology, Neural tissue engineering - CGS platform for culturing pluripotent stem cells in studies such as:, Investigating neural network regeneration mechanisms to identify therapeutic targets, Elucidating the role of electrical charge modulation on neural augmentation, Determining factors that are essential for neuronal regeneration and developmental stages, Delivering stem cells using brain tissue implants, Stem cell based therapy for brain diseases including stroke, neurodegenerative disease, and glioblastoma, Other potential applications include electrodes, supercapacitors, fuel cells, batteries, capacitive desalination devices, thermal and acoustic insulators, and chemical or mechanical sensors.\n\nAdvantages: 3D CGS provides an advantage over traditional 2-D, inert polymeric, and organoid systems to allow for continuous interactions with in vitro stem cells. It also provides an avenue to rapidly mature neuronal cells from iPSCs derived from a particular patient for neural regenerative strategies., Highly porous micro-niche and elastic modulus in the presence of CNF provides a soft scaffold for tissue engineering, High electrical conductivity uses electrical stimulation for controlling the differentiation and paracrine release of stem cells, Combined stimulation determines factors that are essential for disease recovery, Overcomes the drawback of inert scaffold in neural tissue engineering, Optimizes stem cell-based stroke therapeutics, Can modulate stem cells after transplantation, Introduces a new method of stem cell delivery."

The resulting devices could be comfortably worn as a patch or a band. This single modular platform provides freedom of design for wearable electronics (including medical devices) or Internet of Things applications and could even be adapted for non-technical users in craft/hobby or educational kits.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have synthesized a robust, stretchable, flexible elastomer material and demonstrated extremely high fracture energy (~12,000 J/m2) with autonomous self-healing and notch-insensitive stretching up to 1200% due to efficient self-recoverable energy dissipation.

Stanford University,CART- a transfection delivery system for efficient intracellular mRNA delivery,Docket #: S16-157,"Published Application: WO2018022930, Published Application: 20180028688, Published Application: 20240277870",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/cart-transfection-delivery-system-efficient-intracellular-mrna-delivery,"Stanford researchers have developed a new class of materials that enable new strategies for the efficient delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) into cells and animals. The delivery materials are easily prepared (2 steps), stable and readily tuned. Upon simple mixing, they form non-covalent complexes with mRNA that protect, deliver and release mRNAs of varied lengths.  While mRNA therapeutics have the potential to transform disease treatment, their large size, polyanionic nature and susceptibility to degradation by nucleases make delivering mRNA across tissues and into cells a formidable challenge.  Clinical utility is hampered by the lack of safe and effective delivery methods.  Thus new delivery systems are needed to allow the intracellular delivery of mRNA in vitro and in vivo.  To address this need the inventors developed a new, tunable, effective class of synthetic biodegradable materials called charge-altering releasable transporters (CARTs).  CARTs operate through an unprecedented mechanism, serving initially to non-covalently complex, protect and deliver the mRNA and then change their physical properties through a degradative charge-neutralizing intramolecular rearrangement to release the mRNA in cells.  This technology provides a tool for effective mRNA delivery that results in functional protein expression both in cells and animals. It can also be extended to other RNAs and has shown efficacy with plasmid DNA with up to 10,000 negative charges.\nStage of research\nCART transfection efficiency was tested in vitro using multiple cell lines, including hard to transfect J774 cells.

Groups at UC Davis, UC Irvine, Stanford University, University of Michigan and Cornell conduct studies on human post-mortem tissue, isolated populations and various animal models to identify altered profiles of gene expression in brain circuits associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.\nClinical depression, including both bipolar disorders and major depression disorders, is a major public health problem, affecting an estimated 9.5% of the adult population of the United States each year. While it has been hypothesized that mental illness, including mood disorders such as major depression (""""MDD"""") and bipolar disorder (""""BP"""") as well as psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, may have genetic roots, little progress has been made in identifying gene sequences and gene products that play a role in causing these disorders, as is true for many diseases with a complex genetic origin.\nThe current lack of biomarkers and the ineffectiveness and reliability of the diagnosis and rates are important issues for the treatment of mental disorders. For example, around 15% of the population suffers from MDD while approximately 1% suffers from BP disorders. Diagnosing bipolar disorder is difficult when, as sometimes occurs, the patient presents only symptoms of depression to the clinician. At least 10-15% of BP patients are reported to be misdiagnosed as MDD. The consequences of such misdiagnosis include a delay in being introduced to efficacious treatment with mood stabilizers and a delay in seeking or obtaining counseling specific to bipolar disorder. Also, treatment with antidepressants alone induces rapid cycling, switching to manic or mixed state, and consequently increases suicide risk.\nThe inventors of the present application have used DNA microarrays to study expression profiles of human post-mortem brains from patients diagnosed with BP or MDD. One aspect of the technology demonstrates differential expression of the FGF pathway in the frontal cortex of MDD subjects. Particular, through a separate analysis of specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-treated and non-SSRI-treated MDD subjects that the observed changes in expression of FGF transcripts are not secondary to drug treatment. Rather, changes in specific FGF transcripts are attenuated by SSRIs and may thus be partially responsible for the mechanism of action of these drugs.The FGF-related genes could be used as a component of a diagnostic for BP or MDD.\n\nApplications: Diagnose and guide treatment of major depression and bipolar disorder., Identify compounds which are effective in treating major depression and/or bipolar disorder..\n\nAdvantages: Use of gene expression in different brain regions to diagnose, and direct treatment of mental illness., Can be detected with PCR, microarrays, or in situ hybridization., Can track disease progression.."

Mucin glycans are consumed by bacterial residents of the intestine via the same pathways the bacteria use to consume the oligosaccharides found in human breast milk. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are also structurally similar to mucin glycans. Both families of molecules may be able to facilitate assembly of the microbiota of the human gut shortly after birth. Mammalian mucin glycans can be readily released and purified from mucin proteins, which might be sourced from cows or pigs. These mucin glycans could then be added to commercial infant formula to mimic the function of human milk oligosaccharides.\nThe innovators have demonstrated that the polysaccharide utilization loci up-regulated during growth in HMO are the same loci mobilized when Bacteroides, a dominant genus within the intestinal microbiota of westerners, use structurally similar host mucus glycans.\n\nApplications: Infant formula - can be added to infant formula to mimic the function of human milk oligosaccharides.\n\nAdvantages: Improved formulation - addition of mucin glycans would make infant formula more closely resemble human breast milk, Prophylactic - may help prevent invasion of pathogens in the intestines by aiding in the assembly of the natural microbiota of the gut."
Stanford University,Non-invasive blood test for diagnosing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis,Docket #: S18-217,"Published Application: WO2020142276, Published Application: 20210396753",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/non-invasive-blood-test-diagnosing-crohns-disease-and-ulcerative-colitis,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a non-invasive method, based on the identification of novel immune signatures in the blood, for diagnosing Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This diagnosis has conventionally relied on invasive, expensive and risky endoscopic procedures. Misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis due to time required for endoscopy and histopathology analysis of biopsies remain serious problems that delay optimal treatment representing a critical unmet need. Earlier treatment leads to better outcomes, and treatment for patients with active disease is frequently delayed by the time required for differentiation of CD versus UC by these invasive and costly procedures. In contrast, the new method may be implemented easily on existing equipment using a single fresh or frozen blood specimen, potentially enabling earlier and more definitive diagnosis, as well as with minor adaptations better monitoring and precision treatment of IBD patients.\nFigure:\nFigure description: Circulating leukocytes distinguish Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). A) Schematic of the study conducted. Blood was drawn from study subjects and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated. B) Samples were analyzed by mass cytometry (CyTOF) or flow cytometry for independent validation. C) The discriminatory performance of blood markers was compared to standard-of-care colonoscopy, and diagnostic models were optimized. Adapted from Rubin et al., Nature Communications, 2019.\nStage of Development\nThe researchers have identified several blood-based signatures that differentiate CD from UC, and most importantly perform similarly to the standard-of-care endoscopy/colonoscopy for patients who have active disease – the most significant clinical unmet need. They have developed the diagnostic markers on a training patient cohort using mass cytometry (CyTOF) and validated the discriminatory performance on an independent validation patient cohort dataset using conventional clinical flow cytometry. They continue to study the markers on additional patients and optimize the diagnostic model to differentiate other clinically-relevant subtypes of IBD and predict therapeutic response to improve precision medicine in IBD and save patients and the healthcare system time, cost and adverse effects.\n\nApplications: Blood-based diagnosis and sub-typing of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.\n\nAdvantages: Method is less invasive, safer and cheaper than standard-of-care endoscopy/colonoscopy., Potentially more sensitive and specific than standard-of care endoscopy/colonoscopy, serology, and stool markers., Can be performed on flow cytometers commonly found in clinical diagnostic labs., Could be introduced clinically to reduce delay, risk, discomfort and cost to patients, and improve outcomes by arriving at a definitive diagnosis faster., Could be easily adapted as a companion diagnostic for existing or emerging therapies.."

Affinity tags are commonly used to isolate and purify proteins, lipids, polysaccharides and other molecules of interest from a background of contaminating material. The new hydroxamate tags bind selectively and reversibly to ytterbium metal ions, enabling immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using reusable, commercially available resins.\nHydroxamate tags have several advantages relative to other affinity strategies such as biotin-streptavidin binding or alkyne functionalization.  In particular, they enable reversible binding with a pH-based elution of bound material, producing pure samples for downstream analysis with high yield and specificity.  In addition, hydroxamate tags are compact (60 Da), bio-orthogonal, and highly soluble in aqueous solutions.  Because the hydroxamate-ytterbium interaction is distinct from other common binding modes, hydroxamate tags can be used in parallel with biotin tags, for example, in situations requiring multiple orthogonal affinity tags.\nRelated Technologies:\nStanford docket S19-004 – describing an ultra-sensitive, in vivo protein footprinting technique using thiol alkylating agents.\nStanford docket S19-005 – describing improved tags for separating crosslinked peptides for mass spectrometry.\nStanford docket S19-007 – describing a first-of-its-kind family of protein crosslinkers that can be cleaved and easily detected by mass spectrometry.\nStage of Development\nHydroxamate affinity tags have been paired with multiple different reactive groups to label proteins at thiols or at N-termini.  In one test, the new method resulted in an 86-fold improvement in fractional abundance of an affinity-tagged synthetic peptide in a complex mixture of tryptic peptides, with a 70% yield for the peptide of interest.  Subjecting enriched samples to a second enrichment step improved the fractional abundance of the affinity-tagged peptide >300-fold.\n\nApplications: Isolation and purification of biological macromolecules for downstream analysis (e.g., mass spectrometry), Can generally be used in place of or in addition to biotin affinity tags.\n\nAdvantages: Hydroxamate tags feature multiple advantages over biotin systems including:, Reversible ytterbium binding enables pH-based elution, Bio-orthogonal interaction, More compact (60 Da vs 244 Da), Yield purer samples for downstream analysis, Better solubility properties in water, Process uses commercially available, highly reusable resins., Eliminate expensive, single-use reagent (streptavidin resin)."

Crosslinks, both naturally occurring and artificial, play a key role in the structure and interaction of proteins and are routinely detected by digesting the protein into shorter peptides that are examined by mass spectrometry. Therefore, it is critical to the throughput and sensitivity of mass spectrometry experiments to separate crosslinked peptides (which have two N-termini) from linear peptides (single N-terminus). The researchers took advantage of this distinction to design two novel affinity tags that bind selectively to the N-termini; only crosslinked peptides will append both tags and will be extracted for purification and analysis by mass spectrometry.

Optic neuropathies are a group of optic nerve diseases characterized by the progressive death of RGCs and optic nerve degeneration. Optic neuropathy is the most common clinical cause of irreversible blindness. There is no effective neuroprotective treatment to prevent RGC/optic nerve degeneration.  Genes involved in RGC signaling have been found to play roles in RGC/optic nerve degeneration and thus serve as potential gene therapy targets.  However, before effective gene therapies can be developed a method to specifically target the RGCs is needed.  To help meet this need, the inventors identified a promoter that specifically and potently sustains transgene expression in RGCs.  They then developed a gene therapy method to treat optic neuropathy that combines this RGC-specific promoter with CRISPR gene editing targeted to the ER stress and/or UPR pathway.  This technology provides a much-needed neuroprotective treatment for optic neuropathies.\nStage of research\nThe inventors performed a proof-of-concept study using a mouse optic nerve crush in vivo axon injury model.

These transgenic plants can produce significant quantities of a large panel of soluble ligninases. A crude leaf extract can then be used to degrade lignin in vitro. The basic platform can be expanded to produce other enzymes of interest, providing a robust, reliable, versatile system to produce biocatalysts. This system could capitalize on the massive lignin waste stream to produce biofuels and industrial chemicals.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have demonstrated that multiple enzymes from major fungal lignin-modifying enzyme families can be produced at high titers using with this tobacco expression system.

Stanford University,"Bright, cyan-excitable orange fluorescent proteins and bioluminescence reporters",Docket #: S14-321,"Published Application: 20160376332, Issued: 9,908,918 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/bright-cyan-excitable-orange-fluorescent-proteins-and-bioluminescence-reporters,"Stanford researchers have engineered an exceptionally bright, cyan-excitable orange-red fluorescent protein (CyOFP) that can be used both for multiplex imaging with GFP and for high-sensitivity, bioluminescent in vivo imaging. This technology includes the isolated CyOFP and a CyOFP luciferase fusion protein that produces red photons (greater than 600nm) at 150x the rate of the firefly luciferase.\nBecause CyOFP can be induced by the same cyan light that induces GFP, it enables easy, simultaneous imaging of multiple structures or events without custom hardware. Furthermore, the CyOFP fusion protein provides bright photon output at red wavelengths that are effective for deep-tissue imaging in mammals, allowing sensitive detection of reporter proteins present in fewer than 1000 cells. This combination of features make CyOFP well-suited for advanced non-linear and light-sheet microscopy.\nBy overcoming in vivo sensitivity limits of bioluminescence, CyOFP could become the reporter of choice for tracking cell number, cell movement and gene expression in a small number of cells in live animals.\nStage of Development\nThe inventors have demonstrated that CyOFP enables single-excitation multiplexed imaging with GFP-based probes in single- and two-photon microscopy, including time-lapse imaging in light-sheet systems. They have also shown that the CyOFP fusion protein is a highly sensitive bioluminescent report in vivo, producing 18x more emission in mice than firefly luciferase.\n\nApplications: Advanced microscopy - enables red photon emissions simultaneous with GFP for multiplex imaging in cell-based or gene expression assays, In vivo imaging:, non-invasive, bioluminescent tracking of cell number, cell movement or gene expression in live mammals, particularly useful for imaging small numbers of cells (1000) in deep tissue for stem cell implantation or preclinical testing of cancer therapeutics, Bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET) systems.\n\nAdvantages: Red photon emission (600nm):, optimal for deep tissue imaging, useful as companion reporter with well-established GFP reporters for detecting two structures or biological events, Bright:, CyOFP fusion protein produces red photons that transmit through mammalian tissue at 150x the rate of previous luciferases or BRET systems, bright emission enables highly sensitive detection (1000 cells), Cyan-excitable:, enables co-excitation of CyOFP and GFP using the same hardware in state-of-the art microscopy applications such as super-resolution imaging or advanced light-sheet and two-photon techniques, faster results without any need to adjust for time shift from acquition of different image channels."

The atomic layer deposited interfacial layer reduces side reactions between electrolyte and electrode when operated at a wide electrochemical window, maintains power density, and improves energy density – making a safer battery.   These thin films are electrochemically inert, chemically stable, lithium ion conductive and can be applied to various battery cathodes.\nStage of Research\nResearchers successfully deposited and tested the interfacial layer on high Ni content, layered lithium transition metal oxides.  NMC-811 (LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2), a low cost and high capacity electrode, is often limited to narrower electrochemical windows to maintain long-term stability.  The  LiAlF4 film provided a stable and lithium permeable interfacial layer - stable over 300 cycles with capacity retention higher than 99.9% per cycle at a wide electrochemical window of 2.75-4.50V vs. Li+/Li with a capacity exceeding 140 mAh/g.  The LiAlF4 film coated electrode also outperformed uncoated samples at elevated temperatures (50 C) – pristine samples rapidly decayed from 200 mAh/g to less than 100 mAh/g within 100 cycles, while  LiAlF4 coated samples maintained capacity exceeding 140 mAh/g within 100 cycles.\nFor further demonstration of ALD films, Stanford researchers deposited chemically inert and ionically conductive LiAlO2 on LiCoO2 electrodes by atomic layer deposition.  The LiAlO2 coating prevented reactions between the electrode and electrolyte, while allowing lithium ions to freely diffuse into LiCoO2 without sacrificing power density during prolonged high-voltage cycling. The coated electrode's capacity value neared 200 mAh/g for 50 stable cycles with commercial level loading densities (cycled at cut-off potential of 4.6 V vs. Li+/Li) - a 40% capacity gain compared with commercial samples cycled at a cut-off potential of 4.2 V vs. Li+/Li.\nFigure 1.

Nfe212 encodes NRF2, a member of the """"cap 'n' collar"""" (CNC) subfamily of the basic region-leucine zipper transcription factors. NRF2 is a regulator of endogenous antioxidant protection, microglial function, and chronic neuroinflammation. Homozygotes are viable and fertile. In the absence of Cre, reporter gene expression is prevented by the floxed sequence (STOP). After removal of the loxP-flanked STOP cassette via cre-mediated recombination, the luciferase fusion construct behaves similar to wildtype protein where it is bound by Keap1, uibiquitiniated, and degraded by the proteosome; however during oxidative stress or induction by NRF2 activators, the luciferase fusion construct is released from KEAP1 and luciferase luminescence can be observed. As a result, this luciferase fusion construct functions as a reporter of NRF2 activity as well as a knockout for NRF2. Previous NRF2 mice containing inactivation of the CNC, DNA binding, and leucine zipper domains results in age-related macular degeneration (AMD)-like retinal pathology, spontaneous choroidal neovascularization (CNV), increased sensitivity to toxins, impaired adipogenesis, abnormal mitochondria, and an increase in proinflammatory gene expression in microglia and astrocytes.

CAR-engineered T cells have shown great promise as cancer therapeutics.  In CAR T cell therapy a patient's T cells are collected and engineered to produce CARs on their surface.  These CARs then target and bind to a specific antigen on the patient's tumor cells to kill them.  CARs, unlike naturally occurring T cell receptors, can directly recognize their target antigens without restriction.  Thus, T cells engineered to express CARs have potential to generate high-levels of antitumor activity.  Despite this potential only a few CARs targeting solid tumors have been developed, as many target antigens that are also present on normal cells which can lead to undesired off-target killing.  Thus, new approaches that minimize off-target effects are needed. To help meet this need the inventors have developed CARs that selectively target GPC2.  GPC2 has very restricted expression in normal tissue but is expressed on many hard-to-treat pediatric and adult solid tumors.  This technology provides new CARs that may be used as therapeutics for difficult to treat solid tumor cancers.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have engineered and optimized CARs targeting GPC2.

Stanford University,Improved lipid nanodiscs for studies of membrane proteins,Docket #: S19-053,Published Application: WO2020257637,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/improved-lipid-nanodiscs-studies-membrane-proteins,"Researchers at Stanford and their colleagues have developed compositions and methods for producing improved lipid nanodiscs that enable more effective studies of membrane proteins.  Traditionally, scientists have studied proteins using x-ray crystallography.  This is a tedious and challenging task, particularly for membrane proteins.  Recently, cryo-EM methods have been developed to study integral membrane proteins.  These methods do not require protein crystallization, but they do require the proteins to be removed from membranes, which can lead to denaturation.  To reduce this challenge, lipid nanodiscs have been developed to hold the proteins together.  These nanodiscs, however, have their own complications as they lack structural regularity, can lose co-factors, may require harmful detergent steps for formation, and  formation may be time-sensitive.  To overcome these limitations, the inventors have developed these compositions and methods to create simpler, more effective lipid nanodiscs.  This technology provides for the use of poly (styrene-co-acrylic acid) (AASTY) copolymers to effectively make regularly sized lipid nanodiscs by incubating the polymer with lipid bilayers, including living cell membranes.  This technology reduces the challenges associated with studying membrane proteins as it enables them to be studied in their native conformation.\nStage of research\nProof-of-concept studies have shown great promise.

Stanford University,GOTI- method to identify off target mutations caused by gene editors,Docket #: S19-079,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/goti-method-identify-target-mutations-caused-gene-editors,"Researchers at Stanford and their colleagues have developed a method to detect off-target mutations caused by gene editing tools. Genome editing, by CRISPR-Cas9, cytosine base editor 3 (BE3) or adenine base editor 7.10 (ABE7.10), holds great promise for treating diseases caused by pathogenic mutations. However, these methods can have off-target, undesired effects. Thus, a comprehensive analysis of off-target effects is needed. Methods have been developed to detect genome-wide gene editing of off-target sites, but these approaches are limited as they cannot detect single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in vivo. To help overcome this limitation, the inventors have developed the GOTI (genome-wide off-target analysis by two-cell embryo injection) method. GOTI can be used to evaluate the off-target effects and identify SNVs caused by a variety of gene editors. Further, use of the GOTI method enabled the inventors to develop and provide an improved version of the BE3 editor which performs clean on-target edits without off-target effects. This technology can be used to evaluate and reduce the off-target effects of gene editing tools thereby increasing their potential for use in correcting pathogenic mutations.\nStage of research\nUsing GOTI, the inventors found that BE3 caused SNVs at off-target sites with frequencies more than 20-fold higher than the spontaneous mutation rate.\n\nApplications: Gene editing research tool- method to detect off-target mutations.\n\nAdvantages: Can be used to examine the off-target effects of a variety of gene editing tools, Potential to improve the fidelity of base editing enzymes, GOTI examines cell populations derived from one gene edited blastomere, Maintains signal to allow random off-target effects to be detected."

Stanford University,Combination of differentiation therapy and metabolic intervention to treat neuroblastoma,Docket #: S18-498,"Published Application: 20200261393, Issued: 11,684,601 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/combination-differentiation-therapy-and-metabolic-intervention-treat-neuroblastoma,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a combination therapy to treat neuroblastoma, the most common and deadly solid tumor in childhood. Neuroblastoma derives from neural crest cells that fail to exit the cell cycle and differentiate. Retinoic acid (RA) has been used to treat this cancer as it leads to cell cycle arrest and induces differentiation. However, neuroblastoma is often resistant to this therapy. Hypoxia, a common metabolic stress existing in the tumor microenvironment, promotes dedifferentiation of neuroblastoma cells and increases resistance to RA. Thus, new methods of treating neuroblastoma are needed.\nTo help meet this need the inventors have identified mechanisms underlying hypoxia-mediated therapy resistance and developed a new approach to improve the response to RA-based differentiation therapy. Here, the inventors provide a combination therapy using both RA and acetate supplementation. This combination provides metabolic interventions which induce differentiation of cancer cells.\nThis technology provides an effective therapeutic approach to increase the sensitivity of the hypoxic tumor to differentiation therapy and thus treat neuroblastoma. Further, in addition to neuroblastoma, RA and other retinoids have shown promising anti-cancer effects in cell lines or preclinical models of other types of solid tumors, it is expected that this combination therapeutic strategy might have a broad application that is not limited to neuroblastoma treatment.\nStage of research\nInitial validation studies show great promise. Additional development is ongoing.\nHypoxia is a common tumor microenvironmental stress that represses the differentiation induced by retinoic acid (RA) by reducing global histone acetylation and chromatin accessibility. Upon hypoxia, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) are induced to phosphorylate pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), thereby blocking pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle, reducing acetyl-CoA and citrate generation, and promoting the Warburg effect. Acetate supplementation restores chromatin accessibility along with differentiation markers expression and neuron differentiation.  These findings suggest that combining differentiation therapy in the form of RA with acetate supplementation might represent an effective therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.\n\nApplications: Treatment for neuroblastom.\n\nAdvantages: Improve the response of the hypoxic tumor to differentiation therapy, More effective therapeutic strategy to treat neuroblastoma, Can be used in combination with conventional treatments."

Many of these applications require large numbers of features to be transmitted or stored, which warrants low bit rate descriptors for increased scalability and efficiency. However, current feature descriptors perform well at image recognition tasks, but are very inefficient in terms of bit-rate. For example, SIFT descriptors are conventionally stored as 1024 bits and SURF feature descriptors are stored as 2048 bits.

Image content description is used in a wide range of applications, including web-scale image search and real-time object recognition, but the effectiveness is constrained by a computational bottleneck. Augmented reality applications are further constrained because the mobile device's resources must be shared between camera pose tracking and image content recognition. Technologies capable of real-time tracking typically do not perform well at recognition from large-scale databases. Conversely, algorithms which excel at recognition are typically not fast enough for real-time tracking on mobile devices.\nInvention. Stanford and Nokia researchers have developed an end-to-end feature extraction algorithm which is state-of-the-art in both speed and accuracy. Simultaneously computing image and filter scale spaces which enables real-time feature extraction with scale invariance. The Rotation Invariant Fast Feature (RIFF) allows for very low complexity description of local image patches. This allows for unified tracking and recognition as the complexity is low enough for real-time use on a mobile device. Accuracy is high enough for content detection.\nThe high speed of the algorithm is attributable to several factors:\n•	Box filtering - the filter response of the interest point detector is extremely low-complexity;\n•	Low scale-space overhead - the scale-space representation computes very few filter responses,\n•	while capturing the full space;\n•	Filter re-use - while computing a filter response scale-space, an image scale-space is obtained at no additional cost;\n•	No pixel interpolation – all computation is on the original image raster and at no time are pixels or gradients interpolated or rotated;\n•	Radial gradients - unlike (x, y)-gradients, radial gradients allow for placing gradients into oriented spatial bins without rotation.\n\nApplications: Real-time object recognition, Web-scale image search, Hand-held product recognition,, Three dimensional reconstruction, Panorama Stitching, Robotic mapping, Video tracking, Augmented reality.\n\nAdvantages: Most accurate for the speed.."

The recognition step, in which location, scale, and orientation information of the image features is extracted from the viewfinder frame and then transmitted from the client mobile phone to powerful computing resources where visual search and recognition are performed, is particularly data intensive. Any improvements to the compression of information can significantly reduce the time and power required for the recognition step and correspondingly enhance the response of the interactive augmented reality experience.\nIn this invention, two new methods are shown to significantly improve compression of location information of query features in an image. In multi-size block encoding, a binary map is used to describe the histogram map in larger strides. Square blocks of histogram bins are grouped together and a value is assigned to represent if it is occupied. Histogram bins are then coded only for the groups that are occupied. This method gives a scalability over a wide range of feature counts.\nThe occupancy-based context model provides a finer level of detail. The histogram map is coded in a raster scan order and includes occupancy information based on its neighboring histogram bins using only the number of features that fall in the neighboring bin at a given distance. This new occupancy-based method has a much smaller context space which can both reduce the encoder size and make the data requirements for the training samples far less stringent.\n\nApplications: Applications in which features in a image is transmitted over a channel. For example, in a mobile visual search system, the query information may need to be sent over the network to a server for processing. The invention would reduce the amount of information transmitted., Applications in which a set of features is stored inside a database. For example, when one performs image matching, features are stored inside the hard drive and loaded into memory for comparison.

Stanford University,Streaming Video to Mobile Clients Using Peer-to-Peer Systems,Docket #: S11-079,"Published Application: 20120054818, Issued: 8,832,751 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/streaming-video-mobile-clients-using-peer-peer-systems,"A system for enabling streaming video to a mobile client includes a plurality of fixed node peers linked to the mobile client via one or more networks as well as a video source linked to fixed node peers and configured to provide streaming video data representing a video presentation to each of the fixed node peers. A decoder assembly associated with each of the fixed node peers is configured to decode the streaming video data and to transcode a portion of the decoded streaming video data for transmission to the mobile client. A video substream manager and interleaver on the mobile client is provided for receiving the transcoded output of the decoder assemblies of the fixed node peers and reconstructing the video presentation on a screen of the mobile client.\n\nApplications: Video streaming to mobile users when a large population of fixed-line users (e.g., personal computers or set-top boxes) watch a live program., Fault-tolerant systems, including typical media servers. Servers in a data center, or distributed over physically different regions, can form a peer-to-peer network, serving mobile clients. Mobile clients can connect to multiple servers close to them simultaneously., Video-on-demand service. In this case, a peer (or server) possessing the video contents becomes a video source..\n\nAdvantages: For mobile streaming, transcoding is necessary not only to reduce the video bitrate, but also to change the video encoding. Each mobile phone usually has its own transcoding requirements in terms of video encoding scheme, frame rates, spatial resolution, and the bitrate. This poses a large burden of video processing on the video server or CDNs. Mobile P2P streaming is a good solution because it harnesses the users' excess computing power in addition to their uplink bandwidth., Due to the hardware requirements, there is a limit on the number of concurrent multicast sessions allowed at Internet routers.  In case of IP-TV, the scalability is not an issue because the number of IP-TV channels is usually a few hundred, and is under the control of the content provider (and ISP). However, the number of user-generated contents can be huge. P2P streaming can overcome such limited scalability. P2P will be especially useful when each session has a small number of viewers, yet the number of concurrent sessions is high, compared to IP multicast., P2P streaming has a potential beyond live streaming, such as 	extit{time-shifted streaming}. Time-shifted streaming is achieved by storing the past portion of the live stream in the P2P system, usually at each peer. IP multicast only supports live streaming because  storing contents at Internet routers is very costly, even considered impossible. Time-shifted streaming for mobile clients can also be supported if the P2P network is enhanced to support time-shifted streaming.."
Stanford University,Distributed Audio Transcoding For Peer-to-Peer Systems,Docket #: S11-078,"Published Application: 20120029911, Issued: 8,392,201 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/distributed-audio-transcoding-peer-peer-systems,"Mobile devices often connect to the network via wireless channels. In general, the downlink of the wireless channel (e.g., the cellular access network) is limited in throughput. The wireless channel may also suffer from transient fading or unexpected interferences, which results in throughput fluctuation. Thus, it is desirable to adjust the bitrate of the audio stream over time to adapt to channel conditions. In addition, it is desirable if one can adapt the audio signal  to individual mobile users depending on the requirements of applications and hardware limitations of mobile devices (e.g., low-end built-in speaker). The change in the bitrate or the quality of the audio signal can be achieved by transcoding.\nThis invention describes a distributed transcoding algorithm for audio streaming to mobile users in P2P systems. The algorithm allows several fixed nodes to perform transcoding for a mobile device. After a mobile device connects to multiple fixed nodes as its parents, each parent generates a substream by transcoding the original audio. These substreams are transmitted and assembled at the mobile device as if they were a single stream. If the mobile device loses some of its parents, it can decode the incomplete signal and the user experiences graceful degradation instead of complete disruption.\n\nApplications: Distributed audio streaming systems, such as distributed media servers or peer-to-peer based systems., Reliable systems or systems consisting of reliable and unreliable components. For example, when a reliable component is present, some reliable entity may stream the base layer and eliminate its duplication transmission. Enhancement layers can then be transmitted by either reliable/unreliable entities. Since the base layer stream is independent of the number of parents, mobile receivers can connect to a multicast group to receive the base layer stream, if available..\n\nAdvantages: Distributed audio transcoding (format and/or coding conversion) algorithm that produces coded outputs that are gracefully degradable under packet loss or transcoding entity failure., Light-weight and robust transcoding algorithm suitable for peer-to-peer streaming systems.."

Stanford University,Monocyte-selective atherosclerosis drug delivery system,Docket #: S18-375,"Published Application: WO2020190590, Published Application: 20220151921",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/monocyte-selective-atherosclerosis-drug-delivery-system,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a targeted delivery system using carbon nanotubes to specifically deliver cardiovascular drugs to treat atherosclerosis.  A feature of atherosclerotic plaque is the accumulation of apoptotic cells.  These cells are meant to be cleared out via a phagocytic process known as efferocytosis to prevent the inflammatory consequences associated with the accumulation of apoptotic debris. However, efferocytosis can be turned off by expression of the anti-phagocytic """"don't eat me"""" signal from CD47.\nIt was recently found that CD47 expression is significantly increased in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.  Thus, methods that block CD47 signaling could restore efferocytosis and treat atherosclerosis.  However, anti-CD47 antibodies have detrimental side effects such as anemia. To overcome this limitation, the inventors have developed a targeted delivery system using single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) to specifically deliver an inhibitor of the CD47 signaling pathway (downstream of CD47).  This method allows the inhibitor to be specifically delivered to the monocytes that perform efferocytosis thereby reactivating them.  This technology provides a targeted delivery system to more effectively treat atherosclerosis.\nStage of research\nUsing mouse models, the inventors showed that pro-efferocytic SWNTs reduced plaque burden in vivo without inducing anemia or compromising safety. Inventors are continuing research on potential utility with other macrophage-specific pathways.\n\nApplications: Treat or prevent atherosclerosis.\n\nAdvantages: New method to treat atherosclerosis by restoring efferocytosis, Targeted, minimally-invasive, monocyte-selective immunotherapy, Targeted delivery system:, Reduces the required dosage of the drug, Minimizes drug-associated side effects, Compared to stents and surgical treatments, this approach is non-invasive and likely to be as or more efficacious."

TSA is a very sensitive method for detecting low abundance biomolecules by immunocytochemistry (ICC), immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). However, TSA is limited in that it can only be used to detect a few epitopes (3 or less) at a time. This inhibits its use in fields such as clinical diagnostics. To overcome this limitation and expand the uses of TSA, the inventors have developed these methods and reagents. This technology provides TSA reagents that enable the analysis of biomolecules by mass cytometry, multiplex ion beam imaging (MIBI), fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy.

Whereas traditional dual-energy computed tomography (CT) systems have difficulty identifying explosive liquids or powders in security inspections, this new system uses Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) to greatly increase the contrast when imaging liquids or low-density materials. DPC provides a tri-signature derived from three independent material property measurements: standard absorption (ABS); index of refraction (DPC); and dark field scattering (VIS), to produce an image that can then be processed and analyzed for automated material identification. This DPC technology enables new inspection techniques as well as the automatic discrimination between hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and low-density powders in cluttered baggage and containers. In addition, the system has the potential to provide a 16-fold increase in speed of conventional DPC X-ray systems, as well as a substantial reduction in X-ray exposure, in comparison to current X-ray and CT techniques.\nA recent development in this project is a fast, simple and effective image processing algorithm to remove X-ray DPC CT artifacts caused by sharp edges of the object being imaged.

Mucin domains are densely o-glycosylated modular protein domains that are found in a wide variety of cell surface and secreted proteins. They contribute to many biological processes and diseases (including cancer) as they mediate cell-cell and cell-environment interactions. As such, there has been great interest in mucins. Despite this interest, little is known about their molecular structures and biological activities. This is due to challenges arising from the size, heavy glycosylation and protease resistance of mucins. To overcome these challenges the inventors have identified a new tool- the bacterial protease StcE, that can be used to study the biology of mucins. StcE efficiently and selectively cleaves mucin domains by recognizing a discrete peptide and glycan-based motif. The StcE protease now enables mucins to be selectively liberated from biological samples and cut into fragments amenable to analysis.

One emerging molecular imaging tool to address this limitation involves contrast-enhanced ultrasound using microbubbles targeted to molecular signatures on tumor neovasculature. Stanford researchers have demonstrated how tumor vascular expression of B7-H3 (CD276), a member of the B7 family of ligands for T-cell coregulatory receptors, can be incorporated into an ultrasound method that can distinguish normal, benign, precursor, and malignant breast pathologies for diagnostic purposes. Through an IHC analysis of 248 human breast specimens, researchers have found that vascular expression of B7-H3 was selectively and significantly higher in breast cancer tissues compared to non-malignant breast lesions and normal breast tissue. B7-H3 immunostaining on blood vessels distinguished benign/precursors from malignant lesions with high diagnostic accuracy in human specimens (AUC up to 0.96). In a transgenic mouse model of cancer, the B7-H3–targeted ultrasound imaging signal was increased significantly in breast cancer tissues and highly correlated with ex vivo expression levels of B7-H3 on quantitative immunofluorescence.

Stanford University,Glaucoma Animal Models Based on Silicone Oil-Induced Mild/Chronic and Severe/Acute Reversible Ocular Hypertension,Docket #: S19-013,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/glaucoma-animal-models-based-silicone-oil-induced-mildchronic-and-severeacute-reversible,"Stanford researchers developed glaucoma mouse models for studying neuroprotection treatments and molecular mechanism of IOP-related neurodegeneration. The Stanford procedure requires only one injection of silicone oil in the anterior chamber to induce pupillary block and ocular hypertension with severe RGC loss, optic nerve degeneration and vision deficits that faithfully resemble clinical secondary glaucoma. Ocular hypertension is reversible by simply removing the silicone oil. Two additional variations of this model simulate two distinct glaucoma types. The first is a chronic model produced by high frequency pupillary dilation after SO-induced pupillary block, which shows sustained moderate IOP elevation and corresponding slow, mild glaucomatous neurodegeneration. The second, an acute model created by no pupillary dilation, shows a greatly elevated IOP and severe inner retina degeneration at an early time point.\nThese simple, inducible and reversible models will standardize ocular hypertension-induced pathology and support studies of pathogenetic mechanisms and of selection of neuroprotectants for glaucoma. With continued research, these models can be extended to other animal species with minimal modifications.\nStage of Research\n\nApplications: Animal model for evaluating treatment for glaucoma, Animal model for investigating IOP-related neurodegeneration, Animal model for evaluating neuroprotectants for glaucoma, other optic neuropathies with RGC degeneration and other CNS neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nAdvantages: Mimics secondary post-operative glaucoma, Recapitulates phenotypes of two major glaucoma forms, Simple, inducible and reversible, Effective in vivo method to test neuroprotective therapies by targeting neuronal endoplasmic reticulum stress, Produces glaucoma pathology quickly (80% of retinal ganglion cell death at 5-8 weeks), Sustains IOP elevation for a long period of time without permanent damage to the eye, Does not require special equipment or repeat injections."

Stanford University,A Novel Red-shifted ChannelRhodopsin - ChRmine,Docket #: S18-547,Published Application: WO2020150093,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/novel-red-shifted-channelrhodopsin-chrmine,"Researchers at Stanford have discovered a powerful new optogenetic actuator- a novel red-shifted opsin.  Optogenetics is a technique used to study function and communication between cells.  It involves the use of light-activated proteins to change the membrane voltage potential of neurons as well as other cells.  In neurons, membrane depolarization creates action potentials which are the basis of neuronal excitation. Conversely, membrane hyperpolarization leads to the inhibition of such signals.  To have even more control in optogenetic studies of the brain, more actuators are needed. To help meet this need the inventors have used microbial opsin crystal structure-based genome mining to identify a novel red-shifted opsin that they named ChRmine.  This opsin has ideal properties for use in optogenetics.  Its markedly improved light sensitivity, robustness to elicit action potentials, and red-shifted spectral properties make it an ideal tool for high level precision reading and writing of neuronal activities when combined with blue-light based activity reporters.  This technology extends optogenetic capabilities.\nStage of research\nThis tool has been used in measuring naturally-occurring large-scale 3D ensemble activity patterns during visual experience, and then replaying these patterns at the level of many individually-specified cells.\n\nApplications: Optogenetics, Single-cell optical manipulations, Read and write from multiple cells, Non-invasive, deep tissue stimulation of central and peripheral nervous system.\n\nAdvantages: Red-shifted light sensitivity, Extremely large photocurrents alongside millisecond spike-timing fidelity, Effective tool to:, Excite cells with a low light power, Achieve non-invasive control either transcranially or transdermally, Combine with GECIs for real time calcium imaging and closed loop recording of cell activity, Combine with blue voltage indicators, Better than other red-shifted opsins currently available, Improved light sensitivity, Improved robustness to elicit action potentials."

Underlying genetic variants or environmental factors can contribute to disease pathology through disruption of gene regulatory processes, which can result in altered downstream molecular physiology (e.g. insufficient levels of signaling proteins). Because the status of regulatory function in an individual cannot be determined from genetic sequence alone, comprehensive clinical assessment requires direct molecular profiling of regulatory components and processes. Current methods for disease risk assessment and diagnosis test for genetic variants as well as protein expression, but do not consider established knowledge of regulatory dysfunction in disease. This invention addresses the unmet need for regulatory biomarker profiling to incorporate regulatory functional status into diagnosis and prognosis. This invention allows for assessment of regulatory profiling from peripheral tissues, such as blood, which are easily and routinely collected as part of the typical course of clinical care.\n\nApplications: Markers that can be used in diagnostics for diseases where a transcription factor binding event plays a role., Used to adjust disease risk profiles for healthy individuals, as with typical genetic variants.\n\nAdvantages: Existing methods for disease risk calculations rely on genetic markers, which are one more degree separated from the biology involved in disease. For diseases where a single protein product is known to be altered in the disease, diagnostics can be done at the protein level, but these are difficult to develop in a high-throughput fashion. Transcription factor binding can be used as an effective, biologically-relevant biomarker that can be rapidly and cost-effectively developed.."

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social impairments (e.g. diminished eye gaze, abnormal face and emotional processing and impaired social judgement) and the presence of restricted/repetitive behaviors. Several medications are available to treat associated behaviors in autism, but they have negative side effects and are ineffective at improving social abilities.  Research has shown that AVP plays a critical role in promoting mammalian social behavior.  As such, the inventors investigated the use of AVP as a potential treatment for autism.  They conducted a small pilot clinical trial of intranasal AVP in children with autism.  The results of this trial were promising and suggest AVP may be useful for treating social impairments associated with autism.\nStage of research\nThe inventors conducted a pilot double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to test the efficacy and tolerability of 4-week intranasal administration of AVP to children aged 6-12 with ASD.

Stanford University,Therapeutic to restore vision loss,Docket #: S18-081,Published Application: WO2020102374,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/therapeutic-restore-vision-loss,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a new therapeutic to promote survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerve regeneration after traumatic injury or optic neuropathies.  Visual information is conveyed from the eye to the brain via the optic nerve, which contains the axons of the RGCs. Traumatic injury or optic neuropathies can damage RGCs and the optic nerve causing permanent vision loss. Currently there are no approved medicines or therapies to protect or restore vision after RGC and optic nerve damage. Recent work by the inventors has identified a new regulatory mechanism that is important for RGC survival and optic nerve regeneration in disease.  Based on these findings the Stanford researchers have developed a new therapeutic to provide long-lasting RGC neuroprotection.  The therapeutic uses an AAV-gene therapy vector to deliver a specific peptide to the RGC. This, in turn, provides elevated cAMP levels which promote RGC survival and axon regeneration.

Rare-earth (erbium, ytterbium, etc.) doped optical fibers are attractive optical gain providing devices (i.e. fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers), but power output is limited due to internal heat generation, which requires active cooling often in the form of bulky heat sinks, messy water-based coolers, and expensive temperature controllers.  To eliminate bulk and increase performance, the Digonnet Group at Stanford tailors the fiber core and cladding doping to create a laser core, and a cooling cladding layer.  The core pump creates gain at the lasing wavelength in the core, while the cladding-pump source creates anti-Stokes fluorescence cooling in the cladding ions. The cladding diameter and doping is determined by how much cooling is required to offset core heat generation. To maintain optimal temperature along the fiber, the cladding diameter can vary along the length.

Knee osteoarthritis in particular is sensitive to mechanical factors associated with the biomechanics of walking. Researchers at Stanford have developed two inventions to help slow the rate of cartilage deterioration in the knee. One invention describes a method to alter the knee adduction moment by modifying shoe sole stiffness. Focusing on shoe sole stiffness provides a number of advantages over the existing practice of making changes to the angle of the shoe sole or using shoe wedges, including improved comfort and a decreased tendency for the subject to adopt a gait that potentially reduces the effectiveness of the intervention. The other invention, a feedback device for gait retraining, helps the subject maintain a new gait pattern by providing constant feedback regarding weight placement and other factors. Currently, subjects seeking feedback on how they are walking are basically limited to receiving verbal instructions from a clinician. The feedback device can be used to help continually remind subjects to maintain a modified gait pattern that alters the peak knee adduction moment. Both of these inventions offer simple, non-invasive, and relatively risk free solutions which may help to slow the progression of knee osteoarthritis.\n\nApplications: Lower the knee adduction moment to slow the rate of medial compartment cartilage deterioration in the knee, or increase the knee adduction moment to slow the rate of lateral compartment cartilage deterioration of the knee..\n\nAdvantages: Simple, Non-invasive, Relatively risk free, The shoe sole stiffness invention offers improved comfort over existing methods of shoe modification for gait intervention., The biofeedback invention provides continuous, accurate information about the subject's gait, allowing for more effective retraining.."

Stanford University,Steering Wheel Skin Stretch Haptic Feedback System,Docket #: S16-288,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/steering-wheel-skin-stretch-haptic-feedback-system,"Engineers in Prof. Mark Cutkosky's laboratory have patented a compact, intuitive, haptic vehicle feedback system that communicates multi-dimensional information to drivers through the grip of the steering wheel. Current vehicle steering feedback systems rely on vibration (which only delivers discrete """"on/off"""" information), sound and vision (which compete for a driver's attention with other auditory or visual tasks), and handwheel torque (which disrupts manual steering).  Prof. Cutkosky's  lab's alternative applies small shear forces to stretch the skin on the driver's hand, which communicates rich analog cues, including magnitude and direction information. The system provides a tactile signal regardless of the driver's hand position and does not affect the steering control. It is easy to program and control and is naturally reflexive for the driver, allowing instantaneous comprehension. This tool can be used for navigation, semi-autonomous vehicle intention notification, driver training, and safety applications to improve situational awareness.\nClose-up view of the skin stretch produced by the steering wheel. Ring at front of the rim (highlighted yellow on left) can be gripped anywhere and can rotate 0.5 degrees, producing 2.5mm of skin stretch.\nStage of Development- Prototype\nThe inventors tested a prototype in a realistic on-road environment while driving a vehicle in suburban traffic. They demonstrated that drivers could easily perceive skin stretch cues and distinguish between a set of four stimuli of varying direction and displacement with reasonable accuracy even when competing against other sources of vibration as well as distractions inherent in driving. In a follow-up study, they found drivers could easily navigate an unknown course using only skin stretch cues, and these cues were better than auditory cues in the presence of a distracting task such as a phone call.\n\nApplications: Human vehicle interface - quickly and intuitively communicate information from the car to the driver with end-user applications such as:, safety - collision avoidance, lane keeping, blind spot detection, low traction warnings, navigation and trajectory planning, autonomous vehicles, driver training for cars, trucks and heavy equipment.\n\nAdvantages: Rich haptic feedback:, skin stretch provides analog signals having magnitude and direction, which communicates more information than discrete vibration event cues, fast, noticeable, intuitive, and naturally reflexive cues that humans are accustomed to with everyday object manipulation, tactile feedback that does not saturate the already heavily used visual and auditory channels, does not lead to desensitization, Compact, seamless integration into steering wheel - surrounds whole steering wheel in continuous manner, provides effective feedback cues regardless of grip style, same size and shape as ordinary steering wheel, low power and fewer actuators than vibration cues, skin stretch does not interfere with steering dynamics (unlike handwheel torque which is coupled with the steering system), Easy to program and control - simple, low-power DC motor for actuation and optical encoders for sensing."

This biomimetic scaffold targets the delivery of focal adhesion kinase inhibitors (FAKIs), anti-scarring agents that attenuate fibrotic activity (Stanford Docket S11-417). By directly targeting the active agent to a large wound, this pullulan collagen biomatrix can avoid the toxicity from systemic oral delivery and can deliver the drug over larger areas than are possible with injection. In addition, the rate of drug delivery can be adjusted by molecular imprinting techniques, tailoring the hydrogel to the nature of the wound. Therefore, the drug formulation can be delivered either rapidly (for applications such as surgical excisions) or sustained over time (for applications such as burns). This combination of biomimetic scaffolds with pro-regenerative small molecules (FAKIs) creates a potent regenerative therapeutic ready for near term clinical translation for enhanced wound healing and regeneration of large and deep dermal wounds.\nPhotographs of full-thickness contact burn wounds treated with and without FAKI hydrogel show improved wound healing with FAKI hydrogel treatment (H+FAKI).\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have developed two distinct drug-laden pullulan collagen hydrogels, one for rapid release and one for sustained release.

Stanford University,An Algorithm for Maximum-SAR Targeted Hyperthermia,Docket #: S14-468,"Published Application: 20160334477, Issued: 10,088,537 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/algorithm-maximum-sar-targeted-hyperthermia,"Magnetic resonance (MR) thermometry is a fast and noninvasive method for\nperforming the necessary temperature mapping. Typically, the heating apparatus (RF or microwave applicator) and imaging apparatus (MR RF tranceiver coil) are separate pieces of hardware, which can be cumbersome and pose practical complications. At high static field strengths, the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation in MRI is small enough that localized hotspots result from constructive interference of electric fields. For the purpose of imaging, this phenomenon is problematic since the hotspots (quantified by the specific absorption rate, SAR) can violate regulatory limits. For this reason parallel transmission with a multichannel RF coil is used in high field MRI as a way to homogenize electric and magnetic field distributions. The additional degrees of freedom introduced through parallel transmission, while initially intended for hotspot mitigation in imaging, can be repurposed for localized hotspot generation in hyperthermia.\nStanford researchers have developed an efficient algorithm for determining the optimal channel weightings to maximize the SAR over an arbitrary target region of a particular patient while constraining SAR elsewhere to be below regulatory local SAR limits. The algorithm is efficient enough that it can be performed in real-time in an iterative manner to ensure accuracy.\nThis invention can be used with MRI RF coils operating at sufficiently high frequencies (300 MHz) to perform interleaved imaging and hyperthermia with a single apparatus. This will allow a convenient method for monitored thermal therapy in an efficient and noninvasive manner.\n\nApplications: Localized chemotherapy;, Ablation of tumors;, Cardiac stimulation.\n\nAdvantages: Hyperthermia and imaging can be accomplished with a single RF apparatus, making such a system much less cumbersome than current methods with separate pieces of hardware., The speed of the algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than what would be possible using other SAR formalisms, allowing for the real-time iterative optimization described., The optimization can be performed for arbitrary target locations without a separate time-consuming EM simulation.."

Variable suspension systems can help mimic an important characteristic of animals: controlling the stiffness of their limbs through their muscles. This feature can be electrically manipulated and tuned through electroactive polymer suspensions (see Stanford Docket S12-067). To improve the basic suspension technology, the inventors developed manufacturing methods to easily fabricate uniform thin layers of electroactive polymer films on an expandable and contractible electrode. The multiple layers of the resulting electrostrictive element reduce stress concentration which then increases the overall force and stiffness of the suspension system while also improving reliability and lifetime.

Stanford University,"Unsupervised identification, matching, display and quantitation of subsets (clusters) by exhaustive projection pursuit methods",Docket #: S18-146,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/unsupervised-identification-matching-display-and-quantitation-subsets-clusters,"When examining one or higher dimensional data, researchers frequently aim to identify individual subsets (clusters) of objects within the dataset. With high-dimensional data (>3 dimensions), the data become progressively more sparsly distributed in space. This, in turn, progressively increases the influence of the “curse of dimensionality” and thereby makes subset identification progressively more difficult. To address this issue, we developed a pipeline of fully-automated sequential analysis methods that together provide statistically robust cluster idenfication and cluster matching tools for data generated with flow/mass cytometry and/or other technologies.\n\nApplications: We foresee that the methods we describe here with respect to flow cytometry data will be applicable to data generated by a wide variety of commercial and academic technologies including, for example, demographic data, retail marketing data, census data, etc..\n\nAdvantages: The traditional approach to locating clusters (subsets) in high-dimensional (Hi-D) datasets such as those acquired by flow cytometry is to reduce their dimensionality, usually by linear and/or nonlinear one/two dimensional mapping or projection strategies. This Projection Pursuit approach has been known since 1974 to be a very efficient method of analyzing high dimensional data in a way that avoids the curse of dimensionality '1"""". Indeed, much of what is known about stem cells, blood cells and diseases such as leukemia and AIDS relies on flow cytometry data analyzed with manual Projection Pursuit methods (i.e., using """"manual gating"""" such as that offered by FlowJo and other flow data analysis packages). However, the resolution of such subsets is by no means routine with the available manual analysis tools. Further, because such analysis methods ultimately rely on user skills to manually define subset boundaries and other properties, subset identification and quantitation is still more appropriately recognized as art rather than science. Automating this data analysis process and making it more objective is clearly desirable. In fact, several groups have recently developed intensive computational approaches aimed at simultaneously identifying the subsets (clusters) within a given Hi-D dataset '2"""". These attempts at Hi-D clustering methods are well motivated from a biomedical and user functionality point of view. However, they are perforce highly sensitive to compromise by what statisticians refer to as """"the curse of dimensionality"""", a well-known statistical problem that compromises both statistical validity and computational performance of Hi-D clustering methods 'Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., Friedman, J. The elements of statistical learning. (Springer-Verlag, 2009)"""". Indeed, as we have shown '3"""", the curse of dimensionality clearly militates against the use of simultaneous Hi-D clustering methods for flow/mass cytometry and other high-dimensional data. Nevertheless, biomedical and other disciplines that rest on cluster analysis of multiparameter data require a solution to this problem. To develop objective, statistically valid and computationally efficient cluster identification methods, we started with the basic ideas underlying previous automated two-dimensional (2D) Exhaustive Projection Pursuit approaches '1"""". Basically, in such approaches 1) Hi-D data is presented as a collection of 2D linear projections; 2) every 2D projection is then characterized by a numerical index that indicates the amount of structure that is present '4""""; 3) this index is then used as the basis for a heuristic search to locate the most """"useful"""" 2D projection; 4) once the projection with the most useful structure has been found, this structure is then segmented and each portion is recursively analyzed until there is no remaining structure detectable. In general, these Projection Pursuit methods are a big step forward towards solving the problem of Hi-D data analysis since they avoid the curse of dimensionality. However, the approaches advanced thus far have some key limitations, e.g., it is neither obvious nor trivial to specify what constitutes structures in data and how to make inferences from such identified structures. To overcome these limitations, we have developed unsupervised Exhaustive Projection Pursuit (EPP) methods that use the smallest misclassification error across a decision boundary between identified clusters (using DBM method '5"""") as an index to identify the most profitable 2D projection. To facilitate inference from recursive EPP outcomes, we introduced multidimensional cluster matching and display methods that together with the EPP provide rapid unsupervised cluster (subset) recognition, display and characterization. These EPP analysis methods, which we describe here, provide statistically robust clustering tools for flow/mass cytometry and are readily applicable to similar types of single- or multi-dimensional data generated by other technologies.."
Stanford University,Neuro-navigation device for localization of internal anatomical regions,Docket #: S17-412,"Issued: 11,291,852 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/neuro-navigation-device-localization-internal-anatomical-regions,"Stanford researchers in the McNab lab have developed a marker-less neuro-navigation device that only needs to be setup once during the first transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) session and by tracking the subjects head, automatically achieves the same accurate coil location and orientation during follow-up treatment sessions. TMS is a clinical treatment for depression where the same brain region needs to be localized 5 times a week over the course of 4-6 weeks. The recurring need to localize the same brain area make it the ideal application for this device.  Such a device can track and save coil location and orientation without the need for prior MRI, collecting valuable data that can relate TMS coil targeting with treatment outcome. A dataset that contains head shape, coil placement and treatment outcome can then be used to develop much more effective TMS treatment protocols.\nStage of – Prototype  \nUsing facial feature tracking the McNab lab head tracking technique successfully located the same scalp location during follow-up sessions within 2mm accuracy for 30cm camera distance and within 5mm for 60cm camera distance if the face is looking at the camera within an angle of less than 40degree.\n\nApplications: Neuro-navigation during TMS, Other clinical applications that need localization of internal organs.\n\nAdvantages: Low cost, Short setup time, Precise and consistent, More accurate than current “5cm rule” targeting method, Needs only one calibration, Markerless – links internal anatomical regions with externally visible landmarks such as eyes ,nose and head, Easier to use compared to current marker-based clinical navigation devices, Increased accuracy and treatment outcome compared to no navigation."
Stanford University,Method for the selection of PHB-producing methanotrophic cultures,Docket #: S10-320,"Published Application: 20130052681, Issued: 9,062,340 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/method-selection-phb-producing-methanotrophic-cultures,"Researchers in Dr. Craig Criddle's lab have developed a method for enriching microorganisms with high poly(3-hydroxy)butyrate (PHB) production in non-sterile mixed culture conditions.  PHB is a carbon storage polymer produced by a wide variety of microorganisms and is useful as a commercial thermoplastic.  As environmental concerns increase over the production and disposal of petrochemical-based plastic, there is a growing incentive to produce inexpensive alternatives.  PHB may provide such an alternative as it is renewable, rapidly biodegradable and non-toxic. However, conventional processes to produce PHB require pure cultures and costly sterilization procedures and thus are not attractive for large scale production.  To overcome these limitations, the inventors have developed a method that reliably selects for PHB producing microorganisms from  diverse cultures under non-sterile operational conditions over extended time periods.\nStage of research\nThe inventors have shown that their method effectively selects for PHB producing microorganisms in non-sterile mixed culture conditions.\n\nApplications: Bioplastic- alternative to petrochemical-based plastic.\n\nAdvantages: No sterilization requirements, Enables adaptation, Permits use of mixed substrates, Does not limit growth rates or selectivity of PHB producing microorganisms, Low cost, Well suited for continuous processes and large scale production."
Stanford University,Mobilizing anti-tumor immunity by targeting chemerin receptor CCRL2,Docket #: S15-050,"Published Application: 20170002087, Issued: 9,868,792 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/mobilizing-anti-tumor-immunity-targeting-chemerin-receptor-ccrl2,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a new, patented strategy to enhance anti-tumor immune responses to treat cancer.  Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States and inflicts a tremendous burden on public health. Harnessing the immune system to destroy tumor cells is a promising therapeutic strategy. However, most current cancer immunotherapies selectively activate only a limited repertoire of anti-tumor immune defenses and often have incomplete efficacy.  To overcome these limitations, the inventors have developed a new strategy to facilitate recruitment of anti-tumor immune cells into tumor tissue by exploiting chemerin.  Chemerin is a chemoattractant that directs recruitment of anti-tumor immune cells, including NK cells. The inventors have identified a chemerin-sequestering receptor, CCRL2, which restricts chemerin-dependent recruitment of tumor fighting immune cells.  This technology provides methods of inhibiting CCRL2 to enhance the anti-tumor immune response to treat cancer.\nStage of research\nInitial studies have shown great promise.  Additional development and validation is ongoing.\n\nApplications: Cancer immunotherapy.\n\nAdvantages: New therapeutic strategy, Facilitates anti-tumor immune defenses independent of existing immunotherapeutics, Works though a non-checkpoint inhibitor pathway to slow tumor growth, Synergies with emerging checkpoint inhibitor and conventional chemotherapeutic approaches, Mobilizes the endogenous immune defenses to attract a broader and more cohesive repertoire of immune cells."

Its design uses a spatially adjustable LED backlight that is controlled to minimize power consumption by way of an algorithm that decomposes the image into LED and LCD components. This display technology delivers a high maximum brightness that is roughly an order of magnitude brighter than current LCD screens ( at 2000 cd/m2), and manages an excellent 20,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio - making it well suited for high dynamic range applications.

The mice treated with the GBP1 inhibitors showed tumor regression after 42 days of treatment.\nTarget - GBP1 (Guanylate-Binding Protein 1) - a large GTPase which plays a major role in cancer cells stressed by hypoxia or a low supply of nutrients.\nBackground – Resistance to radiation therapy and current chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel, carboplatin and doxorubicin is a major cause of cancer treatment failure.  The failure of first line chemo- and radiation therapy, particularly in ovarian cancer, emphasizes the need for new targeted drugs that can counteract resistance. GBP1 binds to pro-survival kinases such as serine/threonine-protein kinase pim-1 (PIM1) in the cytoskeleton and initiates a signaling pathway that induces resistance to taxane-based drugs and radiation therapy. GBP1 overexpression has been associated with paclitaxel and radioresistance in ovarian cancer and enhanced cell invasion in glioblastoma multiforme. GBP1 has also been implicated in resistance to radiation therapy in HNC patients. Compounds that inhibit GBP1 could close the “backdoor” of therapy resistance.\nMode of action - GBP1 is an upstream mediator of treatment resistance. Inhibiting the GBP1 active site disrupts GBP1:PIM1 interaction, antagonizes the pro-survival effects of PIM1 and mediates other treatment re-sensitizing effects. Overall, these compounds switch off a gateway of drug resistance and restore sensitivity to taxane and radiation therapy.\nCompetitive edge - First-in-class approach to an unmet medical need.\nPatent status - Patent application filed"

During ACT, tumor-specific lymphocytes are expanded ex vivo and then administered to the patient as a therapeutic to treat cancer. Sometime these T cells are also engineered with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) that enable these cells to specifically recognize and kill cancer cells.  TSCM cells are a subset of memory lymphocytes that have a stem cell-like ability to self-renew and the multipotent capacity to differentiate into memory and effector T cell subsets.  Increasing the numbers of TSCM cells has been suggested as a way to improve the efficacy of ACT therapies.  Current approaches to do so, however, are limited as TSCM cells constitute a very rare subset of T cells that are hard to obtain and culture.  Thus, new methods are needed to enhance the TSCM population.  To help meet this need, the inventors have developed a method that uses drugs to disrupt specific signaling pathways during T cell activation to skew T cell differentiation to the TSCM phenotype.  This technology provides a simple non-genetic method for the expansion of T cells ex vivo in a manner that greatly enhances the number of TSCM cells.  It has the potential to improve clinical outcomes for cancer immunotherapy patients.\nStage of research\nPreliminary data shows that culturing CAR-T cells in the presence of ibrutinib can endow a more TSCM phenotype, reduce expression of inhibitory receptors, and enhance functionality.\n\nApplications: Adoptive cell transfer therapies, including:, Expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T lymphocytes.\n\nAdvantages: Steers T cell fate toward the TSCM phenotype and improves the quality of T cells transferred, TSCM cells are clinically favorable for ACT therapies due to their excellent engraftment, persistence, and efficacy against cancer cells, Potential to improve clinical outcomes for cancer immunotherapy patients."

This is achieved by controlling three properties simultaneously, metamerism, infrared solar absorption, and radiative cooling.  Previous works have focused on one of the three aspects, for example, only radiative cooling.\nTheoretical calculations show a large possible tunable range of radiative thermal load for objects with the same color (680-866 Wm-2). An experimental demonstration showed that two photonic structures with the same pink color could differ by over 47 oC and can be 20 oC either cooler or hotter compared with a commercial paint with a comparable color.

Three-dimensional hierarchical porous carbon materials with flower-like superstructures provide highly accessible surface area and facilitate ion transport for high-rate capability which is valuable for energy applications. However, traditional synthesis of these geometries has been difficult and produced low quality materials that do not have regular, predictable structures. This new tunable process solves that problem using a one-pot, free-radical polymerization and self-assembly process that controls structure and porosity through solvents and co-monomers. The resulting carbon particles have uniform structure and desirable electrical properties. This method opens the possibility to synthesize carbon materials in a simple and controlled way with unique morphology, high surface area and tunable heteroatom content for future applications in electrochemical energy conversion and storage, such as supercapacitors, electrocatalysts and lithium-sulfur batteries, waste water treatment and gas storage.\nSynthesis of carbon flower superstructures: This schematic image shows the variety of structures formed by varying the solvents for this simple polymerization process.

Stanford University,Inhibiting Barite Scale Precipitation in Hydraulic Fracturing,Docket #: S18-329,"Issued: 11,187,051 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/inhibiting-barite-scale-precipitation-hydraulic-fracturing,"Barite scale formation in hydraulic fracturing systems is a significant problem with regards to production and permanent formation damage.  Barite added to drilling mud (20-60 wt.% barite) used in these systems is a significant source of barium and sulfate which is not stable in the presence of 15% hydrochloric acid commonly injected at the beginning of stimulation in unconventional systems.  The release of barium and sulfate from drilling mud is deleterious because these dissolved constituents will be transported from areas with high volume/porosity (near bore-hole) to regions with very small volume/porosity (distal fractures, micro-/nano-pores, pore necks, etc.) where it can precipitate as barite further reducing porosity/permeability in extremely low permeability shales.  A Stanford researcher developed a chemical formulation that stabilizes barite in the drilling mud preventing the dissolution and transport of barium and sulfate into the fracture/pore network while maintaining similar acidity as 15% hydrochloric acid. To combat scale, a combination of sulfuric acid (~6%) and sodium citrate is injected into the subsurface instead of the 15% hydrochloric acid currently being used.  The sulfuric acid stabilizes the barite while the sodium citrate chelates  calcium released from the dissolution of calcite in the rocks, inhibiting both barite and gypsum formation in shales.  To further combat gypsum formation, mixtures of hydrochloric and sulfuric acid can be used in conjunction with sodium citrate to adjust for rocks with varying calcite and clay concentrations. This formulation modification can be tailored to specific shales that an operator is interested in stimulating. This formulation will significantly aid in mitigating barite scale common in hydraulic fracturing systems which can lead to an increase in the overall production and recovery of natural gas or crude oil in unconventional oil/gas systems.\n\nApplications: Oil and gas hydraulic fracturing.\n\nAdvantages: 800-fold reduction in released barium and sulfate from drilling mud., Stabilizes the barite, eliminating barite scale formation in shale for both low-carbonate/high-clay and high-carbonate/low-clay rocks., Mitigates secondary mineral precipitation of gypsum in low-carbonate/high-clay rocks, and significantly reduces gypsum formation in high-carbonate/low-clay rocks.., Increases oil and gas production from shale., Easily integrates into current drilling practices - does not require industry to alter the weighing agent (barite) added to the drilling mud to prevent well bore blowout at depth.."

Early diagnosis and treatment are vital for improving lung cancer survival rates, and tissue biopsy is necessary for diagnosis. However, performing a lung biopsy can be difficult because of the complexity of the highly branched airways of the lung, making it difficult to access and obtain the tissue and the procedure can pose a risk to the patient. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) is the safest way to obtain a biopsy but its diagnostic success is limited by poor real time visualization of significant portions of the lung. A major drawback to this method is the difficulty to visualize the lung airways in real-time in order to guide a bronchoscope.    Should the biopsy procedure be unsuccessful, patients may then need to have the tissue surgically removed. In a high number of these cases, the nodules are found to be benign. This system will greatly improve the ability to obtain a diagnosis for the patient using ENB.\nStage of Research:\nEx vivo proof of concept showing detailed bronchogram in a pig lung\n\nApplications: Lung imaging to visualize the airways under fluoroscopic x-ray;, Guided navigation during bronchoscopic guided lung nodule biopsy and treatment procedures; and, Diagnosis of peripheral airway diseases such as asthma and COPD and infectious processes such as pneumonia or atelectasis..\n\nAdvantages: Correct bronchoscopic positioning;, More accurate navigation in the lung; and, Higher diagnostic success rate for pulmonary nodule biopsies using ENB.."

An energy efficient Li2S electrode design is crucial for industrial manufacturing of Li-S batteries, a lightweight and high performance alternative to Li-ion batteries. The redox mediator (RM) acts as a charge shuttle (see figure 1).  It 'patrols' the cathode to react with Li2S particles that are not in contact with current collectors, facilitates electron transport, and improves efficiency.\nFigure 1 Direct oxidation of Li2S vs. mediated oxidation\nStage of Research\nStanford researchers designed and employed a small molecule in the electrolyte as a redox mediator.

Opioids are ligands that bind to the mu, delta, and/or kappa opioid receptors.   They are used to treat pain, diarrhea, and for overdose reversal. Current opioid therapeutics have severe side effects including respiratory depression and addiction.  Thus, it would be highly beneficial to develop safer opioid therapeutics without such severe side effects. To help achieve this goal the inventors have used a new computational method, which leverages crystallography and molecular modeling with machine learning (see Stanford Docket S17-431), to explore a new chemical space of molecules active at opioid receptors.  This technology describes the discovery of three fundamentally new chemical scaffolds that bind the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors.  The novelty of these scaffolds will serve as the basis for further lead optimization that can generate a new family of opioids with varying receptor selectivity and agonism.

Stanford University,Data-Driven Urban Energy Benchmarking of Buildings (DUE-B),Docket #: S17-505,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/data-driven-urban-energy-benchmarking-buildings-due-b,"Stanford researchers have developed a Data-driven Urban Energy Benchmarking  (DUE-B) methodology that uses readily available building energy consumption data to help municipalities design and develop energy efficiency policies and programs.  Cities worldwide are mandating energy use data collection in order to pinpoint energy saving opportunities, but municipalities struggle to convert data into actionable insights. Traditional engineering methods (e.g., Energy Plus) are too detailed for benchmarking thousands of buildings across a city, and EPA's?EnergyStar rankings fail to leverage local data streams. Other methods rely on complex machine learning, which reduces interpretability and the ability to shape energy efficiency programs. Stanford's DUE-B is designed to strike a balance between generalizability and interpretability.  Using recursive partitioning, DUE-B takes a heterogeneous building dataset, breaks it into comparison groups based on a combination of physical features and energy usage, and benchmarks the performance using stochastic frontier analysis.  The result is the ability to benchmark the energy performance of a portfolio of heterogeneous buildings (usually across a city), and identify """"inefficient"""" buildings that can be targeted for incentives and/or retrofits.\nStage of Research\nResearchers validated the DUE-B method using a dataset of over 10,000 New York City buildings.  DUE-B was more robust than other methods (EUI, EnergyStar), and results were easy to interpret.  The methodology is more profound with more detailed input data (e.g., HVAC systems, orientation, exterior enclosure, occupancy behavior, etc.).  Future work includes collaborating with city officials, buildings managers, and other parties to further assess interpretability, and applicability to design and development of energy efficiency policies and programs.\n\nApplications: Municipal energy benchmarking and planning.\n\nAdvantages: Uses readily available energy consumption data, Easy to interpret and to differentiate between random factors and inefficiency, Easier to identify subsets of efficient and inefficient buildings, Scalable for city wide analysis, Scalable for deeper analysis as more detailed data is available."
Stanford University,HIV Latency Reversal Agents that target Chromatin remodeler-driven repressive HIV promoter structure,Docket #: S17-337A,"Published Application: WO2020014524, Published Application: 20210315876, Issued: 11,980,613 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/hiv-latency-reversal-agents-target-chromatin-remodeler-driven-repressive-hiv-promoter,"Disease indication - HIV infection, specifically reversal of viral latency alone or in combination with other latency reversal agents to improve reservoir targeting.\nDrug format - Small molecule: new scaffold for family of novel compounds with a 12-membered macrolactam.\nDrug class - First-in-class of latency reversal agents.\nResearch stage and Preliminary data –\nTarget validation: The inventors demonstrated the effects of these molecules on HIV latency in both an in vitro T cell line and an ex vivo primary cell model of HIV-1 latency. Results showed no toxicity or T cell activation.\nTarget identification and Structure-activity Relationship: The inventors demonstrated the specific sub-unit targeted by the macrolatam scaffold and optimized its activity.\nTarget - These molecules target BAF (mammalian SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex through the BAF-specific subunit ARID1A. BAF is involved in establishing and maintaining viral latency through nucleosome positioning.\nBackground - Patients with HIV-1 infections are currently treated with combination Anti-Retroviral Therapy (cART) which is extremely effective at suppressing HIV-1 to undetectable levels and preventing progression to AIDS. However, cART therapy does not entirely eliminate the virus due to a pool of latently infected cells that persist in the body. This viral reservoir presents a major roadblock to curing HIV infection and therefore patients must maintain cART therapy for life.\nA number of genetic and epigenetic factors establish and maintain latency. Chemically targeting these regulators with the aim to purge the latent reservoir could provide a cure. However, to date, latency reversal agents (LRAs) have been hampered by limited effectiveness or high toxicity, stressing the need for more specific and less toxic compounds. These new LRA agents are selective and non-toxic and could present an avenue to eliminate latent HIV infection to potentially cure the disease without further cART treatment.\nMode of action - The BAF (mammalian SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex is involved in establishing and maintaining viral latency through nucleosome positioning which represses HIV-1 Tat mediated transcription. Target identification experiments implicate ARID1A (a BAF-specific subunit) as the primary target. These molecules target the BAF-specific subunit ARID1A to prevent nucleosomal positioning, relieving transcriptional repression of HIV-1 and reversing latency.\nRelated Technology - These compounds could also be used to treat cancer (see Docket S17-337).\n\nAdvantages: Low toxicity - compound identified in screen for drugs that inhibit BAF-mediated transcription without affecting cellular viability, thereby reducing the chance for side effects, Specific target - selectively targets ARID1A subunit of BAF complex, Enhances the activity of other latency reversal agents, such as those targeting HDACs (histone deacetylases) and PKC (protein kinase c)."

This technology adapts a conventional numerical algorithm (backpropagation) so that it can be implemented experimentally directly on an optical chip. Those physical experiments then provide the input for optimizing the chip toward any designated function. Because photonic circuits are faster, less computationally expensive and more energy efficient than traditional electronic computers, this optics-only in-situ approach is more efficient than conventional training that uses a computational model on an external computer. In addition, the method can be scaled to a large network because it tests and tunes parameters in parallel rather than using brute force serial techniques. This method was originally designed to train artificial neural networks (ANN) in deep learning applications. It could also be utilized to create other complex, adaptive nonlinear photonic circuits with end-user applications such as LiDAR, laser accelerators and optical communications.\nFigure description -   Researchers have shown a neural network can be trained using an optical circuit (blue rectangle in the illustration). In the full network there would be several of these linked together. The laser inputs (green) encode information that is carried through the chip by optical waveguides (black). The chip performs operations crucial to the artificial neural network using tunable beam splitters, which are represented by the curved sections in the waveguides. These sections couple two adjacent waveguides together and are tuned by adjusting the settings of optical phase shifters (red and blue glowing objects), which act like 'knobs' that can be adjusted during training to perform a given task.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have performed optical simulations to demonstrated proof of concept for this training technique by teaching an algorithm to perform complicated functions.\n\nApplications: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) training - optimize photonic hardware platforms for artificial intelligence and machine learning with end-user applications such as speech and image recognition, Photonic devices - methods could be used for sensitivity analysis of any reconfigurable photonic system with end-user applications such as:, LiDAR, laser accelerators, optical communications, scientific research platforms.\n\nAdvantages: Efficient, direct optical training realizes computational efficiency, speed and power advantages gained by using photonic circuits instead of traditional solid-state circuits for artificial networks, training time reduced because parameters are adjusted in parallel, Scalable for large networks, training technique adjusts parameters in parallel, unlike brute force gradient methods which operate in serial, scales with network size by operating in constant time with respect to the number of parameters, Accurate - in-situ training on a physical device avoids model-based methods, which often do not perfectly represent the physical system, Can be implemented with no additional hardware or components."

A team of researchers at Stanford University led by Prof. Yi Cui has developed a low-cost, easily fabricated rechargeable battery (the “mixing entropy battery”) that takes advantage of the difference in salinity between seawater and freshwater to produce electricity. The battery consists of two electrodes – a positive electrode made from nanorods of sodium manganese oxide, and a negative electrode made from silver chloride. Energy extraction occurs by a simple process of the battery being filled with freshwater in its discharged state, then charged with a small electric current, drained, and filled with seawater. Because seawater is salty, containing 60 to 100 times more ions than freshwater, it increases the voltage between the two electrodes, thus making it possible to reap more electricity than the amount used to charge the battery. Prof. Cui's team has achieved 75% efficiency in converting energy to electrical current, and expects to reach 85% efficiency in the future. A power plant using this type of battery could be situated anywhere freshwater runs into the sea, such as an estuary. The researchers calculate that a power plant operating with 50 cubic meters of freshwater per second could produce up to 100 megawatts of power. The water does not have to be extremely clean; storm runoff and gray water could potentially be used.\nThis system could be modified to operate on a smaller scale using solar energy to distill water, with complete recycling of the electrolyte to achieve conversion of solar energy into electrical energy. Also, if the process is reversed, it can potentially be used as a method for water desalination.\n\nApplications: Utility scale battery, Solar energy, Desalination.\n\nAdvantages: Completely renewable source of energy, Minimal environmental footprint, Simple to fabricate, Reduced cost, Doesn't rely on membranes, Overcomes the challenges of supercapacitor electrodes based on activated carbon."

Stanford University,High efficiency electrocatalysis with lung-inspired architecture,Docket #: S17-342,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/high-efficiency-electrocatalysis-lung-inspired-architecture,"Stanford researchers have developed a low-cost, highly efficient system for performing a wide range of electrocatalytic reactions. This technology is designed to mimic the topology of the human lung in order to quickly deliver gas to and from the catalytic surface, thereby enhancing performance.\nThe general structure is formed by a flexible, micron-scale nanoporous membrane that is permeable to gas and not liquid. This membrane is coated with an ultra-thin layer of catalyst and creates a gas-liquid-solid (G-L-S) three-phase interface for highly efficient gas exchange, facilitating a wide range of reactions depending on the catalyst chosen. This compact structure could improve performance of electrocatalytic devices in a broad range of clean energy applications such as fuel cells, metal-air batteries, electrochemical water splitting and CO2 reduction.\nSchematics of the lung-inspired system for efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. A layer of Au catalyst is sputtered on a nanoporous polyethylene membrane (nanoPE), the Au-coated PE membrane is rolled up and sealed into a bilayered structure mimicking a human lung.

The primary end-user application of this technology is for visualizing single fluorescently labeled molecules of interest in biological research.

The depth of an object is encoded into the separation distance between the two lobes. Rotational mobility is assessed by measuring the relative brightness of the two lobes. We term this parameter the lobe asymmetry (LA) of a given object. When the lobes are of similar brightness (i.e. the lobe asymmetry is low), this indicates that an object is highly rotationally mobile. Additionally, using dual-polarization acquisition, another parameter, termed the linear dichroism (LD), may be simultaneously measured for each object, providing further information about rotational dynamics.\n(a) The bisected pupil is implemented using a wedge-based phase mask. When using dual-polariztion acquisition, the blue and red arrows indicate the axis of polarization relative to the phase mask to be used for each of the two polarization channels (T and R indicate the polarization reflected and transmitted by a polarizing beamsplitter). (b) Simulated images of a single molecule as a function of depth. Note that the images in the two polarization channels appear rotated due to the particular geometry of our dual-polarization experimental setup. (c) Experimental calibration data of a fluorescent bead, used to relate lobe separation to depth. (Adapted from reference 1)\n(a) Using a theoretical model for the rotational mobility of single molecules, experimental data was compared to simulation. (b) Image of a single DCDHF-N6 molecule in two polarization channels. The parameters LA and LD are computed from the raw intensities measured from the individual pixels of an acquired image. (c) By measuring the LA and LD of thousands to millions of fluorescent molecules, histograms are constructed, and compared to histograms generated from simulations. By comparing simulation to experimental data, we determine that the rotational mobility within a microtubule sample is very high. (d) By color-coding an image of microtubules according to the LA and LD of individual molecules, we conclude that the rotational mobility is uniform throughout the sample of interest. (Adapted from reference 2)\nSTAGE OF RESEARCH\nThe inventors used the BSP-modulated point-spread function to perform 3D super-resolved reconstructions of fluorescently labeled microtubules in fixed cells and simultaneously demonstrated that the rotational mobilities of the individual fluorescent dye molecules is great enough for accurate spatial localization.

Stanford University,Ultrasound speckle reduction and image reconstruction using deep learning techniques,Docket #: S17-460,Issued: 11030780 (USA),https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/ultrasound-speckle-reduction-and-image-reconstruction-using-deep-learning-techniques,"Stanford researchers at the Dahl Lab have developed a method to reduce artifacts in ultrasound image reconstruction using a trained convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN applies machine-learned filters to the pre-beamformed ultrasound channel signals to suppress artifacts, improving overall image quality.\nBeamforming with neural networks represents a fundamentally different paradigm for speckle reduction as compared to traditional techniques such as DAS, spatial compounding, and nonlocal means. These beamforming speckle filters operate on the original radiofrequency channel signals, rather than on images that have previously been beamformed with DAS, which are subject to DAS artifacts such as clutter. In addition, unlike existing clutter filters, these filters are capable of reducing clutter and speckle simultaneously.\nTo the inventors' knowledge, this is the first method to use an artificial neural network to remove speckle and clutter all in one step from raw signals to final image.\nWorking Prototype\nA working prototype of the method that performs real-time imaging at 30 frames per second.\nStage of Research\n\nApplications: Ultrasound imaging reconstructon.\n\nAdvantages: Improved image quality, Can reduce clutter and speckle simultaneously, Uses machine learning techniques, Believed to be the first use of artificial neural network to remove speckle and clutter all in one step from raw signals to final image."

Until now, the energy density of stretchable lithium ion batteries has been extremely low due to materials with low lithium (Li) storage capabilities, while high performance Li metal has been too brittle for elastic deformation. To enable use of Li metal in stretchable batteries, this technology integrates Li into a hierarchical copper (Cu) spiral which is covered with rubber for flexibility.  This simple design makes the whole electrode highly stretchable with stable electrochemical performances during mechanical stretching/releasing cycles. The anode could enable Li ion batteries that can adapt to the dynamic motions of electronic devices while maintaining good electrochemical performance.\nAnode performance when subjected to stretching during battery charging/discharging\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have demonstrated this anode with a working coin and pouch cell and tested it in over 100 cells.

Stanford University,Screening for compounds to treat obesity and metabolic disease by generating brown fat,Docket #: S12-039,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/screening-compounds-treat-obesity-and-metabolic-disease-generating-brown-fat,"Researchers in Prof. Brian Feldman's laboratory have developed a patented drug screen to identify compounds that could potentially treat obesity and metabolic disease by converting cells to calorie-burning brown fat. This screen identifies individual agents that inhibit the hormone nuclear receptor vitamin D receptor (VDR) and thereby program either adipose precursor cells or other cells (including fibroblasts) to become brown fat. Brown fat is a thermogenic tissue that increases energy expenditure, burning calories and altering systemic metabolism to improve insulin sensitivity. VDR is a critical regulatory component to determine whether fat cells become the brown tissue that expends energy or the white tissue that stores it. VDR inhibitors identified by this screen could offer a first-in-class approach for treating for patients with obesity, diabetes and other metabolic diseases by altering the composition of adipose tissue.\nStage of Development\nInitial studies validated VDR as a target that determines the type of fat produced and that it can be regulated separately from the systemic environment. The inventors established a luciferase reporter system, containing the critical regulatory elements for this process, which enables systematic screening of biologics or small molecules that are competent to target this activity.  In addition, the inventors have completed the first round of screening with this method and are performing functional tests on the top hits from the assay.\n\nApplications: Drug development for obesity and metabolic disease - cellular assay to screen for VDR inhibitor agents that generate brown fat.\n\nAdvantages: First in class approach - to treat obesity and metabolic syndrome by altering the composition of adipose tissue to generate more thermogenic brown fat cells, Identifies single agents - compounds identified by this screen can generate brown fat independently, without genetic modifications or a combination of drugs, Minimize side effects of therapy by identifying compounds that activate brown fat in a context-specific way."

They created two constructs with two negative selection markers to increase the efficiency of homologous recombination in human pluripotent stem cells, both embryonic stem cells (hESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC).  With these tools, the novel gene can be better targeted for studying gene function, lineage tracing and mutation correction.  They also generated a novel eGFP knock-in human ESC line to study endoderm differentiation, oligodendrocytes and hematopoietic stem cells.  Thirdly, they identified three novel surface markers on stem cells to help identify the embryonic endoderm.  This finding provides the ability to isolate endoderm derived from hESC and iPSC for further differentiation to downstream cell types, including pancreatic, liver and intestinal cells.  Since the embryonic endoderm is an inaccessible human tissue, this new technology opens new opportunities to investigate and understand the differentiation of the human endoderm into the functional epithelial compartment of multiple internal organs.\n\nApplications: Gene targeting in human pluripotent stem cells, Evaluation of endoderm differentiation, Screening for conditions to induce the novel gene expression, Study of organogenesis in vitro.\n\nAdvantages: Isolation of purified embryonic endoderm using FACS, Ability to study developmental and molecular process of endoderm, Increased efficiency of hESC targeting, First knock-in hESC line for this locus."

The ability to manipulate immune cells for therapeutic use is of great clinical interest.  Cytokines are signaling molecules that can be used to alter cellular behavior.  IL-2 is a cytokine that plays a key role in the adaptive immune response as its signaling regulates T cell homeostasis by controlling the balance of immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive responses.  For this reason, it is an appealing target for therapeutic development.  However, at clinically relevant doses it is highly toxic.  Thus, new methods that would allow IL-2 therapeutic use with decreased toxicity are needed.

Stanford University,Low-Power CMOS Image Sensor for Object Detection,Docket #: S13-419,"Published Application: WO2015131045, Published Application: 20170064211, Issued: 10,009,549 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/low-power-cmos-image-sensor-object-detection,"Stanford researchers are developing a low-power, CMOS image sensor with embedded feature-extraction for mobile vision applications. Leveraging the fact that vision features are often edge-based, the sensor's readout circuitry digitizes ratios of neighboring pixels (representing edges) rather than absolute pixel values. As a result, scenes with wide variations in lighting can be represented with fewer bits per pixel, and 100X-1000X less power compared to commercial mobile sensors. The approach is ideal for power-constrained applications – wireless sensor nodes, phone cameras, wearable devices and unmanned aerial vehicles. The approach is also cost-effective, as it uses a standard linear pixel array. This technology could enable an """"always on"""" camera that continuously captures features for object-detection, which in turn could extend the capability of both contextual awareness and augmented reality on mobile platforms.\nStage of Research\nResearchers are completing chip architecture designs and performance estimations.

Stanford University,Improved Wound Healing based on Bioconjugation Methods and Click Chemistry,Docket #: S16-388,Published Application: 20200038484,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/improved-wound-healing-based-bioconjugation-methods-and-click-chemistry,"Researchers at Stanford have developed methods using click chemistry to immobilize and concentrate therapeutic factors on a tissue to improve wound healing.  Tissue regeneration is a complex process involving the temporal and spatial interplay between cells and their extracellular milieu.  Often therapeutic approaches to tissue regeneration do not reconstitute this interaction and thus wound healing is limited or impaired.  Previous attempts to improve wound healing by topically applying therapeutic factors and biomolecules are limited as these factors are easily removed or washed away.  Thus, there is a need for better methods to stimulate the regenerative process and foster wound healing.  To help meet this need the inventors have developed this method which uses copper-free click chemistry to enable topical agents and biomolecules to be immobilized and concentrated on the surface of the damaged tissue.  This increases the residence time of therapeutic factors and enables synergistic combinations of multiple proteins to work together.  This method promotes faster, more effective wound healing especially in challenging situations.\nStage of research\nNew in-situ data demonstrating promising regenerative effects after 60 days (see publication below)\n\nApplications: Topical wound healing for:, Injuries to the eye, Diabetic ulcers, Skin injuries, Nerve injury.\n\nAdvantages: Method provides spatial-temporal control over the regenerative process, Increases therapeutic residence time, bioavailability and bioactivity, Click chemistry:, Rapid yet highly specific, Does not require external trigger such as UV light or metal-ion catalyst, Does not require frequent re-administration of active ingredients, Enables synergistic combination of therapeutic agents and biomolecules to work together."

Stanford University,TurboID and miniTurbo- engineered promiscuous biotin ligases for efficient proximity labeling in living cells and organisms,Docket #: S17-352,"Published Application: WO2019143529, Issued: 12,110,522 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/turboid-and-miniturbo-engineered-promiscuous-biotin-ligases-efficient-proximity-labeling,"Researchers at Stanford have engineered two promiscuous biotin ligases for non-toxic, efficient proximity labeling (PL) in living cells and organisms.  PL is a powerful technique for the proteomic analysis of macromolecular complexes, organelles or protein interaction networks.  In PL, a promiscuous labeling enzyme is fused to a protein of interest or targeted to a subcellular region and upon the addition of biotin, the enzyme begins labeling nearby (within a few nanometers) endogenous proteins.  Then the biotin labelled proteins are harvested and identified by mass spectrometry.  Existing PL techniques are not optimal as they require either toxic regents or long labelling times that prevent the study of dynamic structures or processes.  To overcome these limitations the inventors have engineered two mutants of biotin ligase, called TurboID and miniTurbo, which are both more active and efficient than existing variants.  TurboID and miniTurbo enable PL with greater signal in shorter time windows under physiologically relevant conditions in live cells.  This technology will expand the scope and utility of PL by enabling the study of dynamic processes in vivo and thus can provide insight into proteomic changes to aid general research and therapeutic development.\nProximity-dependent biotinylation by promiscuous biotin ligases. Ligases catalyze the formation of biotin-5'-AMP anhydride, which diffuses out of the active site to biotinylate proximal endogenous proteins.\nStage of research\nIn addition to shortening PL time by 100-fold and increasing PL yield in cell culture, the inventors have shown that TurboID enabled biotin-based PL in new settings including yeast, Drosophila and C. elegans.\nRelated technologies\nResearchers in the Ting lab have also developed additional technologies to detect protein-protein interactions.

This provides a win-win relationship between the utility companies, who may provide the global coordination, and the DER providers who may provide the local control.\nFigure 1 - Smart grid with new technologies in the power transmission system\n\nApplications: Electric grid – planning and operation.\n\nAdvantages: Increased efficiency and balanced load decreases outages, and increases profits., Faster and more robust – high delay tolerance makes the system less vulnerable to communication network failures, and reduces the need to upgrade the smart meter infrastructure to provide faster data propagation., Increased collaboration between the utility companies and the DER providers instead of the current state of competition and distrust.."

Stanford University,Automated single cell expression profiling in intact tissue by highly multiplexed in situ hybridization,Docket #: S16-313,Published Application: 20200224243,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/automated-single-cell-expression-profiling-intact-tissue-highly-multiplexed-situ,"A team of Stanford researchers has developed a highly sensitive, single molecule in situ hybridization system called Proximity Ligation- in situ hybridization (PLISH), which merges the specificity of proximity ligation, the sensitivity of probe tiling, and the high signal intensity of rolling circle amplification. PLISH enables efficient, high level multiplexing by iterative detect-image-erase cycles of four transcripts per round following a single hybridization step, with automated calculation of single cell expression profiles. Downstream data analysis can include clustering algorithms and t-SNE display, but unlike with tissue dissociative approaches for single cell profiling, spatial and morphological data is retained for each cell. Thus, PLISH enables spatial re-mapping of individual cells or cell classes back onto the tissue, allowing for inference of signaling centers, for instance, by localizing cells expressing ligands and cognate receptors. PLISH is highly versatile, performing well on archival FFPE (formalin fixed, paraffin embedded) or cryo-embedded tissue, and is compatible with conventional immunostaining for correlation of RNA and protein expression. PLISH is technically simple and inexpensive, employing conventional fluorescence microscopy and open source software, and can therefore be performed by any laboratory without requiring investment in new equipment.\nThis technology can be used in combination with immunohistochemistry on primary tissue samples, including formalin-fixed and cryopreserved patient samples. Because PLISH is inexpensive and technically simple, it can be used by even non-expert biomedical researchers for in situ profiling to provide spatial context of newly-defined cell populations and reveal mechanistic aspects of human disease pathophysiology either alone or in conjunction with single-cell sequencing. In addition, it could potentially be adapted for diagnostics applications such as liquid biopsy or rare cell identification.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have demonstrated the utility of PLISH for rapid, automated and unbiased cell-type classification by measuring five distinct RNA species in cryopreserved and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung tissue from mouse and human.

Currently, red GECIs (such as jRGECO1a) are limited because they accumulate in the lysosome, thus reducing their signal. To overcome this problem, this new GECI (sRGECO) has improved cellular trafficking so that it will remain in the cytosol. This results in far superior base-line fluorescence, decay kinetics, signal-to-noise ratio, and changes in signal amplitude. In addition, as a red indicator, sRGECO's excitation wavelength can penetrate deeper with less cell damage than wavelengths for green indicators. Because calcium is one of the most versatile and universal signaling agents, this GECI could be used in a wide variety of long-term, repetitive and unbiased functional assays of specific cell types.

Stanford University,CLOuD9- a method for CRISPR-mediated chromosomal looping,Docket #: S16-369,"Published Application: 20180355344, Issued: 11,293,018 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/cloud9-method-crispr-mediated-chromosomal-looping,"Researchers at Stanford and their collaborators have developed a targeted, reversible method to manipulate chromatin structure.  Chromatin folding within the nucleus and, further, the chromosomal contacts created by the 3D organization of chromatin are critical to gene expression regulation.  As such, it would be beneficial to have a comprehensive understanding of the functional organization and formation of chromatin loops.  However, this is lacking as there are no tools to help achieve such an understanding.  To overcome this limitation the inventors have developed CLOuD9 (Chromosomal Loop Reorganization using CRISPR-dCas9) to selectively and reversibly establish chromatin loops.  CLOuD9 uses nuclease deficient Cas9 variants fused to reversible, chemically-induced dimerization proteins and standard guide RNAs (gRNAs) to direct the dCas9 components to the targeted locus.  Addition of the chemical inducer forces juxtaposition of the targeted genomic loci to create a loop.  This technology provides a broadly applicable method to modify chromatin loops and selectively modulate gene expression.\nSchematic of CLOuD9 induced looping.  Addition of abscisic acid (ABA, green) brings two complementary CLOuD9 constructs (red and blue) into proximity, remodeling the chromatin structure.

Stanford University,"Paperfuge: a low-cost, high-speed, human-powered centrifuge",Docket #: S15-444,"Issued: 11,331,665 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/paperfuge-low-cost-high-speed-human-powered-centrifuge,"Researchers at Stanford have developed the paperfuge- an ultra-low cost (20 cents), light weight (2g) field portable centrifuge  (125,000 rpm; 30,000 g RCF) made out of paper that runs on human power.  Sample preparation, including separation of plasma from whole blood or isolation of parasites, is an unmet challenge in many point of care (POC) diagnostics and requires centrifugation as the first key step. From the context of global health applications, commercial centrifuges are expensive, bulky and electricity-powered; leading to a critical bottle-neck in the development of decentralized, electricity-free POC diagnostic devices. By uncovering the fundamental mechanics of an ancient whirligig toy (3300 B.C.E), the inventors designed an ultra-low cost (20 cents), light-weight (2 g), human-powered centrifuge that is made out of paper (""""paperfuge""""). To push the operating limits of this unconventional centrifuge, they presented an experimentally-validated theoretical model that describes the paperfuge as a non-linear, non-conservative oscillator system. The inventors used this model to inform their design process, achieving speeds of 125,000 rpm and equivalent centrifugal forces of 30,000 g, with theoretical limits predicting one million rpm. They harnessed these speeds to separate pure plasma in less than 1.5 minutes and isolate malaria parasites in 15 minutes from whole human blood. By expanding the materials used, the inventors implemented centrifugal microfluidics using PDMS, plastic and 3D-printed devices, ultimately opening up new opportunities for electricity-free POC diagnostics, especially in resource-poor settings.  This technology provides a much needed centrifugation tool for POC diagnostics in resource poor settings and the simplicity of manufacturing the paperfuge will enable immediate mass distribution.\nStage of research\nThe inventors have already demonstrated the utility of the Paperfuge for diagnostic applications by separating plasma from human blood in 1.5 minutes, with no user fatigue; and separation of malaria parasites.  Field testing in resource poor settings is currently under way.\n\nApplications: Centrifugation of biological samples for:, Medical assays- including hematocrit (anemia detection), Point-of-care diagnostics- including malaria, African trypanosomiasis and numerous other diagnostics applications, Lab and field research; ecological sample collection and preservation, Versatile scientific tools for education and outreach.\n\nAdvantages: Low-cost- costs  less than $0.20 (bill of materials) (traditional centrifuges cost $100-$1000), Electricity free- operates on human power, Paper-based:, Light weight- 2 grams, Easy disposal- dispose of infectious sample and centrifuge by incineration, Print-manufacture, Embedded microfluidics for complex “centrifugal microfluidics” without the need for electricity, High rotational speeds- achieves speeds in excess of 100,000 rpm, High relative centrifugal forces (RCF)- achieves 30,000 g, Can process sample in 2 minutes or less (half the time required by commercial centrifuges to separate plasma from blood), Requires almost no training- can be operated by health workers or patients themselves with minimal user fatigue, Allows integrated paper or polymer based microfluidics, Plastic/injection molded variants, Potential for use in one-step diagnostics that combine sample prep, microfluidics and diagnostics, Can be rapidly deployed for point-of-care diagnostics, Easy to carry; highly robust, waterproof."
Stanford University,"Compact device for low-cost, real-time monitoring of blood coagulation",Docket #: S14-045,"Issued: 9,986,941 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/compact-device-low-cost-real-time-monitoring-blood-coagulation,"Engineers in Prof. James Harris' laboratory have developed a compact optics and microfluidics device to continuously monitor the hemostatic state of patients undergoing heart surgery, dialysis or other procedures. Current techniques that measure hemostatic state (e.g., coagulation and clotting time) rely on highly trained personnel, use bulky and costly instruments, and only provide snapshots of the patient's blood condition at a specific time. To address those shortcomings, this new device employs Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) within a monolithically-integrated arrayable sensing platform to detect fluorescent probes that indicate hemostatic state. The assays do not require any sample prep because they are performed in a microfluidics circuit small enough to attach directly to blood tubes. In addition, the platform could be adapted to operate wirelessly or deliver anti-coagulant drugs as needed. This system could improve patient care by providing portable, low-cost, rapid feedback for early detection of thrombotic events.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have built a prototype VCSEL/detector system and developed molecular-specific probes for several coagulation-related blood markers.\n\nApplications: Patient monitoring - continuous real-time monitoring of blood proteins related to coagulation, with end-user applications such as heart surgery or dialysis, Drug delivery - potential for microfluidic system to be adapted to alter dosage of anti-coagulants or other drugs in response to activity or conditions, such as coronary artery thrombosis.\n\nAdvantages: Compact and inexpensive:, on-chip analysis with small, low-cost VCSEL, photodetector and microfluidic chip instead of bulky optics imaging system, external circuit small enough to attach to standard blood tubes, enables treatment at point-of-care, Real-time monitoring - microfluidic system enables faster analysis than conventional techniques that typically require at least half an hour for sample preparation and processing, Compatible with wireless communication, Streamlined data collection and analysis."

Chemical induction of gene expression is a regulatory tool used in nature to control biological systems.  Methods have been developed to repurpose such a tool to engineer and control synthetic systems in biotechnology.  However, these methods are limited as they can- cause off-target effects, restrict use to specific organisms, have difficulty uncoupling from native cellular regulation, and/or be difficult to integrate into a regulatory platform.

Stanford University,Compact Power And Thruster System for Small Satellites,Docket #: S17-109,"Published Application: 20200378372, Issued: 11,828,273 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/compact-power-and-thruster-system-small-satellites,"Engineers from Stanford and the Australian National University have developed a robust micro electric propulsion system to maneuver miniature satellites (CubeSats) and thereby extend their lifetime. Currently, most small Low Earth Orbit satellites do not have propulsion because they are not large enough for the conventional power electronics needed to drive micro-thrusters. This leaves them vulnerable to atmospheric drag and poor orbit position which limits their lifespan to 6-12 months.\nThis invention solves that problem by integrating the power supply into the structure of the satellite itself. Specifically, the electrical components of a dc to ac RF power converter are embedded inside a printed circuit board (PCB) where an electro-thermal plasma ion micro thruster is mounted. The resulting rigid PCB is mechanically strong enough to serve as a side panel of the satellite, leaving space inside the CubeSat available for propellant or instrument payload.\nThe PCB-integrated thruster can be used for orbital maneuvering and station keeping to extend the lifespan of small satellites such as CubeSats used for as communication, earth imaging and interplanetary mining.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have created a prototype power board (13.8 MHz 14V input 15 W RF power inverter) with PCB inductors and demonstrated its ability to power the miniPR 3.0 inside a vacuum chamber.

The introduction of exogenous DNA sequences into cells plays a major role in a variety of applications ranging from biological discovery to development of new therapeutics.  In many applications it is desirable to have long term expression of the transgene, but in most plasmid DNA vectors the transgene is silenced after its initial high level of expression. Many types of DNA vectors have been generated in recent years in an attempt to overcome this problem, but these vectors all require special bacterial strains or complicated preparation procedures, limiting their practical use.\nBased on their findings that the antibiotic-selectable marker can be optimized to prevent transgene silencing, the inventors have developed an alternative to conventional plasmid vectors. These non-silencing vectors, which use the optimized antibiotic-selectable markers, provide sustained elevated levels of transgene expression and can be produced using simple, well-established methods.\nStage of research\nThe inventors have optimized the kanamycin resistance gene (Kan), a commonly used selectable marker, and shown that using the modified Kan marker transformed a silencing plasmid vector into a non-silencing plasmid vector that provided sustained high levels of transgene expression.

Characterization of genetic information in biological samples requires both accurate quantification and characterization of variants.  Recently, molecular barcodes have been developed to improve gene expression measures, especially for low input amounts and for single cell transcriptome analysis.  However, current barcoding methods either do not scale up well or are prone to sequencing errors that disrupt analysis.  To overcome these limitations, the inventors have developed exponentially-expanded barcodes (EXBs).  EXBs use a computationally designed set of highly error-resistant barcodes followed by a combinatorial enzymatic assembly process to generate high diversity without sacrificing robustness.  This method generates exponentially large numbers of unique, rationally-designed barcodes that can be used to accurately quantify each molecular species present in the sequencing reaction.\nStage of Research\nTo assess the method's performance, the researchers have applied it to known gene expression standards at varying input amounts, and to the analysis of single cells.

Current methods for diagnosing and monitoring allergy patients may be inappropriate for children, require large amounts of sample and/or are expensive.  To overcome these limitations and provide a sensitive, specific, and cost-efficient diagnostic tool the inventors have developed the ISAP (Isotype-Specific Agglutination-PCR) assay.\nISAP is a PCR-based method for detecting antigen-binding antibodies of a specific isotype.  Using only a small amount of sample, the assay can detect the isotype of antibodies against a particular allergen to allow deep investigation of the immunoglobulin response. ISAP can be coupled with other PCR-based methods into a single multiplexed assay to detect total IgE, specific IgE, specific IgG4 and total anti-allergen antibodies providing a comprehensive picture of the immune response.  This technique offers a more sensitive, specific and cost-effective method for better allergy testing in labs and clinics.\nStage of research\nUsing mouse models of peanut allergy, the inventors have shown this method is more sensitive than ELISA-based methods and at least as effective as the gold standard ImmunoCAP platform, while having key advantages including cost-effectiveness and reduced sample consumption.  Optimization of the method for clinical use is ongoing.\n\nApplications: Allergy diagnostic- including peanut allergy, Monitor disease-relevant antibodies associated with autoimmune diseases, infection or inflammation for better disease management.\n\nAdvantages: PCR-based allergy detection assay, Enhanced sensitivity and specificity- more sensitive than ELISA-based methods, Low sample consumption- uses small amount of sample as compared to ImmunoCAP assays, Better for pediatric patients, Low assay cost, Simple work flow, Does not require specialized equipment- uses standard qPCR instruments, Establishes a complete view of the allergic response- allows multiplex detection of diverse allergic information, Compatible with serum or whole blood samples."

Because of the active substrate the inductor is built on, it achieves a much higher quality factor than current inductors, which means that it works significantly better at high frequencies and suffers lower losses from electrical resistance.  This inductor is ideal for providing output voltages to integrated chips, particularly VLSI (very large scale integration) chips, and it reduces power consumption and significantly reduces system size and cost.\nIn demonstration devices inductances of greater than 70 nano-Henries with electrical resistance of less than 1 ohm has been shown for devices under 1 square millimeter in size.

AAV vectors can transduce dividing and non-dividing cells and have been used as vectors for homologous recombination in vitro and in vivo.  However, AAV vectors have a maximum packaging capacity of approximately 4.5kb. With the required homology arms this leaves approximately 3.7kb for a transgene expression cassette, which limits the use of AAV donor vectors in genome editing applications. To overcome this limitation the inventors have developed a method to integrate large transgenes by using two donor AAV vectors. These vectors undergo sequential homologous recombination stimulated by CRISPR/Cas9 to integrate large DNA that exceeds the packing capacity of a single AAV vector. This technology provides an effective solution to enable more widespread use of AAV vectors in genome editing, including in therapeutic applications.\nStage of research\nThis method has been used in primary human T cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to successfully, site-specifically integrate a 5.7kb transgene expression cassette.\nFigure adapted from: Bak, R.

By harnessing “leaky mode resonances” this technology allows thin nanowire rods or beams to absorb many more photons than expected by their size. For scale up, the inventors have developed techniques to replace a planar film with an array of easily-fabricated rods that cover a large area. With this approach, for a given amount of photon absorption, an array structure can be made significantly thinner than a traditional planar structure. This technology opens up tremendous opportunities for the realization of a wide range of high-performance, nanowire-based optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, photodetectors, optical modulators and light sources.\nThe inventors'  research on individual semiconductor nanowire photodetectors (Left and middle panel) has shown how the performance of such detectors can be significantly enhanced by proper design of the size and cross sectional shape. The performance enhancement is derived from the ability of such wires to capture light from a larger area (absorption cross section) than their geometric size (geometric cross section).

Dynamic glass smart windows control solar radiation by switching from transparent to opaque. However, conventional smart window technologies are not commercialized on a large scale due to problems associated with color, cost, durability and switching speed.\nThis invention solves those problems by reversibly electroplating metal over a large area using a durable, invisible metal grid applied to a transparent electrode substrate. The substrate is pre-treated to modify the surface and promote uniform deposition of the opaque metal so that when voltage is applied the substrate converts from transparent to opaque and everything in between within seconds. The glass then maintains either a clear or neutral-colored opaque state without drawing any power.\nThe optically dynamic components of this glass could be deposited on an industrial scale with a solution-based process which is expected to substantially lower costs compared with transition metal oxides. This technology offers a promising alternative to electrochromic materials or transition metal oxides for large-scale smart windows to provide reliable control of solar radiation.\nDynamic Window with Metal Electrodeposition:  Glass reversibly switches from transparent to opaque and back when voltage is applied.\nCross section of metal grid architecture: Uniform opacity switching is achieved using a grid consisting of a metal core conductor (orange), surrounded by an inert metal (gray) which is covered by the electroplating outer layer metal that tints and detints the surface upon application of voltage thereby changing the opacity of the substrate.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have demonstrated the proof-of-principle for opacity switching with gridlines on two 5 cm x 5 cm prototype windows using a modified ITO electrode.

This approach removes false positives from biochemical and bioinformatics artifacts, resulting in unprecedented specificity (no false positives when run on gold standard simulated data) with sensitivity comparable to the best performing published algorithms. Furthermore, the algorithm can analyze short reads and does not require human-guidance for filtering results. MACHETE could potentially pave the way for unbiased de novo discovery of potentially driving and druggable gene fusions in primary tumors with applications in research, diagnostics and drug development.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have benchmarked MACHETE's sensitivity and specificity against the best performing published algorithms.

The ability to control the abundance of a specific protein in cells is a powerful tool for investigating biological behavior and for gene therapy.\nWell-established methods of modulating protein activity involve knocking down the corresponding gene-of-interest.  Among the many challenges of these methods is the inability to directly regulate the protein-of-interest.\nTo overcome these limitations the inventors have developed methods using DDs to directly control the protein level. The DDs are engineered to be unstable in the absence of their stabilizing ligand.  The DD is fused to a gene-of-interest and upon expression the instability is conferred to the fused protein partner resulting in degradation of the entire protein.  The stabilizing ligand can bind to and stabilize the DD thereby restoring function to the protein-of-interest.  This technology provides tools to directly interrogate protein function in living cells and animals and because this DD is derived from an endogenous human protein and is regulated by FDA-approved drugs, this technology holds promise for clinical use in gene therapy.\nStage of research\nDDs based on human proteins have been created and validated.

Microbial electrosynthesis is a process where microbial organisms convert electric current plus carbon dioxide into organic compounds, including chemicals and biofuels.  This process has promising potential for the production of industrially relevant products from carbon dioxide, but increased efficiency would be beneficial for large-scale use.  To help improve the efficiency the inventors took advantage of their finding that the electrosynthesis process could be separated into two coupled steps that use different microbes: microbes that are capable of fast electron uptake from cathodic surfaces and microbes that are effective production platforms for compounds of interest.  Use of the microbial co-culture allows for a highly effective surface-bound electron uptake coupled with efficient surface-independent biosynthesis.  This method enhances the overall electrosynthesis rate and may aide in the development of commercial scale biochemical reactors.\nStage of research\nValidation studies have been completed and show promise.\nRelated technology\nThe Spormann lab has also developed additional microbial electrosynthesis technologies (see Stanford Docket S14-200).\n\nApplications: Microbial electrosynthesis, Biofuel production, Production of carbon dioxide-neutral chemicals.\n\nAdvantages: Increases efficiency of microbial electrosynthesis, Spatial and organism decoupled process- allows for independent engineering and operating two fundamentally different metabolic processes, Strains can be optimized independently to ensure maximum output, Avoids build-up of intermediates, Provides means to produce biofuel without involving biomass or photosynthetic microorganisms."

Light field microscopy is a flexible fast technique for volumetric imaging.  It uses a microlens array to capture spatial and angular distributions of light.    Captured light field images can be processed to reconstruct a full 3D volume.  A limitation with light field microscopy is that the spatial resolution of the reconstructed image can be non-uniform across depth, with some z planes showing high resolution and others, particularly at the center of the imaged volume, showing very low resolution.   To overcome this limitation and enhance the performance of the LFM, the inventors have developed methods using phase masks to improve the spatial resolution.  These methods allow the LFM resolution profile to be much more uniform across depth and improve the resolution around the native object plane.  In addition, the technology provides more flexibility in the LFM's design so that it can be tailored to meet the needs of a specific application.\nStage of research \nA prototype that includes a phase mask has been built and the deconvolution software has been modified to take into account the phase mask.  The approach has been validated using both simulated data and experimental resolution measurements of a USAF 1951 resolution target.

Stanford University,Novel Catheter Based Imaging Probe for Detection of Vulnerable Plaque,Docket #: S15-476,"Published Application: 20170325697, Issued: 10,602,934 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/novel-catheter-based-imaging-probe-detection-vulnerable-plaque,"Researchers at Stanford have developed a dual modality imaging probe to provide improved atherosclerosis detection and evaluation.   Atherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside arteries.  The most common and deadly form is coronary artery diseases (CAD), in which unstable atherosclerotic plaques can rupture leading to substantial morbidity and mortality.  The gold standard for detecting CAD is cardiac catheterization angiography.  However, this technique does not provide information about plaque extent, content, or biology.  It also cannot detect early atherosclerotic plaque.  As such improved methods of detecting atherosclerosis would be highly beneficial. To help meet this need the inventor has developed the CRI-PAT probe, a dual-modality, scintillator catheter probe with the ability to conduct catheter radionuclide imaging (CRI) and photoacoustic tomography (PAT).

Stanford University,Gene set for the diagnosis of active pulmonary tuberculosis,Docket #: S15-057,"Published Application: WO2017066641, Published Application: 20210348233, Issued: 10,920,275 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/gene-set-diagnosis-active-pulmonary-tuberculosis,"Drs. Purvesh Khatri and Timothy Sweeney at Stanford have identified a set of three genes that can be used to diagnose active tuberculosis (TB) and distinguish active TB from latent TB or other diseases.  TB is a worldwide public health problem.  It is hard to accurately diagnose, which leads to difficulties in selecting appropriate treatment.  Traditional diagnostic methods cannot distinguish between latent and active TB and have lower sensitivity in HIV-positive patients; they also rely on adequate production of sputa.  The World Health Organization has thus called for new types of diagnostics that do not rely on sputum, are accurate in children, and are not confounded by HIV co-infection. The set of genes identified by the inventors fulfills these criteria.  In addition, the gene set can distinguish active TB from latent TB and other diseases.  Finally, it can be used to track treatment response as expression of the gene set falls with successful treatment.  This gene set has broad applications for TB diagnosis and treatment response monitoring.\nStage of research\nAs of mid-December 2015 the inventors had extensively validated the gene set in external datasets and demonstrated it is a robust diagnostic for active TB.\n\nApplications: Diagnose TB, Monitor TB treatment response.\n\nAdvantages: Can distinguish active TB from latent TB and other diseases, Blood-based - does not require complex procedures or patient sputum, Can be used to diagnose TB in children, Unaffected by clinical confounders such as HIV status or BCG vaccine status, Small gene set- reduces cost and complexity, Allows for quantitative monitoring of TB treatment response- can identify non-responders earlier, May be used to improve TB drug clinical trials, Can be used as a stand-alone diagnostic or as an adjunct to existing diagnostics."

The genomic region containing KIR is unusually diverse, both in the number of genes and their alleles.  The region is structurally complex and highly polymorphic.  In addition, the genomic region is also strongly associated with a wide spectrum of diseases.  It would be beneficial to understand KIR diversity, but methods to do so are limited by the complexity of the region.\nStanford is making available for licensing the copyrighted list of 4,000 oligonucleotide probes that cover the KIR genes and can be used to enrich KIR regions to prepare DNA libraries for next-gen sequencing.  The bioinformatics pipeline that automatically analyzes KIR specific reads is open-source and will be made freely available – it attributes sequencing reads to specific KIR genes, determines copy number by read depth, and calls high-resolution genotypes for each of the KIR genes.

This core is built around a 2D-stencil processing data-path. 2D stencil based operations are often the most computationally intensive parts of an image processing application. While these operations involve a lot of computation, they are also very regular and thus very efficient hardware implementations are possible. However traditional data-parallel architectures such as GPUs, SIMD units and DSPs are not optimized to fully exploit this regularity. As a result this optimized core can achieve 10-100x lower energy consumption for this class of algorithms compared to GPU/SIMD/DSP solutions. In addition to the 2D-stencil data-path this core includes a wide but light-weight SIMD unit as well as a generalized reduction network to facilitate parts of the computations which are not stencil based.\nA potential application of this is in mobile platforms such as cell phones and tablets which are limited by power / battery life constraints. Smart phone cameras are rapidly replacing traditional P&S cameras as the primary imaging device for consumers. However, the quality of these cameras is severely limited by small form factor of cell phones that prevents the use of better optics and bigger imaging sensors. This technology can be an enabler for advanced computational photography and computer vision techniques for the camera systems in these devices, to help them achieve greater image and video quality. This is of course not the only application area, in fact any power-limited imaging processing system would benefit from this technology. Apart from imaging this can also be generalized for use in any other 2D signal processing application making use of small to moderate size stencil based kernels.\n\nApplications: Image processing applications in embedded imaging systems such as consumer cameras, cell phones, and tablets., Any 2D signal processing application making use of small to moderate size stencil based kernels.\n\nAdvantages: Enable advance image processing capabilities within limited power budget to improve the quality of images and videos produced by cell phones and other embedded image systems."

Brain research is growing rapidly. Simultaneous real-time access to activity signals within specific cell populations and projections will be important for understanding brain function. However, systems to allow such measurement are lacking. To help meet this need the inventors have developed this frame-projected independent-fiber photometry (FIP) microscope that allows users to perform calcium imaging or fluorescence measurement from multiple brain regions simultaneously in the same animal. The microscope allows simultaneous dual-color imaging so multiple genetically-defined neuronal populations can be imaged using calcium indicators with separable emission wavelengths.

The standard approach is currently using single polymerase chain reactions (PCR) one for each amplicon with a single specific primer pair. Several attempts have been made to perform a multiplex PCR where many primer pairs are used simultaneously in one reaction in order to reduce reagent and sample consumption, and thus cost. These attempts have been rather unsuccessful since using many PCR primers in one reaction gives rise to many false amplicons, as well as the desired amplicons. The risk of generating false amplicons increases dramatically upon increasing the number of primer pairs. These false amplicons then limit the utility of the amplification product for purposes such as SNP-detection, gene copy number analyses and sequencing.\nResearchers at Stanford have developed a patented strategy for efficiently removing the false amplicons from the amplification pool while leaving only the correct ones for further amplification or for their direct analysis.\n\nApplications: Sequencing of multiple genes, SNP detection, Gene copy number analyses.\n\nAdvantages: Multiplex PCR currently requires extensive optimization and is rarely performed for more than 10 amplicons at a time.

Different PKC isoforms have been implicated as targets for HIV/AIDS eradication (currently under clinical evaluation) while others figure as targets for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (currently under clinical evaluation) as well as small molecule enhanced cancer immunotherapy, Fragile X syndrome, Niemann-Pick disease, cancers with K-Ras mutation, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease amongst others. Effective small molecule therapies for these diseases could provide real benefits to patients.\nProstratin, originally obtained in scarce and variable amounts from Samoan trees, is a natural product that exhibits potent PKC modulatory activity. Prostratin induces transcriptional activation of latent HIV reservoir cells through the PKC pathway. Activation of such latent cells, leading to their cytopathic or immune mediated death, when used in combination with antiretroviral therapy (ART) represents the most promising strategy to address an as yet unachieved goal, the eradication of HIV.  Prostratin has also shown promise against other diseases. In recent studies, orally administered prostratin has been reported to repress pancreatic tumor growth by disrupting K-Ras-CaM interaction.\nResearchers in Dr. Paul Wender's laboratory at Stanford University have developed an efficient five-step semi-synthesis for prostratin using an abundant, sustainable, and inexpensive source that also provides scalable quantities of superior analogs. This is the only synthetic route to such agents, and the lead analogs are over 130-fold more potent than prostratin itself but show the same PKC selectivity profile and a better therapeutic window as determined in animal studies. The lead analogs show superior activity in all binding, cell, biomarker activation, cell pathway, animal, and humanized animal (BLT mouse) studies and ex vivo studies on samples obtained from volunteers and HIV positive individuals. It is noteworthy that prostratin was discovered as an orally active agent used in traditional medical practices, and indeed orally administered prostratin has been shown to be active against pancreatic tumor. While some PKC modulators such as phorbol esters are known as tumor promoters, prostratin is non-tumorigenic and in fact reverses the tumor-promoting effects of phorbol esters.\nStage of Research\nProstratin had been advanced independently up to and including multiple animal and ADME studies and a positive pre-IND meeting for HIV/AIDS eradication. It has also been evaluated for other indications. The more potent, more accessible and readily tunable analogs made possible by this invention now serve as superior therapeutic leads for development and advancement into clinical trials. The synthesis of prostratin and more potent and effective analogs has been completed as well as the evaluation of the analogs in binding to cell free PKC isoforms, in cell assays including U1 cells and J-Lat cells (with genomically encoded copies of HIV-1), in normal animals and humanized animals (BLT mice) for activation of genomically encoded HIV, and in ex vivo studies of samples from healthy volunteers and HIV positive individuals on suppressive therapy.

This technology describes a patented system to automate the design and interpretation of flow cytometry experiments that use multi-parametric fluorescent markers.  Flow cytometry relies on the measurement of signals from combinations of fluorescence-labeled reagents to indicate the amount of target molecules present in the cell.  Often the fluorescence spectra of the individual dyes overlap and thus it is necessary to use computational methods to resolve the amount of fluorescence detected for each reagent.  Compensation is the mathematical process for correcting multi-parameter flow cytometry data for spectral overlap.  There are data analysis packages that assist with compensation, but there are problems associated with these methods.  To overcome these problems and make the process easier and less error prone, the inventors developed this system.

Stanford University,HCC Cell Line,Docket #: S11-143A,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/hcc-cell-line,"Researchers in Dr. Dean Felsher's lab have generated a murine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line with controllable MYC expression.  HCC is one of the most common and incurable malignancies.  It is strongly associated with hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infection, which leads to the activation of oncogenes including MYC.  MYC is highly involved in tumorigenesis and thus inactivation of MYC may provide an effective therapy for HCC.  To further investigate the role of MYC in HCC the inventors generated this cell line; MYC-induced HCC murine cell line 3-4.  This cell line is derived from LAP-tTA/TRE-MYC transgenic mice, a previously generated transgenic model of MYC-induced HCC using the Tet-system.  With this cell line, doxycycline can be used to suppress MYC expression and thus it provides a useful tool for investigations into MYC regulation.\nStage of research\nThe inventors have used the cell line to investigate the regulation of MYC and its role in HCC.\n\nApplications: Research studies.\n\nAdvantages: MYC expression can be controlled."

These mice highlight their new genetic technique known as Targeted Recombination in Active Populations (TRAP).  The mouse strains express the tamoxifen-dependent recombinase CreER in an activity dependent manner from the endogenous locus of either of the immediate early genes Fos or Arc (FosTRAP or ArcTRAP).   Active cells that express CreER undergo recombination when tamoxifen is present, whereas inactive cells do not.  When genetically encoded effectors for visualizing and manipulating neurons are also used in these mice it is possible to obtain permanent genetic access to distributed neuronal populations that are activated by experiences within a limited time window.  These mice will facilitate experimental dissection of neural circuit function.\n(A) Experimental scheme: FosTRAP mice had either all whiskers except C2 plucked unilaterally or had only the C2 whisker plucked.

Stanford University,A live-cell sensor for cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity,Docket #: S13-392,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/live-cell-sensor-cyclin-dependent-kinase-2-activity,"Scientists in Dr. Tobias Meyer's lab at Stanford have developed a live-cell fluorescent sensor for cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity.  Cellular transitions from proliferation to quiescence and quiescence to proliferation are important both during development and for normal adult physiology.   Proliferation is characterized by progression through the cell cycle, which is driven by CDK activity.  The cell cycle is typically studied in synchronized cells using biochemical approaches, which has several drawbacks including loss of single cell information and the potential for synchronization procedures to trigger stress responses in cells.  To overcome these limitations, the inventors have developed the first live-cell sensor for CDK2 activity.  Because CDK2 activity is tightly coupled to progression through the cell cycle, the sensor also detects whether cells are in a proliferative or quiescent state.\nStage of research\nUsing in vitro kinase assays and specific inhibitors, the inventors confirmed the sensor responds rapidly and specifically to CDK2 activity.  In addition, using time-lapse microscopy and customized cell tracking they showed the senor has a dynamic range well-suited to monitor changes in CDK2 activity throughout the cell cycle.\n\nApplications: Drug screening- identify compounds that:, Promote proliferation (for regenerative medicine), Promote quiescence (for cancer therapy), Research, Cell cycle studies, Determine if cells are in a proliferative or quiescent state.\n\nAdvantages: Only live-cell CDK2 activity sensor, Monitor CDK2 activity instantaneously in real-time, Genetically encoded and can be transduced into any cell type using a virus, Uses only 1 fluorescent channel, High signal-to-noise ratio, Provides molecular timer for progression through interphase, Can determine a cell's commitment to the cell cycle without need to perturb it or monitor its future behavior.."

These side effects are poorly tolerated in all surgical patients without human intervention, but especially in very young children who possess immature physiologic compensatory mechanisms, as well as in the elderly with confounding comorbidities and otherwise exhausted compensatory mechanisms.  In light of this, Stanford investigators, Edward Bertaccini, MD and Frances Davies, PhD, have pursued the development of new lead compounds to produce the next generation of safer anesthetic agents, especially for the very young and very old who now utilize an ever increasing share of healthcare dollars.  Their methodologies of in silico screening and prediction of compounds which bind to a validated model of the gamma amino butyric acid receptor (GABAR) have now identified a class of lead compounds which demonstrate overt anesthetic activity in animals.  Preliminary electrophysiology analyses are consistent with a GABAR mechanism. These compounds are derived from novel chemical structures not previously associated with or known to produce significant anesthetic effects.  The investigators are refining these lead compounds with additional sophisticated in silico molecular modeling, in vitro ion channel and brain slice electrophysiology, as well as extended behavioral and physiologic analyses in mammals so as to design the next generation of safer anesthetic agents.\n\nApplications: In anesthesiology, for use in the spectrum of consciousness modulation from light sedation to general anesthesia., In other procedural settings not involving anesthesiologists but which require various amounts of sedation..\n\nAdvantages: New chemical scaffold never before known to possess general anesthetic potency., Readily amenable to chemical modification., Core structures readily available in larger quantities.."

Stanford University,Modification of PET Blood Collection Tubes,Docket #: S13-189,"Published Application: WO2015069662, Issued: 10,259,922 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/modification-pet-blood-collection-tubes,"Dr. Richard Zare and colleagues have developed an inexpensive, fast and simple method for treating polyethylene terephthalate (PET) blood collection tubes (BCTs) to remove bias and interference in various blood analysis procedures.  Blood collection and processing are two major steps in pre-analytical laboratory testing.  Traditionally, glass was the preferred material for making BCTs.  However, due to danger from broken glass, BCTs are now made of plastic, specifically PET.  The PET polymer surface is hydrophobic and not optimal for blood analysis as cells and analytes are adsorbed on the plastic surface. To overcome this limitation, tube manufacturers add a surfactant coating to the tube to make the inner surface hydrophilic.  This approach has its own problems as the surfactant additives can interfere with blood analysis.

Stanford University,PocketFEATURE: Using Multiple Microenvironments to Find Similar Ligand-Binding Sites,Docket #: S14-071,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/pocketfeature-using-multiple-microenvironments-find-similar-ligand-binding-sites,"Small molecule drugs may interact with many proteins.  Some of these interactions may cause unexpected effects, including side effects or potentially useful therapeutic effects.   One way to predict these effects is to analyze the three-dimensional structure of target proteins, and identify new binding sites for small molecule drugs.  Several methods have been proposed for predicting new binding sites, relying on geometric and functional complementarity of the sites and the small molecules.\nStanford researchers have come up with an algorithm that seeks similar microenvironments within two binding sites, and assesses overall binding site similarity by the presence of multiple shared micro environments. PocketFEATURE is a new method for identifying novel protein-drug interactions.  It seeks similar microenvironments within two binding sites, and assesses overall binding site similarity by the presence of multiple shared microenvironments.  The method has relatively weak geometric requirements (to allow for conformational change or dynamics in both the ligand and the pocket) and uses multiple biophysical and biochemical measures to characterize the microenvironments (to allow for diverse modes of ligand binding).  It has proved that geometric flexibility is useful for effectively comparing sites.\n\nApplications: The method can be applied to compare drug-binding sites.  The recognition of cryptic drug-binding sites in protein structures is important for understanding off-target side effects and for recognizing potential new indications for existing drugs..\n\nAdvantages: PocketFEATURE can better discriminate sites that bind similar ligands from those that do not.

Stanford University,DNA Repair Compounds to Prevent Cancer,Docket #: S10-253,"Published Application: WO2014164730, Published Application: 20160038444, Issued: 10,188,617 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/dna-repair-compounds-prevent-cancer,"Stanford researchers have identified small molecules that can intercept cancerous or pre-cancerous cells by activating DNA repair in cells damaged by oxidative stress. These compounds could be used as chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agents to prevent malignancy or metastasis in patients with impaired DNA base-excision repair (BER) due to BRCA1 mutations or other factors. This approach may prove more effective than current chemoprevention agents because BRCA1-associated cancers rarely express the estrogen receptor (the target for tamoxifen or raloxifene). Because the BER-activating compounds have been approved for use in humans for other indications, they have a known safety profile and are candidates for drug repositioning.\nBRCA1- mediated Tumorigenesis and Prevention. Oxidative DNA damage (ODD) is induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and removed by the base-excision DNA repair pathway (BER). ODD, if left unrepaired, leads to mutagenesis, genetic instability, and tumorigenesis. BRCA1 activates BER, reduces levels of ODD, and thus, has been implicated in preventing tumorigenic events. When BRCA1 is mutated, DNA repair-activating drugs may enhance BER and prevent tumorigenesis.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have demonstrated direct BER activation with benserazide and acetohexamide in the presence of mutant BRCA1 in vitro. In further studies, benserazide was superior to tamoxifen in preventing in vitro tumorigenesis of BRCA1-mutated cells and it delayed in vivo tumorigenesis of BRCA1-mutant breast cancer cells.\n\nApplications: Chemoprevention - prophylactic treatment for patients with a predisposition for cancer due to oxidative DNA damage (e.g. patients with BRCA mutations), Cancer therapeutic - prevent or delay metastasis by activating DNA repair, Drug repositioning - small molecule drugs with DNA repair activity (such as bensearzide or acetohexamide) could be developed for cancer indications.\n\nAdvantages: Known safety profile for existing compounds found to have DNA repair activity, Specificity for BRCA1-associated malignancies compared to current chemoprevention agents which target the estrogen receptor, Chemoprevention approach reduces need for prophylactic surgery."

Stanford University,Transgenic Mice Carrying a Reporter Gene for the Hedgehog Signaling Pathway,Docket #: S97-107,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/transgenic-mice-carrying-reporter-gene-hedgehog-signaling-pathway,"The patched gene is a component of the so-called Hedgehog signaling pathway that is known to be involved in the commonest human cancer, basal cell carcinoma, and in brain cancer.  In this pathway, a secreted signaling protein called Hedgehog binds to a receptor called Patched on receiving cells.  Patched is employed in many events in normal development including formation of the neurons that are depleted in Parkinson's disease, formation of normal limbs and musculature, signaling in gut development, chondrogenesis, and proper development of the brain.  When Hedgehog binds to its receptor, the transcription of “target” genes is induced.  Target genes include powerful Wnt and TGFß regulators of development and cell growth, and are the output from the Hedgehog pathway.  One of the genes whose transcription is induced is patched itself, the receptor gene, perhaps to soak up excess Hedgehog and limit the duration of the signaling.  Whatever the reason, high-level transcription of patched is an indicator of the receipt of Hedgehog signal in every tissue that has been checked in humans, mice, chickens, fish and files.  Therefore having a way to readily detect patched transcription in various cell types provides a powerful assay for Hedgehog signaling.\nTransgenic mice were constructed containing an E. coli lacZ gene inserted into the patched gene.  Homozygous embryos are normal, so the insertion did little or no damage to the gene.  The homozygotes have also been determined to be fully viable.  The exact structure of the gene carrying the insertion is not known, but the insert clearly interrupts the gene internally.  ßgalactosidase produced under the control of the inserted gene is found in most or all of the places the patched gene is normally transcribed.  Thus the lacZ gene is properly regulated by control elements that flank the patched gene.  To our knowledge, no other mice have been constructed with any of these properties\nApplications of these mice include establishing standard in vivo and in vitro assays for Hedgehog activity, creating cell lines from a variety of differentiating tissues and testing response to Hedgehog, and screening chemical and biological substances for their activity as agonists or antagonists of the pathway.\n\nApplications: Applications of these mice include establishing standard in vivo and in vitro assays for Hedgehog activity, creating cell lines from a variety of differentiating tissues and testing response to Hedgehog, and screening chemical and biological substances for their activity as agonists or antagonists of the pathway.."

BK channels are prominent regulators of excitability in neurons, smooth muscle and neuroendocrine tissues. Loss of BK channel function disrupts many physiological processes and can cause cerebellar ataxia, tremor, urinary incontinence, disruption of circadian rhythms, bradycardia, hypertension, hyperaldosteronism, impaired neurovascular coupling, erectile dysfunction, impaired hearing, impaired glucose homeostasis, impaired neuro- and cardio-protection, and altered learning and memory.  Recently, a new neuromuscular channelopathy was identified, stemming from mutations in KCNMA1 causing BK channel dysfunction (OMIM # 600150).  KCNMA1 patient mutations are primarily associated with neurological conditions, including seizures, movement disorders, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. KCNMA1?/?

This method employs cell/particle cavities created in a polymeric film (imprinted polymeric film, IPF). When incorporated into microfluidic chips, the IPFs chemically recognize particles or cells of interest in a sample and selectively re-adsorb them within minutes. Unlike FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting), the IPF-based technology can sort multiple cells simultaneously and does not require fluorescent labels. This method is well-suited for recognizing bacterial cells or other particles that are too large for chromatography. This technique could be applied to cell sorting from any fluid sample (such as water, blood, urine or plasma) for research or diagnostics.\nSchematic (left) and confocal microscopy image (right) of cell imprints on a polymer surface.

A longstanding goal of neuroscience has been the accurate optical reporting of electrical activity in genetically defined neuronal populations.  Fluorescent voltage sensors offer a promising approach to this as they allow a set of neurons in a region to be genetically defined and simultaneously visualized without the need for chemical access.  However, existing sensors have limitations such as slow kinetics and suboptimal fluorescence responses that hinder their ability to accurately sense the range of neuronal activity.

However, most conventional hydrogels lack the macroporosity desirable for efficient cell proliferation and migration, and have limited flexibility when subject to mechanical load. Microfiber-based scaffolds, on the other hand, are inherently macroporous and flexible, but are often associated with cell-unfriendly fabrication procedures which make microfibers unsuitable for direct cell-encapsulation.\nTo overcome these limitations, Stanford researchers have created a novel scaffold material consisting of crosslinkable, microribbon-like elastomers, which can assemble into highly macroporous scaffolds that facilitate cell encapsulation and support cell proliferation in 3D.\nThe biochemical composition, macroporosity level, and mechanical properties of the microribbon-based scaffolds can be independently adjusted to influence cell behaviors associated with biochemical, topographical and mechanical cues. Furthermore, the geometry of microribbons enables the microribbon-based scaffolds to sustain large deformation and mechanical stress.\nIn published results, the researchers showed that, when encapsulated in the microribbon-based scaffold, human adipose derived stromal cells proliferated up to 30-fold within 3 weeks. Furthermore, microribbon-based scaffolds demonstrate great flexibility and can sustain up to 90% strain and 3 MPa stress without failing.

Stanford University,PCAmask: a novel approach for elucidating the evolutionary history of human populations through local ancestry deconvolution in admixed individuals,Docket #: S13-268,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/pcamask-novel-approach-elucidating-evolutionary-history-human-populations-through-local,"The genomes of admixed individuals are unique in that they are comprised of a mosaic of DNA segments derived from different ancestral populations. The advent of local ancestry deconvolution algorithms--designed to assign specific regions of admixed chromosomes to their respective ancestral origin--has made it possible to explore the genetic structure of ancient populations through the lens of modern admixed genomes.\nWhile a number of algorithms have been developed to tackle the local ancestry problem, few tools have been devised to make meaningful use of the resulting information in the context of human evolutionary biology.  Furthermore, this approach has suffered from a lack of resolution, providing information on continental variations in ancestry (e.g. whether a genome derives more of its ancestry from European versus African ancestors), but with limited insights into finer scale variation (e.g. whether a European segment may have corresponded to an Italian vs. a Scandinavian ancestor).\nStanford researchers have discovered an approach that provides a rigorous statistical framework for a more refined analysis of the genetics of ancestral populations. Specifically, the method interfaces three novel algorithms, acting in the following capacities:\n1.  A local ancestry deconvolution algorithm (RFMix, S13-178) is run to classify different regions of the admixed genomes by continental ancestry.\n2.  A PCA-based classification method (PCAmask) is used to further resolve the ancestral origins of the ancestral blocks identified in the first step, by projecting specific ancestral blocks against diverse panels of human populations deriving from that ancestral continental group.\n3.  A novel demographic inference algorithm (Tracts) is used to identify demographic events that are likely to have shaped variation in the ancestral populations that gave rise to the admixed population under study.\n\nApplications: Can be used to make inferences on the natural history of human populations, Can be used to identify ancestry-specific health risk factors in specific populations, Can readily be used to empower current admixture mapping and association studies.\n\nAdvantages: Integration of local ancestry deconvolution with downstream genetic clustering and demographic inference approaches in a single, seamless framework, Increased resolution into the genetic structure of components of admixture in admixed populations versus other methods, such as running PCA or ADMIXTURE on non-deconvolved genomes."

Stanford University,Super Resolution for Light Field Microscopy,Docket #: S13-113,"Published Application: 2014-263963, Issued: 9,658,443 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/super-resolution-light-field-microscopy,"Light field microscopy (LFM) is a new technique for high-speed volumetric imaging of weakly scattering or fluorescent specimens. It employs an array of microlenses to trade off spatial resolution against angular resolution, thereby yielding the information needed to reconstruct a volume from a single photographic exposure.  However, this ability to perform scan-less 3-D imaging comes at a cost: the resulting volume reconstruction has considerably lower lateral resolution than a conventional microscope image.\nThis invention addresses this drawback of conventional light field microscopy.  This technique, which draws its inspiration from“super-resolution” methods in computer vision, enables reconstructions of up to 8x higher resolution than previously possible with conventional LFM when reconstructing a planar object, and up to 2-4x higher resolution when reconstructing a sample with complex 3-D structure.  This resolution improvement is due in part to a new, more accurate optical model based on wave optics that captures the effects of diffraction in light field microscope images.  The GPU accelerated reconstruction algorithm in this implementation also performs 3-D deconvolution, which enhances lateral resolution while also computationally removing out-of-focus light in the volume for better optical sectioning.\nComparison of conventional (a) and LFM (b and c) imaging of USAF 1951 resolution test target translated to depths up to 100 um from the native object plane (z = 0 um). The wave optics reconstruction algorithm (c) improves lateral resolution up to 8-fold compared to standard LFM imaging (b), except at the z = 0 plane (left image).\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have validated this technology by measuring lateral resolution on a standard USAF 1951 resolution target.  They have demonstrating the ability to resolve higher spatial frequencies in the images reconstructed with the new algorithm with the target placed at a range of different z-depths spanning a range of +/- 200 microns.  The technique has been shown to work well with a variety of different microscope objectives.  They have also reconstructed images of pollen grain to demonstrate the improved image resolution and optical sectioning capability of a biological specimen.\n\nApplications: Microscopy - Light Field Microscopy for fast 3-D recording of dynamic phenomenon with end user applications in:\n\nbiological research\nclinical pathology\nquality assurance inspections, biological research, clinical pathology, quality assurance inspections.\n\nAdvantages: High resolution 3-D imaging - 8-fold improved lateral resolution and better optical sectioning compared to standard LFM, Improved Optical Model - the newly developed wave optics model is considerably more accurate when modeling the imaging process at microscopic scales where diffraction plays a key role.."

Unwanted small differences in the hydrostatic pressure in reservoirs result in unwanted pressure-driven flows in the channels, and these flows may disturb on-chip processes including chemical and biological separations and analysis.  This method controls flow in a microfluidic system by adding a phase-change material at the interface between the local atmosphere and the fluid in a channel. The method does not change the hydrostatic or ionic resistance in the channel, so it does not influence separations and analysis occurring in the channel.  The method is also compatible with electrode reactions at the sealed reservoir.\n\nApplications: Microfluidic devices.\n\nAdvantages: Conditions within channels of a microfluidic system are not changed by the presence of the phase change material, and this ensures that separations and/or analyses are unaffected by this approach for preventing pressure driven fluid flow., Allows the material introduced to quickly take the shape of the input/output node region prior to phase change., Versatile and can accommodate a wide variety of sizes and shapes of input/output nodes., Enables rapid and conformal sealing of input/output nodes, including reservoirs integrated with electrodes., Process can be reversible.."

This novel algorithm has two major innovations.  Firstly, it utilizes an intervention on the Kalman filter observation noise to re-weight certain neural observations.  When the neural observations are, for example, low-dimensional neural trajectories as found via principal component analysis, the intervention can be used to ameliorate directional biases in the decoder by deweighting principal components that have less information about the directional control of the prosthetic device.  Secondly, the algorithm may utilize prior information on the dimensionality of the space in which the neural data is projected into.  For example, if the space was better sampled when more neurons were previously observed, that space can be remembered; then, in experiments where far fewer neurons are observed, these neurons can be noisily projected into the remembered space.\n\nApplications: This algorithm serves to increase the performance of poorly performing BMIs..\n\nAdvantages: This algorithm can """"save"""" poorly performing BMIs, increasing their performance to higher levels.."

Stanford University,Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors Used in the Slow Light Mode for Ultra-High Sensitivity Sensing,Docket #: S09-099,"Published Application: 20150330848, Issued: 9,019,482 (USA), Issued: 9,329,089 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/fiber-bragg-grating-sensors-used-slow-light-mode-ultra-high-sensitivity-sensing,"Light with a narrowband spectrum is launched into the FBG, at a wavelength located on one of the two edges of the reflection peak of the FBG, i.e., at a wavelength where the FBG transmits, rather than reflects, light. The frequency of the light is selected to be on the edge of the bandgap of the FBG. The reason for this choice is that on the edge of the bandgap, light experiences a significant group delay, i.e., it travels with a much slower group velocity than the normal group velocity of light in the fiber in which the grating is made. This effect,the existence of slow light on the edges of the bandgap of a fiber grating‹has been known for quite some time. It has been investigated, in particular, to evaluate the potential use of an FBG for dispersion compensation, for example in optical communication systems. A second benefit of this mode of operation is that at this wavelength (and in its immediate vicinity), the power transmission of the FBG is very close to unity, and consequently the loss experienced by the signal as it propagates through the FBG is small. A third benefit is that at this wavelength, the impact of a perturbation (e.g., a strain) applied to the FBG on light traveling through the FBG is that is modifies the phase of the light, not its amplitude. To be more exact, it modifies to first order the phase, and to second order the amplitude. This is in contrast to the reflection mode of an FBG, in which the FBG modifies the frequency of the light that it maximally reflected. Consequently, in the transmission mode, the FBG can be used as any phase sensor, i.e., it can be placed directly in one of any number of interferometer to convert the phase modulation induced by the measurand into a power change (which is the quantity the user measures). This instrument can be, for example, a nominally balanced MZ interferometer. In contrast, in the reflection mode, as described in the prior art section, one needs an instrument that converts a wavelength (or frequency) change into a power change, which requires an imbalanced interferometer (when high precision is required). As hinted above, the use of a balanced MZ instead of an imbalanced MZ results in a great improvement in the temperature stability of the MZ interferometer, and therefore of its phase bias, which simplifies engineering considerably.\nThis patent is available for licensing through Stanford's exclusive licensee.\nPlease contact Dennis Fortner at: Dennis.Fortner@ngc.com for licensing information.\n\nApplications: The invention is used as strain/temperature sensor with ultra high sensitivity..\n\nAdvantages: The benefits of using FBG as a sensor in transmission mode are a greatly increased sensitivity to a measurand (example, a strain), a significant reduction in the required length of the FBG, and the elimination of the need to use an imbalanced MZ as a measurement tool: the MZ can be perfectly balanced.."

These methods represent a useful tool to diagnose preleukemia, prognose disease progression and monitor therapeutic success of the chosen cancer treatment. This disclosure also includes methods to identify leukemia stem cells, which are involved in disease progression and development of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Unlike typical hematopoietic progenitor cells, leukemia stem cells have activated the beta-catenin pathway and, as a result, behave like hematopoietic stem cells, in that they acquire the capacity to self-renew and, thus, to facilitate the long-term proliferation of the cancer. The proliferation of leukemia stem cells can be blocked by inhibitors of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. This process can be monitored both in vitro using replating assays and in vivo using bioluminescent imaging of transplanted leukemia stem cell populations in a highly immunocompromised mouse model.  It is critical to determine the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic agent or regimen in eliminating these self-renewing leukemia stem cells by monitoring the proliferation and self-renewal of leukemia stem cells.  The technology described may have broader applications in the detection and elimination of cancer stem cells in other malignancies that have activated the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway such as colon, hepatocellular and breast cancer.\n\nApplications: Progenitor profiling can be used diagnostically to detect pre-leukemia as well as minimal residual disease, Progenitor profiling allows clinical staging of leukemia, Identification of leukemia stem cells via analysis of beta-catenin activation serves as a diagnostic tool to monitor and predict disease progression, relapse and development of drug resistance, In vitro replating assays as well as in vivo engraftment studies via bioluminescent imaging of transplanted cells in a highly immunocompromised mouse model may be used as screening tools to detect factors and molecules that are active on cancer stem cells as well as normal hematopoietic stem cells, Wnt/beta signaling pathway inhibitors can be used to inhibit leukemia stem cell self-renewal and proliferation but may be more broadly applicable in the elimination of other cancer stem cells.\n\nAdvantages: Diagnostic and prognostic information, Rapid pre-clinical assessment of cancer stem cell phenotype, Rapid pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo screening of response of cancer stem cell populations to specific molecularly targeted inhibitors, Wnt/beta-catenin pathway inhibitors represent novel agents for cancer stem cell inhibition that are effective even in the setting of resistance to other molecularly targeted therapies."

This technique is used to generate truly monodisperse, highly repetitive polypeptides that can be used, for instance, as DNA “drag-tags” in Free-Solution Conjugate Electrophoresis (“FSCE”). These large, protein-based polymers enable significantly longer sequencing reads than the smaller drag-tags to which the technology was previously restricted by purity problems. This technology is particularly applicable for DNA separations on microfluidic platforms because it facilitates exon-length sequencing in an aqueous solution, without the need for a viscous sieving matrix.\nThe general clone construction/protein design and accompanying purification protocols can be used for generating protein-based polymers for pharmaceutical, biomaterials, or other research applications where precise characterization and true monodispersity of a protein modifier is important.\nThis schematic of FSCE shows the monodisperse protein drag-tag (blue) conjugated to the DNA sequencing fragment (red) with fluorescent dye attached for detection (yellow star).  Covalent attachment of the drag-tag to the DNA molecule allows for size-based separation in an electric field with no sieving matrix.\nStage of Research\nThe inventors have purified drag-tags as long as ~ 500 amino acids. They used a 267-amino acid drag tag in FSCE to read 265 bases of DNA by capillary electrophoresis in 30 minutes, with no sieving matrix.\n\nApplications: DNA sequencing and separation - generating monodisperse drag-tags for FSCE-based DNA separation, sequencing, and genotyping technologies, Microfluidics - drag-tags enable DNA separation and sequencing in an aqueous solution (without a viscous sieving matrix), which is ideal for implementation on microfluidic devices, Biomaterials research - these clone/protein designs and purification methods could be used to generate other protein polymers for applications in which precise characterization and true monodispersity is important (e.g., any FDA-regulated product).\n\nAdvantages: Pure protein polymers - FSCE is a highly sensitive analytical method that provides high resolution and can thus determine the true monodispersity of a protein polymer sample, Longer sequencing reads - larger protein polymer drag-tags have the potential to achieve single-base resolution sequencing of up to 400 contiguous DNA bases (compared to previous, smaller drag-tags that gave read lengths of ~180 bases or less), Advantages of FSCE - less time, lower reagent cost, and simpler preparation than matrix-based separation, particularly in microfluidic chips."

Furthermore, it provides a useful tool to monitor immune responses after therapies or exposures that alter the immune system or in other patients who have diseases related to the immune system.  More specifically, this new technology determines the clonality of immune cell populations by assessing the diversity of immune receptor loci.  Unlike healthy immune systems, malignancies originating from B- or T-cells typically express a single dominant clonal immunoglobulin or T cell receptor.  While surrogate measures for clonality can be obtained using capillary electrophoresis, such methods lack sensitivity and specificity.

In more detail, the target protein is analyzed using two so called proximity probes each with a target specific binding moiety (such as an antibody) and a reactive DNA oligonucleotide component. Upon the addition of a pair of asymmetric nucleic acid connectors, two proximity probes which are close to each other will hybridize to  the same connector forming the ligation substrate and the assay signal.

A typical minicircle contains a transgene expression cassette, and is free of all other plasmid DNA elements, including an antibiotic resistance gene and a plasmid DNA replication origin.  This reduces the potential for silencing and inflammatory effects associated with these sequences.\nThe minicircle produced with this method provides a stable and persistent expression of the transgene expression cassette in quiescent cells and tissues, and reduces CpG inflammatory responses observed in some plasmid transfection schemes.\nThis invention improves the production of minicircle DNA by making a versatile bacterial strain. This bacterium is genetically engineered to express (1) multiple copies of an inducible phiC31 gene, the recombinase which mediates the formation of a  minicircle expression cassette from the parental plasmid; (2) multiple copies of an inducible ISce1 gene, the restriction enzyme,  which when expressed destroys the unwanted plasmid bacterial backbone DNA, and (3) two different genes encoding transporters of L-arabinose, which is the inducer of the araC.BAD system controlling the expression of both the recombinase phiC31 and the  restriction enzyme ISce1.\nConsequently, the new system has the following advantages:\n(1) Reduces contamination of parental plasmid and its derivatives from 5 -15% to 1%.\n(2) Reduces the time of minicircle preparation to that of routine plasmid preparations\n(3) Reduces the amount of arabinose required by over 100-fold.\n(4) Reduces the  risk of phiC31/ISceI genes by removing them from the parental plasmid to the  bacterial genome making the final process GMP compatible.\n\nApplications: To produce more effective and pure minicircle DNA vectors than current methods for therapeutic (including gene therapy) in vitro and in vivo use, diagnostic, prophylactic or research applications..\n\nAdvantages: The previous method of minicircle production gives 5 to 15% contamination with the parental plasmid.

The DM also involves multi-threaded execution, allowing interruption of the interpretation and processing of a dialogue contribution, enabling speakers to interrupt each other as appropriate.\nThe DM is built using an open software architecture and is reconfigurable to different domains without requiring re-coding of core infrastructure, although all core processes may be easily extended or enhanced to address domain- or application-specific issues, without changing the core code-base.  The DM has been built to work with different parsers, speech-recognizers, language-generation, speech-synthesis components, structured knowledge-bases, and devices, without modification behind well-defined APIs (interfaces).\n\nApplications: Cell phones, Computers.\n\nAdvantages: Supports natural interaction, Can involve multiple devices and/or humans, Allows interruption of interpretation, Reconfigurable to different domains without requiring re-coding of core infrastructure, Built to work with different parsers, speech-recognizers, language-generation, speech-synthesis components, structured knowledge-bases, and devices without modification behind well-defined APIs (interfaces)."

Stanford University,Delayed Decision Feedback Sequence Estimator,Docket #: S09-168,"Published Application: 20090268804, Issued: 8,116,366 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/delayed-decision-feedback-sequence-estimator,"In high-speed serial links, most receivers use decision feedback equalization to deal with channel loss.  While this corrects for the effect of channel dispersion, it does not take into account the dispersed energy in making the decision about each bit.  To do that requires a soft-decision Viterbi decoder.  Unfortunately these get very complex when the energy is spread over many samples.  Since most of the energy is concentrated in a few bits, one would like to use a Viterbi decoder, combine with a DFE to cancel out the remaining bits.  These systems have been proposed, but currently must be run at the bit rate, which is not possible in very high-speed links.  Stanford engineers have broken through this bottleneck, and created a delayed decision feedback sequence estimator (DDFSE) that operates at a clock rate of 1/M of that of the received data and can decode the data in parallel.  The key is removing errors that can be introduced by partitioning the data into chunks.\n\nApplications: High speed communications, High-performance communications.\n\nAdvantages: Accelerated parallel processing, Improved error detection."

Stanford University,Method for Dispersing Light Using Multilayered Structures,Docket #: S99-127,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/method-dispersing-light-using-multilayered-structures,"Stanford researchers have invented a novel method and device for separating light of differing wavelengths.  This method uses a very simple and compact multilayer dielectric structure having high angular dispersion at certain wavelengths and angles of incidence.  The structure is composed of alternating layers of dielectric materials of different refractive indices, and is designed to operate just outside the main reflection.  In this region, there is strong group velocity dispersion, causing different wavelength of light to travel at different angles through the dielectric stack.  As a consequence, different wavelength components of a polychromatic beam are separated as they pass through the device.  This device can also operate as a multiplexer by simply reversing the direction of the light.\n\nApplications: Optical communications, Optical wavelength multiplexing and de-multiplexing, WDM - spatially separating and/or combining component wavelength beams in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical communication.\n\nAdvantages: The device can operate with light entering and/or exiting the substrate, The device comprises of anti-reflective and reflective coatings to attain high optical efficiency and to increase spatial separation of the wavelengths of light, The device can also operate as a multiplexer, The device is very compact, inexpensive to fabricate, and made from readily available materials."

The key concept for this laser-driven undulator is its ability to provide phase synchronicity between the deflection force from the laser and the electron beam for a distance that is much greater than the laser wavelength. Because of the possibility of high-peak electric fields from ultrashort pulse lasers on dielectric materials, the proposed undulator is expected to produce phase-synchronous GV/m deflection fields on a relativistic electron bunch and therefore lead to a very compact free electron-based radiation device. End user applications include particle accelerators, security scanners, and X-rays for medical imaging.\nFigure\nImage credit - Physical Review Special Topics-Accelerators and Beams, Vol. 11, Issue 3, March 20, 2008.\nFigure Description- (a) Perspective view of a section of the proposed deflection structure element.

This invention utilizes the Shield-1 technology (see Stanford Docket S06-024) to control the stability, and therefore the function, of proteins expressed from transgenes in vivo.  The system allows therapeutic applications of genes that could not otherwise be used (e.g. too toxic, external regulation of gene function necessary).\nThis approach is ideally suited for gene therapy because it can be switched on and off, it can be applied to any protein, and it only requires a small amount of DNA to be incorporated into the vector.  In addition, it could be applied to a variety of biological therapies.  Initial studies in mouse models have shown excellent dose control, have reduced tumor burden when a therapeutic transgene product is stabilized within a tumor, and have demonstrated control over viral vector transgene product.\nStage of Research\nIn vivo studies have reduced tumor burden in mouse models of cancer with excellent dose control of the conditional stability of an immunomodulatory cytokine expressed from an oncolytic virus.  The inventors have also applied the system to regulate the stability of over 30 proteins in cultured cells or in vivo.\nOngoing Research\nAdditional studies are presently underway involving the development and characterization of a second system for regulating protein stability using a different ligand.  This new technology will allow the simultaneous regulation of two proteins or small groups of protein in cultured cells or in living animals.

Stanford University,Proxy Identity Based Encryption,Docket #: S06-321,Published Application: 20080170701,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/proxy-identity-based-encryption,"Proxy Identity Based Encryption (proxy IBE) is a new encryption scheme that allows a user to send data encrypted with any given public key to a receiving user who decrypts the data with their own private key which is of no relation to the key used for encryption. This is possible through the use of a proxy server that translates a message encoded in one key set into an encrypted form that can be decrypted by another key set. This means that Alice can encrypt data using her public key (or anyone else can use Alice's public key for encryption), but Bob can then decrypt the data using his unrelated private key once the proxy re-encrypts the message. Alice can encrypt all her data and messages with the same key, if she desires, and share them without having to share her secret key. To do this, Alice generates and gives a re-encryption key for her public key to the proxy; the proxy then re-encrypts messages using this re-encryption key so that the message can be decrypted using Bob's secret key. This means that Alice must grant permission for Bob to access the message or data in order for the proxy server to re-encrypt the data into a form that Bob can decrypt. The proxy server cannot decrypt the message because it does not have Bob's private key, so Bob is the only user capable of decrypting the data- yet he cannot do that without the translation task performed by the proxy.\n\nApplications: Networked storage. Alice can store data encrypted with her public key. If Bob wishes to access her data, she can give permission and the proxy can access her data, then transform it into the encrypted form that Bob can decode using his private key. Yet the proxy server can't decode her data, so she doesn't need to trust the proxy as much as with a normal public key system where Alice would need to give out her private key, Law enforcement and government agencies can use the networked storage setup to provide secure databases, Secure e-mail forwarding can be accomplished through these systems, Outsourced spam filtering in a secure system can be accomplished through proxy IBE (identity based encryption).\n\nAdvantages: No certificate management, Optimal secret key size (no additional secret keys necessary), Optimal encoded message size (the re-encrypted message is as large as the original message), No additional algorithms or processes are necessary for the decryption of the re-encrypted message."
Stanford University,Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2*2 (ALDH2*2) knock-in gene targeting mice-an experimental model for a prevalent human genetic disorder in East Asians,Docket #: S08-154,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/mitochondrial-aldehyde-dehydrogenase-22-aldh22-knock-gene-targeting-mice-experimental,"A common dominant negative allele, Aldh2*2, exists in the human population. The ALDH2*2 mutant retains only about 1-3% of the enzymatic activity of a corresponding wild-type ALDH2 and affects >40% of the East Asian population (including Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese and Koreans with an estimated > 1 billion affected individuals). Reduced ALDH2 activity has been associated with a range of human metabolic disorder and diseases. Accumulation of biogenic/xenogenic aldehydes in ALDH2*2 individuals are known to cause sensitivity to alcohol intoxication (hangover), ischemic tissue damage, free-radical induced damage in an organ, such as acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson's disease, other neurodegenerative diseases, alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis, cancers of upper digestive track, insensitivity to nitroglycerin treatment, and hyper-sensitivity to certain drug metabolism.\nThis invention creates an identical genetic model for animal research specifically for human subjects carrying the ALDH2*2 allele. No such genetically engineered animal exists currently. This mutation affects an estimated >1 billion people.\nThis invention offers an innovative idea for testing of drug/pharmaceuticals sensitivity and treatment in human ALDH2*2 carriers. Currently the usage of most of the prescribed pharmaceuticals does not take into account of human genetic polymorphism. This is an important aspect in research and application of pharmaco-genetics. We also provide in vitro data to indicate that ALDH2*2 enzyme may be sensitive to some drugs that are previously unknown or have not yet been described in the literature.\n\nApplications: To provide a proper human analog of the E487K (ALDH2*2) using a genetic mouse strain., Ideal animal model for commercial drug testing, treatment and drug discovery..\n\nAdvantages: The knock-out mice represents complete inactivation of the ALDH2 gene (via gene interruption) and the naturally occurring ALDH2*2 allele in the large human population., The ALDH2*2 knock-in mice are completely identical to the human ALDH2*2 carries.  The mice segregate to both heterozygous and homozygous genotypes as in the human population, It is a superior experimental system and innovation for the valuable research purposes.

Stanford University,BZ194 mAb Specific for Mouse CMKLR1,Docket #: S06-328,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/bz194-mab-specific-mouse-cmklr1,"Rat monoclonal antibody BZ194 specifically recognizes mouse serpentine receptor mCMKLR1 (aka ChemR23, DEZ).  mCMKLR1 is a novel protein possessing high homology with members of the chemoattractant receptor family, and binds the chemoattractant chemerin. Our data demonstrates selective mCMKLR1 expression by mouse macrophages ex vivo, and by dendritic cell precursors cultured in vitro.  The anti-mCMKLR1 BZ194 generates a robust staining signal when used in flow cytometry applications with mCMKLR1+ cells.\n\nApplications: Monoclonal antibodies directed against chemokine receptors have proven to be highly valuable reagents.  Scientists have used these mAbs to determine:, 1. The leukocyte expression profile of receptors during homeostasis or inflammation, 2. The role of various receptors in coordinating the immune response, 3. The role of various receptors in leukocyte development, 4. The identity of other proteins interacting with the chemokine receptor, The anti-CMKLR1 antibodies can be used in immunoprecipitation, immunoassays (i.e. ELISA), immunocytochemistry, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry., mCMKLR1 may prove to be a relatively specific marker for macrophages, currently identified by flow cytometry as being positive for CD11b and F4/80.

Stanford University,Transgenic Biotracker Mouse,Docket #: S00-167,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/transgenic-biotracker-mouse,"The transgenic biotracker mouse lines carry two or more broadly used reporters, and thus serve as sources for both labeled cells and tissues for transplantation and adoptive transfer experiments.  The reporter transgene permits in vivo tracking of a living transplant in recipient animals as well as ex vivo analysis by traditional methods such as flow cytometry and microscopy (either confocal or fluorescence).\nThe biotracker mice contain multifunctional reporter gene constructs that are composed of the coding sequences for fluorescent proteins, such as GFP and luciferases (e.g. Luc from the firefly).  The luciferases used in the current biotracker mice are either the native form, which emits yellow green light (max. 565 nm), or Stanford's red-shifted mutant, which emits in the orange-red range (max. 610 nm).\nThe biotracker mice serve as sources of traceable cells since the cells in these animals express reporters uniformly in hematopoietic cells and in all of the major tissue types analyzed thus far, including heart, muscle, skin, and pancreas (i.e. islet cells).  The cells display both fluorescence (thus enabling analysis by flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy) and luminescence (enabling in vivo measurements using in vivo bioluminescent imaging (BLI)).  The use of both reporter functions enables cells to be traced ex vivo in a luminometer or by cytometery, or cells and/or entire organs to be detected in vivo with low light imaging systems such as those that employ intensified or cooled CCD-cameras.\nAdditionally, the mice are useful as an in vivo system to follow and assay the tissue distribution of novel luciferase substrates and/or methods designed to deliver small molecules to tissues.  In the transplant models the labeled tissues allow monitoring of the success and immunoacceptance of the graft, and thus the mice can be used to test drugs that slow or prevent graft rejection in animal models.\nExemplary transplant applications include heart transplantation experiments.  For instance, the heart of a heterozygous CMV-GFP-luc mouse was transplanted as a heterotopic xenograft into rats and monitored for luminescence and cardiac output (heart score) for six days.  Similar studies were performed on pancreatic islets.  Further studies are ongoing on hematopoietic cells that were taken from the biotracker mouse and used to reconstitute immune deficient mice.  The goal of these efforts is to monitor the differentiation and transfer of bone marrow, hematopoietic stem cells, and other members of the hematopoietic lineage (such as T- and B-cells).\n\nAdvantages: Analysis by CCD camera: The transgenic mouse with a dual reporter allows monitoring of the cells in real time in vivo using low light imaging systems such as intensified and cooled CCD cameras.  The mouse also enables analysis of individual cells by ex vivo assays based on fluorescence detection by any number of methods (microscopy, flow cytometry).  The sensitivity of the in vivo imaging strategy that is used to detect the cell and tissue grafts allows detection of as few as 1000 cells in vivo (Edinger et al 1999, Sweeney et al. 1999)., Tracking of live transplanted cells via ubiquitously expressed reporters: There are, at present, no other modalities that allow detection of such small numbers of engrafted cells and there are no other dual function reporter transgenic mice with constitutive and ubiquitously expressed reporters.  BLI is rapid and comparatively inexpensive method for in vivo cellular and molecular imaging such that in combination with labeled tissues from lines of mice as described in this disclosure, high throughput assays that measure engraftment and survival can be used in drug screening., Inexpensive alternative to PET and SPECT imaging: The other methods for monitoring immune cell migration in situations of infection, neoplastic disease or normal development include PET and SPECT imaging, which require radiolabeled materials. BLI is an extremely sensitive and versatile imaging method that does not require radioactive materials, and when coupled with a source of labeled primary cells and tissues becomes a powerful tool for drug discovery.."

Stanford University,Anti-Pbx (long form) monoclonal antibody,Docket #: S01-245F,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/anti-pbx-long-form-monoclonal-antibody,"Researchers in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Cleary at Stanford University have developed anti-Pbx (long form) monoclonal antibodies to study transcriptional regulation, embryonic development, and tissue homeostasis.  Pbx genes code for a family of highly conserved homeodomain proteins of the TALE (three-amino acid loop extension) class that participate in multiprotein complexes to regulate developmental gene expression.  Pbx proteins also heterodimerze with the Meis/Prep subfamily of TALE-class homeodomian proteins to form trimeric complexes with Hox proteins on appropriate DNA sites that regulate developmental gene expression.  Additional isoforms of mammalian Pbx proteins arise from differential splicing of Pbx transcripts to yield high molecular-weight (MW) (Pbx1a, Pbx2, Pbx3a, and Pbx4) and low-MW (Pbx1b and Pbx3b) forms of the respective proteins.

She developed the book while working with the children at Bing Nursery School as part of the final project for a psychology course.  The story elements were chosen based on what interested the children most.  The author chose to focus on exclusion because it is a developmental issue for all children of preschool age.   After the author completed the class project and read it to the children at Bing, the book was published for all of the children at the Nursery School.\nThe book provides behavior modeling for caregivers without preaching or dogma.  It also uses simple language so that the principals of including others in social behavior are clearly expressed in terms young children will understand and relate to.\nSynopsis:\nThe story is based on a child that goes through emotions and hurt feelings as she is left out by friends during several activities.  She then learns that she will feel good if she doesn't give in to the temptation to do that to her friends too, but to find a way to include them, which makes her feel good.  This demonstrates and teaches how to deal with situations of exclusion and methods to change those behaviors through self awareness and specific techniques.\nThe inside back cover shows children how to create their own simple illustrations and suggests related activities.\nAudience:\nThe book is intended to be read to pre-school and early grade school (K-2) children.  It is most suited for childcare settings, such as pre-schools, home childcare, camps, or elementary schools.  It could also be used by parents or any caregiver of young children."

AAV vectors are useful for gene therapy because they can be used to transduce different types of dividing and non-dividing cells of different tissues.  They can establish stable, long-term transgene expression without the toxicity or human diseases associated with other viral vectors.  It is believed that double-stranded AAV vectors are 10 - 100 times more robust than single stranded AAV vectors and would therefore require much smaller doses than single-stranded AAV to produce a therapeutic effect.  However, a limited amount of exogenous DNA can be inserted into the double-stranded vectors.  Now, Stanford inventors have linked a synthetic liver-specific enhancer to a mini promoter to generate a Factor IX vector that can be packaged into double-stranded AAV vector.  This cassette was used to express Factor IX in vivo.\nStage of Research:\nThe inventors have used the expression cassette with double stranded AAV vectors for Factor IX gene therapy in mice.\n\nApplications: Gene therapy - for inserting genes that require liver-specific expression, Research - studying double stranded AAV vectors.\n\nAdvantages: Short - small expression cassette can be packaged into double-stranded AAV vectors, Robust - double-stranded AAV vectors are 10 - 100 times better than single stranded vectors, Lower doses - anticipate doses 10 - 20 times lower than traditional vectors for therapeutic effect, minimizing the risk of triggering an inactivating immune response, Liver-specific."

By manipulating protein activity (rather than using traditional perturbations of DNA and its expression), this method allows the study of essential genes as well as processes that occur on a fast time scale.\nThe technique relies on an engineered binding domain that degrades quickly in the absence of its small-molecule ligand.  When this unstable domain is linked to proteins of interest, the resulting fusion proteins are also degraded without the protection of the ligand.  This feature allows the activity of the fused protein to be specifically regulated with precise temporal control and excellent dose-dependent tunability of protein levels.  The rapid, reversible, tunable system could be used analyze proteins for drug discovery and basic research or as a protein activation switch in cell therapy.\nStage of Development:\nOngoing Research:\nThe inventors are currently pursuing development of:\n\nApplications: Drug discovery\n\nvalidate targets by assessing effects of controlled, transient destabilization of protein\nstudy side effects of pharmacologic agent, validate targets by assessing effects of controlled, transient destabilization of protein, study side effects of pharmacologic agent, Transgenic animals, Research Kits - to study:\n\neffects of protein knock-outs (either partial or complete knock-out)\nrole of protein during discrete physiological or developmental event, effects of protein knock-outs (either partial or complete knock-out), role of protein during discrete physiological or developmental event, Stem Cell Therapy - control activity of a fusion protein to:\n\ndifferentiate progenitor cells\nreverse differentiation of somatic cells, differentiate progenitor cells, reverse differentiation of somatic cells.\n\nAdvantages: Specific - stabilizing ligand binds fusion protein and does not affect other cell functions, Fast - upon withdrawal of the stabilizing ligand, proteins are totally degraded in 2-4 hours., Tunable- action of ligand is dose-dependent, enabling studies of proteins whose function depends on its intracellular concentration, Reversible, Versatile - system has been demonstrated with 18 different proteins, including:\n\ncytosolic\nnuclear\nmembrane-bound (both single-pass and GPCRs), cytosolic, nuclear, membrane-bound (both single-pass and GPCRs)."

Stanford University,Recombinant Dicer efficiently converts large dsRNAs into siRNAs suitable for gene silencing,Docket #: S02-028,"Published Application: WO2003093430, Published Application: 20030224432, Published Application: 20090286287, Issued: 7,556,944 (USA)",https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/recombinant-dicer-efficiently-converts-large-dsrnas-sirnas-suitable-gene-silencing,"Applications: ·	The loss-of-function phenotype of any gene in many mammalian cell culture models and vertebrate animal systems can be determined using d-siRNAs., ·	Large-scale, high-throughput functional screening can be accomplished using d-siRNAs., ·	d-siRNAs can be used in a high-throughput fashion to validate the genetic targets of drugs and small molecules., ·	d-siRNAs may be used for therapeutic applications..\n\nAdvantages: ·Simple:  siRNAs can be produced by a variety of methods: chemical synthesis, by in vitro transcription from a short DNA template, or by transfection of DNA expression construct that gives rise to a siRNA or short-hairpin-RNA (shRNA) in vivo. The advantage of using d-siRNAs instead of the currently available siRNAs is dependent on which method is used to generate the siRNA, but in general using d-siRNAs is advantageous because they are comprised of a pool of siRNAs.  In certain instances, individual siRNAs evoke a cytotoxic response thus another potent sequence must be determined.  The complexity of the d-siRNA pool avoids this issue., ·Cost effective: With our technology, for any single gene at least 300 different d-siRNAs can be produced from a ~600 base pair dsRNA at a cost equal to that required to produce an in vitro transcribed siRNA or in vivo encoded siRNA or shRNA. In addition, this cost is a few orders of magnitude less expensive than a chemically synthesized siRNA. The current price of a single chemically synthesized siRNA is around $500. The major difference in cost lies in the fact that when single siRNAs are used three to eight siRNAs may be required to attain a high probability of silencing any particular gene., ·Time efficient: d-siRNAs can be generated in two days and the phenotype can be assayed in less than one week., ·Improved gene silencing: To determine the target region of a single siRNA an educated guess must be made, but d-siRNAs obviate the need to guess. Although the rules for what makes a potent siRNA are better characterized there is a substantial chance that any single 21-nucleotide region selected from the mRNA will be ineffective in initiating mRNA cleavage or inhibiting translation. d-siRNAs target a large region (at least 500 base pairs) thereby improving the chances of silencing a gene because if there is secondary structure or protein binding in the target region silencing will not be as efficient with a single siRNA., ·Improved scale-up: Using d-siRNAs for gene silencing, scales up well for studying gene function in a high-throughput, large-scale fashion (e.g. screening of cDNA libraries).Whereas, any method using a single siRNA does not scale up well because one or more siRNA would need to be designed and generated for each gene in the genome. d-siRNAs could be generated from a cDNA library either from individual cDNAs or from pools of cDNAs, and only one pool of d-siRNAs needs to be generated for efficient gene silencing making this approach less expensive and more efficient than using single siRNAs., ·More selective: Each siRNA within the complex pool of d-siRNAs is ~1/300th the concentration thereby decreasing the likelihood of off-target effects.  Furthermore, d-siRNAs will cause destruction of a large portion of the targeted mRNA decreasing the chances of generating a truncated protein. Single siRNAs cause cleavage at one site and the resulting N-terminal truncated protein may act as a dominant negative or constitutively active protein rather than as a true protein-null., ·Unbiased:  d-siRNAs can be generated from unknown sequences providing a means to study uncharacterized gene products or genomic elements.  In a therapeutic setting, very little information about the genome of the pathogen (e.g. virus or parasite) must be known.  Furthermore, in the case rapidly mutating virions the genomic material could be repeatedly isolated from the infected cells, and converted into d-siRNAs avoiding the complications of potency involved with mismatches between the siRNA and sense RNA.."
Stanford University,fosGFP Mouse: A Novel Transgenic Mouse for Identifying Subsets of Activated Cells,Docket #: S01-257,Published Application: 20040031065,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/fosgfp-mouse-novel-transgenic-mouse-identifying-subsets-activated-cells,"The fosGFP Mouse was created to address a fundamental question in neuroscience and physiology: following a behavioral task or exposure to a drug, what are the changes in physiological properties of activated neurons and cells?\nThe fosGFP Mouse enables identification of cells that are functionally activated by a stimulus.  This identification can be done without destroying cell viability.  The fosGFP Mouse enables, for instance, identification of neurons that are functionally activated by administration of a drug.\nStage of Research:\nThe Barth Lab has visualized functionally activated GPF-labeled neurons in vivo in an array of brain areas, including hypothalamus, somatosensory cortex, and olfactory bulb.  Transgene expression in the fosGFP mouse validates what has been observed by other laboratories for cfos expression by fos immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization.  Concluded and ongoing experiments include: a) induction of fosGFP mice in a variety of experimental protocols and b) recording from activated subsets of cells after behavioral and pharmacological manipulations of the mice.\n\nApplications: Analyzing neural activation caused by a stimulus, including:, 1)	     Identifying which subsets of neurons are activated by administration of a drug, 2)	     Quantifying the level of neural activation caused by a drug, 3)      Analyzing a drug's neural activation over time, 4)	     Visualizing neural activation caused by depression, anger, pain or other emotional stimuli, 5)      Indentifying drugs that penetrate the blood/brain barrier, Identifying activation without immunochemisty:   The fosGFP Mouse can be used to identify cfos-expressing cells without immunohistochemistry.  This simplifies the procedure for examining cfos induction in that tissue does not require fixation, block, primary or secondary antibody application, or any washes.  It allows a much higher throughput for examination of cfos expression patterns under a variety of experimental conditions., Using DNA microarrays to generate expression profiles of labeled cells:   cfosGFP labeled cells could be used with microdissection to look at expression profiles of labeled cells using DNA microarrays.  An advantage over current technology here is it does not require you to fix or permeablize the tissue to find """"activated"""" cell, processes which decrease the amount of mRNA that you can recover from a cell..\n\nAdvantages: Detecting GFP expression in vivo without additional manipulation (e.g. fixation, dye administration)., Performing live-cell assays on subset of activated cells., Examining in vivo the electorphysiological properties of neurons., Previously neuroscientists have been able to  identify an *area* of the brain that may have been activated by a stimulus, but they were unable to isolate the particular subset of cells that are directly involved in mediating the behavior or the """"memory.""""  The fosGFP Mouse enables direct identification of this subset of cells without killing the cells.  Thus, the electrophysiological properties of the neuron can be examined and other in vivo properties of the cell (for example, its response to a pharmacological compound) can be assayed.."

Stanford University,Mouse monoclonal Anti-300kD bovine mannose 6-phosphate receptor,Docket #: S96-120,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/mouse-monoclonal-anti-300kd-bovine-mannose-6-phosphate-receptor,"Rab proteins represent a large family of ras-like GTPases that regulate distinct vesicular transport events at the level of membrane targeting and/or fusion.  We report here the primary sequence, subcellular localization and functional activity of a new member of the rab protein family, rab9.  The majority of rab9 appears to be located on the surface of late endosomes.  Rab9, purified from Escherichia coli strains expressing this protein, could be prenylated in vitro in the presence of cytosolic proteins and geranylgeranyl diphosphate.  In vitro-prenylated rab9 protein, but not C-terminally truncated rab9, stimulated the transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors from late endosomes to the trans Golgi network in a cell-free system that reconstitutes this transport step.  Rab7, a related rab protein that is also localized to late endosomes, was inactive in the in vitro transport assay, despite its efficient prenylation and capacity to bind and hydrolyze GTP.  These results strongly suggest that rab9 functions in the transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors between late endosomes and the trans Golgi network.  Moreover, our results confirm the observation that a given organelle may bear multiple rab proteins with different biological functions."
Stanford University,AKT Plasmid,Docket #: S00-130,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/akt-plasmid,"The family of protein kinases called Akt, protein kinase B (PKB), or related to A and C kinase (RAC) have been implicated in numerous biological processes including adipocyte and muscle differentiation, glycogen synthesis, glucose uptake, apoptosis and cellular proliferation.  There are 3 known isoforms of this enzyme in mammalian cells.  Akt1 and 2 contain a key regulatory serine phosphorylation site in the carboxy-terminal region of the protein.  However, the reported sequence of the rat Akt3 protein differed significantly from this in that it lacked 25 amino acids in the C-terminal region, including this key regulatory serine phosphorylation site. In the presenet studies we show that the deduced sequence of human Akt3 contains this serine and that it is phosphorylated in response to insulin.  These results indicate that huamn Akt3 is regulated similarly to Akt1 and Akt2."

Stanford University,Mouse Model for Hypertension and for Drug Screening of Antihypertensive Drugs,Docket #: S00-021,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/mouse-model-hypertension-and-drug-screening-antihypertensive-drugs,"Completed Research:\n· The invention is a genetically altered mouse that exhibits defects in regulation of smooth muscle contraction.  The genetic alteration is a knockout (lesion) of the calcium-activated potassium channel beta subunit gene.  The mouse serves several purposes:\n· Serves in evaluating potential anti-hypertensive drugs for their specificity against the calcium activated potassium channel beta1 subunit.\n· Serves as a mouse model for hypertension in evaluating drugs against other non-beta1 targets.\n· In addition, may serve similar roles for drug design for asthma and incontinence.\n\nAdvantages: The beta1 subunit is an accessory subunit of alpha subunit of the calcium-activated potassium channels. Calcium activated potassium channels alpha subunits are expressed quite ubiquitously, and in smooth muscle control tone and are likely to have an important role in blood pressure regulation.  Currently, the beta1 subunit of calcium-activated potassium channels is the target of study for antihypertensive drugs.  The reason for this is that it is specifically expressed in smooth muscle cells, and provides a means to modulate calcium activated potassium channels (and smooth muscle contraction) without affecting other tissues that also utilize alpha subunit (such as brain)., Evaluation of drug specificity is a costly and time-consuming process.  The beta1 knockout mouse may provide useful controls during pharmacological screens in evaluating drugs for specificity against the beta1 protein., Because beta1 knockout mice show an increased blood pressure but very little other pleitropic effects, the beta1 knockout mice would provide an excellent model to study anti-hypertensive drugs that target other proteins besides the beta1 subunit., The beta1 subunit is also expressed in bladder and airway smooth muscle. It could serve similar roles in drug screening against asthma and incontinence, respectively., The current mouse model for hypertension is renalectomy and requires feeding the mice excess salts.  These mice have renal problems as well and other non-hypertensive problems.  This new knockout mouse is more specific model for hypertension.."
Stanford University,Phi-Nx Helper-free Retrovirus Producer Lines,Docket #: S96-139,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/phi-nx-helper-free-retrovirus-producer-lines,"The Nolan laboratory has created second-generation retrovirus producer lines, termed Phoenix, for the generation of helper free ecotropic and amphotropic retroviruses.  The lines are based on the 293T cell line (a human embryonic kidney line transformed with adenovirus E1a and carrying a temperature sensitive T antigen co-selected with neomycin).  The unique feature of this cell line is that it is highly transfectable with either calcium phosphate-mediated transfection or lipid-based trasfection protocols--up to 50% or higher of cells can be transiently transfected.\nTwo cell lines were created, Phoenix-ECO and Phoenix-AMPHO.  Both lines were tested for helper virus production and established as being helper-virus free and are fully compatible for library  generation for retroviral gene transfer experiments.  The titres produced by these lines using standard polybrene-enhanced retroviral infection were approaching or above 10^7 per ml for both Phoenix-Eco and Phoenix-Ampho when carrying episomal constructs.  When transiently produced virus is made, titres are usually 1/2 to 1/3 that value."

Scientific data is often stored in paper-bound notebooks and unstructured computer files which can be difficult to maintain over time.  Systems exist to help scientists deal with the complex data collected during experiments but these systems lack the tools for automating the collection and storage of data annotated with sufficient information to enable analysis.  In an effort to create a better system, the inventors have developed a federated two-layer system in which a directory service is used to locate information and refer to XML documents that contain additional detail and/or data stored elsewhere.  This tool provides an internet-accessible archive for storing, analyzing, retrieving and sharing experimental data.\n\nApplications: Data storage and retrieval for:, Scientific applications:, Biological data- including FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorting) and microarray data, Medical data- including clinical trial data, Managing lab supplies, Broader applications that deal with many discrete named elements that are difficult to serve with centralized database approaches.\n\nAdvantages: Ease of search, Flexible database structure- allows cataloguing and retrieving data with associated text and numerical annotation information, Allows unique identification of materials and data, Facilitates electronic interchange of scientific data and publication of scientific findings."
Stanford University,Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) Based Vectors and Cell Lines,Docket #: S98-092,,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/feline-immunodeficiency-virus-fiv-based-vectors-and-cell-lines,"The FELIX vector system, like the PHOENIX MLV-based packaging system, produces high-titre retroviral particles capable of stably transducing a wide variety of target cells with a gene of interest.  Whereas the utility of the PHOENIX system was limited by its inability to transduce non-dividing cells, the FELIX vector system efficiently transfers genes to most cell types, dividing or nondividing.  As the FELIX vectors are based on Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV), they can deliver genes to non-dividing primary cells, as well as to dividing cells and cell lines.  In contrast to adenoviral and lipid based gene delivery systems, genes transferred by FIV are stably integrated into the target cell genome and passed on to subsequent generations of the target cell.  FELIX vectors can transfer inserts of up to 8kB - almost double the capacity of an AAV vector. The FELIX system can be used under BSL2 conditions as the vectors have been engineered to maximize safety. The FELIX vector system includes transfer vectors which carry the gene of interest, a vector which produces the FIV structural proteins, and a third vector which produces VSV-G envelope.  The system also includes 293T cells, T-antigen transformed human embryonic kidney cells, which, due to their transfectability, serve as an ideal viral producer line.\n\nApplications: Stable transfer of genes of up to 8kB in size to non-dividing or dividing cells for in vitro studies or in vivo gene therapy..\n\nAdvantages: Ability to transduce non-dividing and terminally differentiated cells., Gene of interest is permanently transferred to target cell, Three plasmid system provides safety by minimizing the chances of recombination., Derived from FIV, which is not known to be a human pathogen., Felix vectors can accommodate inserts up to 8kB., CTE (Cytoplasmic Transport Element)-based vectors allow elimination of all viral proteins except Gag-Pol., FELIX vectors are not packaged by HIV, preventing vector mobilization in human patients.."

Stanford University,Development of a Regulatable Retroviral-Vector System for Identification of Untranslated Regions of mRNAs,Docket #: S97-059,Published Application: WO9842854,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/development-regulatable-retroviral-vector-system-identification-untranslated-regions,"There are two aspects to this invention, the RetroTet-ART vectors themselves, and the use of those vectors to identify novel regulatory elements (untranslated regions, or UTR's).\nContinuous regulation is required to maintain a given cell state or allow it to change in response to the environment.  Studies of the mechanisms underlying such regulation have often been hindered by the inability ot control gene expression at will.  Among the inducible systems available for regulating gene expression in eukaryotes, the tetracycline (tet) regulatable system has distinct advantages.  It is highly specific, non-toxic and non-eukaryotic, and consequently does not have pleiotropic effcts on host cell genes.  Previously this system also had drawbacks, as it did not extinguish gene expression completely, precluding the study of toxic or growth-inhibitory gene products.  This technology is the development of a facile reversible tetracycline-inducible retroviral system (designated RetroTet-ART) in which activators and repressors together are expressed in cells.  Gene expression can now be actively repressed in the absence of tet and induced in the presence of tet, as Stanford inventors have engineered distinct dimerization domains that allow co-expression of homodimeric tet-regulated transactivators and transrepressors in the same cells, without the formation of non-functional heterodimers.  Using this system, it has been shown that growth arrest by the cell cycle inhibitor p16 is reversible and dependent on its continuous expression.\nThe identification of novel regulatory elements required for the correct expression of genes is an essential step in understanding and controlling their function.  The UTRs are known to regulate gene expression in disease states, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and myotonic dystrophy.  To aid in the study of FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS, a new modular tetracycline inducible retroviral system has been developed which contains multiple modifications of the SIN-RetroTet vector making it particularly suitable for the study of non-protein coding RNA sequences, such as the UTRs of mRNAs that are often ignored.  UTRs are known sensors of hypoxia and growth factor deprivation, stresses common to tumors and vascular compromise (ischemia).  A few UTRs are known to play a major role in regulating gene expression in these environments.  Yet the number of UTRs studied is relatively low due to the lack of tools.  This system is rapid and allows the regulated expression of a reporter gene fused with the UTR sequences in populations of thousands of independently infected cells within one week.  Using this new vector system, a number of mammalian UTRs are being analyzed and can be rapidly screened for their potential role in localization, stability, translation and growth control.  These functions are critical to gene regulation in disease states (Myotonic Dystrophy is a heritable 3'UTR disease), cancer (some UTRs are tumor suppressors), and for upregulation of genes in hypoxic environments.\nThese regulatory sequences that control gene expression in tumors and in cardiovascular comprised tissues are generally not well studied, characterized or patented.  There is a paucity of 3'UTR sequences in the data base.  This technology allows the rapid identification of novel regulatory DNA sequences with a role in cardiovascular disease and cancer.\n\nApplications: Identification and characterization of regulatory-sequences in 5'UTRs and 3'UTRs that play a role in stability, translation, and localization of mRNAs., Regulated expression of cDNAs encoding toxic molecules which at low levels could adversely affect cell growth or differentiation, thus requiring tight control., Regulated expression and characterization of untranslated RNA's or transcripts lacking an open reading frame (e.g. H19, ribozymes, antisense RNAs) that can directly or indirectly affect cell proliferation and/or differentiation., Controlled expression of therapeutic genes for gene therapy.  Regulatable and tissue-specific expression of RNAs (e.g. ribozymes, and antisense RNAs) to specifically interfere with transcription of oncogenic gene products involved in cancer..\n\nAdvantages: Only system for studying the function of untranslated RNAs with minimal extraneous sequences., Fast and efficient., Can be introduced into large populations of cells., Can be regulated (turned on and off or expressed to different levels), Modular - can be studied with and without other gene-specific sequences, Can readily be used to find interacting proteins that provide targets for drugs."
