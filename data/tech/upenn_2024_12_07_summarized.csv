"University of Pennsylvania","Intuitive, easily operated bubble user interface for augmented reality","","","https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/42216","An augmented reality user interface that displays information as a series of nested bubbles in 3D virtual space.Problem:Augmented reality (AR) is the process of superimposing graphics/sounds to what a person sees, typically by adding modifications to what is seen through a tablet or phone camera (e.g. social media filters, Pokémon GO). With widespread application from games to apps to enhanced museum experiences, it represents a rapidly growing field with a market size of 18 bn USD worldwide.As its popularity increases, so does the need for more sophisticated ways of presenting information in AR. However, designing an effective AR user interface necessitates the unique challenge of translating traditional 2D methods of organizing information into 3D.Solution:The inventors tackled the problem by taking inspiration from the directory tree organization of desktop files and folders. Rather than attempt to create an entirely new way of organizing information as others have done, they instead took advantage of a data structure with which many are already intimately familiar, resulting in a creative, user-friendly solution especially well-suited for AR.Technology Overview:The inventors designed a user interface in which information is visualized as nested bubbles superimposed on what is seen on a virtual screen. For example, when a user views his/her surroundings through a smartphone camera, an app utilizing the interface would display bubbles on screen as part of the environment. The bubbles are organized into a hierarchal structure (called the “foam”) similar to folders in a typical file system. Users can navigate the foam by interacting with their screen and/or moving in real space. The information associated with each bubble is displayed on screen in response to the user’s actions.Advantages:Unlike other AR interfaces, takes advantage of an intuitive structure already familiar to most usersDesigned to have widespread application in education, commerce, and beyond, instead of being limited to one AR application as other user interfaces are (e.g. an app)Offers additional features to enhance user engagement, including shadows for realism, popups, sound effects, and cues for the user to look aroundBubble User Interface. An example of how a nested hierarchy of information nodes may be organized abstractly as bubbles (drawn as circles) is depicted in (a). Note the hierarchy need not be as regular as pictured; bubbles can have different numbers of sub-bubbles.

These strong interactions mean that once colloids are assembled, they can only be dis-assembled by going into the isotropic state to eliminate the elastic interactions, and thus cannot be deliberately positioned at a particular location in the domain. Thus, it is difficult for passive colloidal particles to undergo directed assembly or micromanipulation.Solution:Development of active colloids as microrobots for dynamic manipulation of passive colloids.

Part of the inefficiency arises from:fixed data access processing between the local storage and memory and cloud storage.a conventional register file retrieves (“reads”) data for a processing operation by another component, then stores (“writes”) the processed data back into the register file.current load/store units allow no control over or optimized organization of scheduling or which memory registers are utilized or not utilized. Memory organization can become a limitation when processing large volumes of data.Solution:Reconfigurable architecture of memory and storage in a computer to offload functions away from the central and intelligence processing units. This allows direct access to both local and remote memory, with high bandwidth and low latency.A computational register file that reduces the latency time by combining the “write” and operation steps described above.

LNPs can ferry mRNA across the cell membrane, but their key component - lipidoid - can be difficult to synthesize, and their efficacy in delivering mRNA is variable. LNPs with degradable alkyl branched tails have been found to improve cell penetration, but these lipids are difficult to synthesize due to a lack of commercially available branched building blocks.Solution:A combinatorial method for one-pot, high-throughput, and cost-effective production of a wide variety of lipidoids with variable headgroups, body tails, and branch tails. Using this method, they create a lipidoid with “space-shuttle resembling” branched alkyl tails with degradable linkers. These tails dramatically improve mRNA delivery by enhancing endosomal escape, increasing the mRNA delivered to the cell's translation machinery. The addition of these tails to inefficacious lipidoids can increase mRNA delivery by up to three orders of magnitude. This greatly improves therapeutic protein expression. Nanoparticles created with these lipidoids would, therefore, improve outcomes for several gene therapy applications, including vaccines and cancer therapeutics.Technology:This method can be used to rapidly synthesize branched lipidoids for the construction of LNPs. LNPs sequester negatively charged mRNA and facilitate entry into the cell via their neutral charge and hydrophobic alkyl tails. The escape of the LNPs from the cell to deliver mRNA to translation machinery is facilitated by branched tails that can then detach to promote mRNA delivery, like booster rockets detaching from a space shuttle.

Of particular concern is its disproportionate burden on individuals of African ancestry, who experience a fivefold higher prevalence than European Americans and are up to 15 times more likely to suffer from vision loss due to this condition. Despite its considerable impact, the genetic basis of POAG in African ancestry populations remains largely understudied.POAG is often called the “silent thief of sight” because it is asymptomatic in early stages. It is estimated that approximately 50% of individuals with POAG are unaware that they have the disease. Early detection and intervention are essential because vision loss from POAG is irreversible. Treatments for POAG, though imperfect, can help to slow or halt disease progression in many patients.There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic methods for identifying subjects of African ancestry at risk for this blinding disease. Because POAG is familial with a strong genetic component, screening by genetic testing is a viable option. Recent studies suggest that polygenic risk scores (PRS) may have clinical utility in POAG prediction and classification, but almost all PRS have been generated from variants identified in populations of European or Asian ancestry, with diminishing predictive value in African ancestry individuals.Solution:A genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted by the inventors unveiled novel genetic risk factors associated with POAG, in addition to confirming known risk factors. These findings open new avenues for understanding the genetic complexities of POAG among African ancestry populations and offer potential targets for future diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. The inventors also developed a polygenic risk score for POAG in African ancestry individuals that can identify the patients at highest risk for the disease.Technology:The inventors conducted a GWAS where they utilized advanced genotyping and sequencing technologies to comprehensively analyze the genomes of 11,275 individuals of African ancestry. They detected 46 risk loci associated with POAG at genome-wide significance. Further functional and in silico analysis were conducted to validate the findings, identifying three likely causal variants for POAG. For individuals of African ancestry, a PRS for POAG (African ancestry individuals) outperformed a PRS from summary statistics of a much larger GWAS derived from European ancestry individuals.Advantages:A total of 46 risk loci found in significant association with POAG in individuals of African ancestry.The large sample size allowed maximal statistical power for improved risk loci identification in African ancestry individuals.A significant addition to the previous POAG GWAS that predominantly contained European or Asian ancestry individuals.Improves targeted screening and therapeutic intervention for POAG in African ancestry individuals.Quantification of the genetic architecture similarities and differences between African and non-African populations for this blinding disease.PRS derived from our African ancestry population outperformed much larger PRS from European ancestry population when tested in African datasets, showing its clinical utility to this ancestry group.Performance of PRS generated from summary statistics from GBMI (European individuals) and the discovery mega-analysis (African individuals) in independent datasets of African ancestry individuals.

The tool also creates a layer or protection (or hardening) by learning and allowing certain privileges based on learned expectations.Problem:The languages of operating systems, device drivers and embedded applications are large and unwieldy at times – resulting in unsafe and exploitable systems. Privilege separation separates a system into components, each limited to the privileges it requires to operate. Privilege separation relies on coarse-grained, process-level separation, where the virtual memory system provides isolation. Although isolating vulnerability in one component from other system components makes the system more robust to attackers, this approach often negatively affects system performance.Solution:Research from Andre DeHon’s lab at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a flexible, tag-based hardware security monitor that provides an opportunity to enforce fine-grained, hardware-accelerated privilege separation which can optimize system performance while decreasing opportunities for system exploitation.Technology:SCALPEL enables rapid self-learning of low-level privileges and the automatic creation and implementation of compartmentalization security policies for a tagged architecture. Researchers from the DeHon Lab used this tool for a hardware-accelerated security monitoring design called the PIPE (Processor Interlocks for Policy Enforcement) architecture. On the back-end,SCALPEL is a tool that automatically lowers compartmentalization policies to the PIPE for hardware-accelerated enforcement. On the front end, SCALPEL provides an optimization opportunity through a set of compartment generation algorithms to help security engineers explore the privilege-performance tradeoff space that a runtime environment can achieve.SCALPEL enables fine-grained privilege separation with hundreds of compartments to achieve a low over-privilege ratio with low overheads.Advantages:SCALPEL created policies can reduce over-privilege by orders of magnitude with hundreds of logical compartments while imposing low overheads (<5%).In cases where human expertise is available for additional fine-tuning, SCALPEL easily integrates human-supplied knowledge in its policy exploration.SCALPEL automatically implements compartmentalization strategies across the privilege-performance tradeoff space, all without manual tagging or code restructuring.Stage of Development:Proof of ConceptIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Roessler, N. and Dehon, A;ACM J Emerg Technol Comput Syst, 2021 Sept; 18(1): 1.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:21-9625-TpNCSWeb Published:8/2/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54813","**Summary:** SCALPEL is an optimization tool designed to enhance hardware-accelerated enforcement of security policies within a tagged architecture.

Previously, the inventors have developed a strong and reversible adhesive film from poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and boric acid (BA) for wound care. However, when water in the adhesive completely evaporates, the film becomes dry and stiff, resulting in a skin-stretching sensation. Additionally, continuous exposure to water could degrade the performance and ultimately dissolve the adhesive.Solution:To overcome this limitation, a biocompatible waterproof backing is added to protect the PVA/BA adhesive layer and wound site from continuous exposure to water, thus preventing the film from being dissolved. Moreover, the backing layer could provide a strong contract force that closes wounds while keeping moisture around the skin from evaporating. The film remains soft and flexible, improving patient comfort and healing. Additional water absorbing sealant and water proofing materials could be added at the edge of the adhesive to further improve the sealing.Technology:The tape comprises two layers. The adhesive layer has three components: instant adhesives consisting of water absorbing elastic hydrogel together with a water-activated instant sealant layer (PVA/BA), and a waterproof layer. Upon activation by water or moisture, this layer forms an immediate bond with the substrate.

This disease can be fatal within the first few months of life and increases the risk of liver cancer. The current treatment involves a strict drug regimen and dietary restrictions. Many people are unable to maintain this regimen and require a liver transplant. Therefore, patients need a lasting cure for HT1.Solution:Inventors developed a gene-editing method to restore tyrosine processing and cure HT1. The cure can be administered to patients with HT1 or to a fetus before birth. This method targets a non-mutated gene, making it universal for all patients regardless of their specific causal mutation. Additionally, the gene-editing method is highly specific to the target gene and the liver, minimizing off-target effects.Technology:The inventors developed a gene-editing strategy to inhibit the function of 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD) that acts upstream of the HT1-mutated enzyme (FAH). This loss of HPD function shunts the tyrosine byproducts to an alternative pathway. Specifically, the inventors used an adenine-base editor and guide RNA that targets a splice site in HPD. They packaged the editor and guide RNA in lipid nanoparticles to enhance delivery to the liver. These lipid nanoparticles can be injected by a one-time IV infusion.Advantages:One-time durable cure eliminates the need for lifelong drug treatment and dietary restrictions.Lipid-nanoparticle delivery increases on-target delivery to the liver (60-70% of alleles edited) rather than off-target organs (0-1.5% edited).Adenine base editing of a splice site has high on-target efficiency and low off-target editing: 60-70% of target alleles were edited, while none of the top 100 predicted off-target sites were edited.Stage of Development:Target IdentifiedPreclinical DiscoveryIND Enabling StudiesIntellectual Property:PCT filedDesired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:23-10295-TpNCSWeb Published:7/10/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54597","**Summary:** The technology offers a gene-editing solution for hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1), a severe genetic metabolic disorder characterized by an inability to process tyrosine.

Thus far, no significant technological advance has capitalized on this market, which is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.27% through 2030.Solution:The human gut is lined with a diverse population of microbes competing for limited resources. Thus, these microbes have evolved strategies to survive including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which can be leveraged to treat infections in humans. These peptides kill pathogens by puncturing their outer membrane and, importantly, this mechanism of action is less likely to cause antimicrobial resistance.Technology:The inventors mined the human gut metagenome by analyzing publicly available metatranscriptomic data for small open reading frames (smORFs). Candidate AMPs were synthesized and analyzed for membrane permeabilization and depolarization, propensity toward alpha helix formation, and functional antimicrobial activity. The inventors used two separate mouse models of infection to test their candidate AMPs. In the deep thigh infection model, mice were pre-treated with immunosuppressant drugs (cyclophosphamide) immediately preceding infection to simulate nosocomial infection of a deep tissue. The authors identified five lead peptides, of which one has antimicrobial activity comparable to that of polymyxin B (an approved antibiotic).Advantages:Development of resistance toward AMPs, which have non-specific mechanisms of action, is rare.Five lead compounds showed antimicrobial activity that reduced infection by as many as four orders of magnitude, which is comparable to the approved antimicrobial drug polymyxin B.Many of the discovered peptides have antimicrobial activity and synergize with each other.These AMPs modulate commensal bacteria, which may be useful to engineer the gut microbiome.Figure 1.

In particular, GJ tubes deliver directly to the jejunum (middle part of the small intestine) and are desirable long-term solutions. Existing GJ tubes incorporate retention modifications (e.g., balloons and discs) to keep the tube from falling out. However, these designs do not address a common problem - the migration of the jejunal component backward into the stomach, a medical emergency requiring urgent intervention to position the tube back into the jejunum.Solution:The inventor proposed a new GJ tube design with a post-pyloric retention device to help maintain its positioning in the small intestine once placed. The post-pyloric retention device leverages the natural anatomy (e.g., strong muscle and narrow lumen) of the junction between the stomach and small intestine to improve stability and prevent the GJ tube from moving backward.Technology:The present invention is a GJ tube containing a post-pyloric retention device immediately distal to the pylorus. The pylorus is a naturally narrow channel that prevents the retention device from dislodging and migrating back into the stomach. The retention component may be an inflatable balloon or other deployable retention device, which secures the entirety of the tube once inflated. This design effectively improves the stability of the GJ tube and avoids dislodgement by leveraging the natural anatomy of the junction between the stomach and small intestine.Advantages:Improve GJ tube retention and address the migration and dislodgement issues by adding a post-pyloric retention device.Improve gastrojejunal (GJ) retention: Keep the jejunal component of the tube from migrating back into the stomach.Less gastric outlet obstruction: Avoid possible gastric outlet obstruction by placing the retention device distal to the gastric outlet.Allow for shorter duodenal/jejunal portion of GJ tube: Increase the potential absorptive area of the gut and provide more physiologic delivery of nutrition into the duodenum rather than the jejunum.Prevent migration events that may result in unnecessary hospitalization, emergency room visits, and procedures, as well as significant dissatisfaction among patients and caregivers due to disruptions in routines, concerns about receiving adequate nutrition and/or hydration, etc.Potentially provide a safe and long-term feeding solution for patients who are immobile or immobilized.Stage of Development:Proof of ConceptIntellectual Property:Provisional FiledReference Media:Kuo, YC et al.J Vasc Interv Radiol 2008 Apr (19)4: 557.Trerotola, SO et al.J Vasc Interv Radiol 2003 Nov (14)11: 1387.Trerotola, SO et al.J Vasc Interv Radiol 2005 Dec (16)12: 1613.Trerotola, SO and Pyeritz, RE.J Vasc Interv Radiol 2009 June (20)6: 824.Trerotola, SO et al.J Vasc Interv Radiol 2010 Feb (21)2: 203.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:23-10338-TpNCSWeb Published:5/31/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54320","**Summary:** The proposed invention is a gastrojejunal (GJ) feeding tube featuring a retention device designed to secure its position in a patient after placement.

Thus, there is a need for biomarkers that can effectively predict HFpEF.Solution:The inventor identified a blood biomarker, endortrophin (i.e., collagen ProC6 neoepitope or ProC6), which strongly predicts the risk of (1) Death, (2) heart failure admission, and (3) other cardiovascular events (e.g., resuscitated cardiac arrest) in HFpEF patients and greatly outperforms other biomarkers (e.g., MAGGIC risk score and NT-proBNP).Endotrophin (ProC6) is a collagen type VI–derived peptide that has not been studied in human heart failure (HF). To examine the association between circulating endotrophin and outcomes in HFpEF patients, the inventors measured the endotrophin level in plasma samples of 205 patients enrolled in the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial. Then, the inventors conducted a participant-level meta-analysis (n=810) comprising six independent studies to further validate the findings. They discovered that high plasma concentrations of endotrophin were strongly associated with death, heart failure admission, and other primary endpoints of the trial (e.g., cardiovascular death or resuscitated cardiac arrest).Advantages:A newly identified prognostic biomarker that can predict and stratify the risk of (1) Death, (2) heart failure admission, and (3) other cardiovascular events (e.g., resuscitated cardiac arrest) in HFpEF patients.Superior predictive power of death or HF admission compared with MAGGIC risk score alone or combined with NT-proBNP.Provide prognostic information that is largely independent of MAGGIC risk score and NT-proBNP.Adding endotrophin to existing models (e.g., MAGGIC risk score and NTproBNP) significantly improved their Harrel’s C index and reclassification.Potential application in predicting the risk of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models that include endotrophin (ProC6), NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro B-type Natriuretic Peptide), and MAGGIC (Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure) risk score as predictors of: (A) the primary endpoint (including cardiovascular mortality, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for the management of HF), (B) all-cause death, and (C) death or heart failure–related hospital admission (DHFA) in TOPCAT trials (n=205). The endotrophin levels in plasma were associated with the TOPCAT primary endpoint (standardized hazard ratio [HR]=2.10; 95% CI=1.62–2.71; P<0.001), all-cause death (standardized HR=1.74; 95% CI=1.36–2.24; P<0.001), and DHFA (standardized HR=2.11; 95% CI=1.67–2.67; P<0.001).

HFpEF is a prevalent form of heart failure characterized by an inability to provide sufficient oxygen and nutrients to the body despite a normal ejection fraction. Current biomarkers, including the MAGGIC risk score and NT-proBNP, do not accurately predict the risk in these patients, contributing to a high five-year mortality rate of approximately 76%.

**Applications:** The application of endotrophin (ProC6) can be utilized in clinical settings to enhance risk stratification for HFpEF patients, potentially guiding treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. Its incorporation into diagnostic protocols may aid healthcare professionals in early identification of patients at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular events, thereby allowing for more targeted interventions.

**Problem Solved:** The technology addresses the challenge of inadequate risk prediction for patients with HFpEF, a condition with high mortality and morbidity. By providing a reliable biomarker that outperforms existing tools, it resolves the gap in effective monitoring and management of HFpEF, ultimately aiming to reduce mortality and enhance patient care.","Measuring endotrophin (ProC6) in plasma is an effective predictor of death, heart failure admission, and composite cardiovascular events in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Traditionally, researchers and clinicians have relied on functional assessments of photoreceptor function such as electroretinography (ERG) to diagnose and treat retinal disease. While these techniques are sensitive to photoreceptor loss, their resolution is insufficient to discern functional changes in individual photoreceptors. Retinal imaging with adaptive optics (AO)-enhanced ophthalmoscopes is noninvasive and has the resolution necessary to observe human photoreceptors at a cellular scale and detect structural abnormalities; however, there is a need for methods that analyze this imaging data as a noninvasive alternative to quantifying visual function.Solution:A model-based analytical tool for AO data that estimates the change in photoreceptor outer segment length upon light stimulation rather than standardizing reflectance to a pre-stimulation interval. The photoreceptor change in length is associated with cellular function, so this estimation provides a non-invasive biomarker of cone function with increased precision, signal to noise ratio, customizability, and high spatial resolution.A method for extracting the functional responses of single cone photoreceptors to light stimulation from AO imaging data.

The method described here provides a model-based approach of analyzing the same measurements to describe the effect of a change in cone optical path length (OPL) on the reflected light, accounting for the heterogeneity of the response across acquisitions. By fitting the model to the data from multiple acquisitions for each cone, that change in cone OPL over time is estimated directly.Advantages:This method demonstrates an improved signal-to-noise ratio compared to the existing variability-based method.Functional results obtained via this model may be compared against and/or calibrated with measurements of the same phenomena using other measurement modalities.The physically-based analysis approach may be more readily associated with the underlying biophysical mechanisms that mediate cone functionSingle-cone AO optoretinography is noninvasive and offers the possibility of functional measurements in the areas of the human retina with the highest cone density and smallest cone size.This model can be customized by changing key parameters, optimizing the basic formulation to different conditions, generalizing across various metrics, or varying the data fitting procedure, among others.Stage of Development:Proof of ConceptBench PrototypeReference Media:Warner, RL et al.Biomed Opt Express 2022 Dec 1; 13(12): 6561.Lassoued, A et al.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2021 Nov 18, 118(47): e2107444118.Cooper et al.Opt Express 2020 Dec 21; 28(26): 39326.Pandiyan, VP et al.Sci.

This process is usually done manually by doctors, for whom recognizing the region of interest (ROI) is trivial, but highlighting the accurate boundaries of the part can be very labor-intensive. In contrast, AI models struggle with recognizing the location of an ROI in the image but can quickly delineate the organ of interest from the rest of the image once the ROI is identified. Users are often forced to choose between the opposing approaches without finding a comfortable middle ground.Solution:Researchers have now developed a method to combine the ability of humans to recognize the ROI and the accurate delineation abilities of AI to create an automated hybrid intelligence organ recognition and delineation model, mitigating both methods' weaknesses. This process has four steps. First, a computer trims the picture from the medical scan. Then, the computer makes a rough guess about the important part within the picture based on what a knowledgeable human would guess. After that, the computer draws boxes around that area. Finally, the computer makes the selected part look neat and tidy.Technology:The model encompasses four distinct phases in image analysis. Initially, the computer system conducts image cropping, denoted as BRR (Body Region Recognition) during the first phase. In the subsequent stage, the system employs a fuzzy recognition approach, named AAR-R (Automatic Anatomy Recognition - Object Recognition), which incorporates human knowledge, to annotate the area of interest.

The only current option for patients is symptom management with existing medications.Solution:Rather than addressing each symptom separately, this new method targets the root cause of FXS-associated symptoms by deleting the excess STRs, thus preventing abnormal DNA structures.Technology:The inventors linked the pathology of FXS to the formation of abnormal DNA clustering between excess STRs in the FMR1 gene and in genes of neighboring chromosomes, blocking their normal expression.The type of DNA abnormalities and FXS symptom severity depend on STR length, with more severe disease observed in patients with over 450 repeats. Excision of the excess STRs down to 190 repeats reverses this abnormal DNA clustering and restores expression in affected genes (see Figure 1).Shortening the STRs could be achieved using pharmacological or genetic-based methods.Advantages:Reduces the number of medications FXS patients must takeMore effective than treating symptomsMore specific than any option on the market currentlyCould be adapted to other diseases caused by STR abnormalities, such as Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Friedreich’s ataxiaSchematic model of abnormal DNA organization among short tandem repeats (STRs) in Fragile X Syndrome. When STRs (symbolized by CGG trinucleotides, red lines in the figure) are of normal length (30-40, first box, top row), the FMR1 gene (black arrow) does not cluster with distal genes on neighboring chromosomes (gray arrows). When STRs reach 55 to 190 repeats (premutation length, second box, top row), FMR1 expression increases and forms inclusion bodies in the nucleus (blue circle) but does not interact with distal genes. When the STRs reach 200 repeats (short mutation-length, third box, top row), FMR1 expression drastically decreases, DNA instability occurs and distal genes cluster together through interactions between H3K9me3 domains (pink shading), altering their expression. When STRs reach 450 repeats (long mutation-length, fourth box, top row), the FMR1 gene forms an RNA-DNA hybrid structure (green and blue lines) which silences distal genes. Cutting the STRs from 450 to 190 repeats (first box, bottom row) reverses the abnormal interactions between FMR1 and distal genes.

Within the EV diagnostic field, there are two major challenges: (1) the isolation and compartmentalization of single EVs to resolve their heterogeneity and (2) the precise measurement of the proteins contained within them, which tend to be of very low abundance. Previous attempts to isolate and analyze the contents of single EVs rely on bulk analysis of their molecular cargo and include techniques like modified flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging. However, these technologies have limitations of the inability to accurately quantify EV molecular cargo with ultra-high resolution.Solution:Here, a double digital assay overcomes the challenges of isolating and compartmentalizing single EVs as well as detecting their low-abundance proteinaceous contents. This technology flows a sample containing EVs over a microwell array and relies on the Poisson distribution to load single EVs into a single microwell.

Antibody-conjugated beads and spacer beads coat the bottom of the microwells. Sample containing EVs is flowed over the microwells, loading single EVs into single microwells. This technique relies on the Poisson distribution (l=0.1) to isolate single EVs whereby the statistical likelihood of two EVs being deposited into one well is very low.

It is well known that various deep learning algorithms are fragile to seemingly innocuous changes to the environment such as background, lighting, blurring, or contrast. Currently there are no general-purpose algorithms that provide robustness against these variations in data.Solution:The novel model-based training paradigm comprises three training algorithms which provide robustness against many different forms of nuisance-based variation. The three training algorithms, which are broadly applicable to deep learning, produce training data that leads to more reliable predictive systems.Technology:A model of natural variation—a function which captures the variation in data—is first obtained either by learning the variation directly from data or by exploiting the physical laws governing the problem. Depending on the setting, such models can capture nuisances in the data such as lighting, background color, haze, snow, or contrast. Once a model has been obtained, it is used in conjunction with a robust optimization problem to train deep neural networks which are robust to the source of variation captured by the model. The main insight is that the optimization problem seeks worst-case nuisances captured by the model, and then trains the neural networks to classify correctly on these worst-case data points. In this work, three algorithmic variants are proposed which collectively facilitate a trade-off between robustness and efficiency. This pipeline is, in principle, more flexible than standard classification, as it can integrate human priors regarding relevant nuisances by selecting or composing models of natural variation.Advantages:Provides safety to systems that rely on accurate prediction such as autonomous vehiclesReusable in any number of different machine-learning systems, allowing for a wide range of applications30 percentage point improvement over state-of-the-art image classifiers when tested on subsets of ImageNet-cCan be used in non-computer vision applications, providing more versatility than current image classifiersA gallery of learned models of natural variation.

Polymer brushes exhibit an effective stimuli-response surface for controlling the interaction with nanoparticles, with potential stimuli including the solution pH or external electric field. Existing methods of polymer brush preparation methods make use of complex chemical synthesis for brush fabrication. These techniques covalently bond polymer brushes using “grafting-from” or “grafting-to” methods on the substrate. These methods can be time consuming (e.g., growing a polymer brush from the surface), narrowly applicable, energy intensive, and expensive.Solution:A fabrication method that uses selective exfoliation of a block copolymer coating to expose brush material, avoiding work-intensive chemical grafting approaches. The brush swells and stretches in response to pH stimulus, allowing for selective adsorption of nanoparticles.Technology:A grafted polystyrene (gPS) layer is fabricated on an oxide substrate (e.g., SiO2) using an ω-hydroxy-terminated polystyrene (PS), resulting in a smooth, hydrophobic surface. Over this “primer” layer, a block copolymer coating, containing PS-block-poly (2-vinyl pyridine) (P2VP) layers, is thermally annealed on the gPS, forming a parallel lamellar bilayer with PS domains on top due to the high surface energy of P2VP. To invert the structure and obtain an outer P2VP domain, methanol is used in conjunction with sonication to selectively penetrate and dissolve the P2VP domain, removing the outermost PS-block-P2VP coating and exposing the P2VP outer domain.

"University of Pennsylvania","Coherent Generation Of High-Dimensional Structured Light Using A Hyperdimensional Spin-Orbit Microlaser","","","https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/52439","The current invention describes next-generation high-capacity noise-resilient communication and computing technology. The invention describes a method to coherently generate high-dimensional structured light, including spin-orbit states, in an integrated and scalable way.Problem:On-chip information technologies are mostly limited to two-level systems due to the lack of sufficient reconfigurability to satisfy the stringent requirement for degrees of freedom, i.e., for a system with more than two energy levels, a very large number of independent parameters or degrees of freedom must be precisely controlled to generate the desired high-dimensional structured light. Generally, the expansion of dimensionalities relies on the complicated interferometric setup, which is cumbersome, requires manual tuning, and is not scalable. Recent developed vector lasers and microcavities could increase the dimensionality in a more compact way. However, it still remains a challenge to actively tune the diversified, high-dimensional superposition states of light on demand. Thus coherent generation of high-dimensional structured light, including spin-orbit states, does not seem to be practical for large-scale production.Solution:The current invention demonstrates a semiconductor micro laser exploiting spin-orbit coupling of light, wherein the polarization of the light becomes dependent on the on-chip direction of propagation, increasing the number of degrees of freedom by generating structured light states with unique polarization and phase properties. Two microcavities, coupled through a non-Hermitian synthetic gauge field, are designed to emit structured light states with six degrees of freedom using the spin-orbit coupling of light, allowing for a much larger amount of information to be encoded and processed.Technology:A hyperdimensional, spin-orbit microlaser for chip-scale flexible generation and manipulation of arbitrary four-level states, which uses integrated photonic circuits on the III/V semiconductor platform to emit spin-orbit states and uses an external laser to control the on-chip coupling, thereby coherently generating all the spin-orbit superposition states in the 4-dimensional Hilbert space. Tunable asymmetric couplings enabled by a synthetic imaginary gauge field provide flexible control of up to six degrees of freedom (DOFs), thus enabling the full coverage of a 4D Hilbert space. The vectorial state of the emitted laser beam in free space is mapped on a Bloch hypersphere defining an SU(4) symmetry, which demonstrates the dynamical generation and reconfiguration of high-dimensional superposition states with high fidelity.Advantages:Potential to further promote the precision limit in metrology, imaging, and information science.The carefully selected four spin-orbit-coupled states possess the same propagation properties and completely overlap in both space and time, thereby maintaining long-distance coherence, which is ideal for free-space quantum communication, including satellite-to-earth communication, tower to tower communication, and intracity communication.Space-division multiplexing can be used to transmit information with the use of the spin-orbit microlaser, increasing the channel capacity and the security of the communication channel.(a) The hyperdimensional microlaser, emitting in a 4D Hilbert space, consists of two same-sized microrings fabricated on a III-V semiconductor platform with 200 nm thick InGaAsP multiple quantum wells.

Two common neurodegenerative diseases that cause dementia are Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). In the United States, FTD affects an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 people, and AD, more than 6 million people. These diseases are characterized by the abnormal accumulation of protein aggregates, specifically tau and TDP-43 aggregates. Tau and TDP-43 proteins undergo abnormal folding and clump together into aggregates, which disrupt normal cellular function. Valosin-containing protein (VCP) is responsible for solubilizing and breaking down the tau and TDP-43 aggregates, preventing their accumulation, but pathogenic variants of VCP impair the breakdown of protein aggregates. Notably, other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Paget’s disease of bone, Parkinson’s Disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are also associated with pathogenic variants of VCP.Solution:The inventors identified four small molecules that allow pathogenic VCP to effectively unfold and degrade the insoluble aggregated forms of tau and TDP-43.Technology:VCP plays a role in protein quality control, and many ubiquitinated proteins (proteins tagged by ubiquitin for degradation) require pre-processing by VCP to be degraded by the proteasome. From a panel of approximately one hundred structurally distinct small molecules, the inventors discovered four compounds that increase VCP’s ATPase activity, allowing VCP to remove protein aggregates more efficiently.Advantages:VCP activity decreased tau filament aggregation by 30.1%.Small molecules increased VCP ATPase activity by more than 2 standard deviations from the mean and showed better clearing of protein aggregates.A schematic highlighting mechanisms that lead to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s Disease and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration.

"University of Pennsylvania","Shape Memory Polymer-Based Adhesive Gripper With High Conformability and High Load Capacity","","","https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/51725","Dry adhesion-based shape memory polymer (SMP) gripper with high-load capacity and a high adhesion switching ratio.Problem:Robotic arms that aim to grip and manipulate objects require grippers that can conform to flat and 3D objects while sustaining large loads. Friction-based robotic grippers can pick up 3D objects but merely flat objects and small objects. Furthermore, other adhesion-based grippers can only pick flat objects but not 3D objects. Even though there exist additional adhesion gripper designs that can grip 3D objects, their load capacity and/or adhesion switchability are not high enough.Solution:A dry adhesion-based gripper with a high adhesive load capacity that exploits an unstructured shape memory polymer (SMP) membrane with tunable stiffness, enabling rapid gripping and releasing of 3D objects. SMPs are known to be polymeric smart materials that have the ability to return from a deformed state to their original shape when triggered by an external stimulus. The stiffness of the shape memory polymer is managed by temperature control, wherein heating enables it to conform to an object’s shape while cooling stiffens the material and enables high load capacity.Technology:The inventors demonstrate a shape memory polymer (SMP)-based adhesive gripper with variable stiffness to pick and place 3D objects. Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are materials that can remember their original shape, stay in temporarily deformed shapes, and return to the original shape by an external stimulus, which makes them particularly useful in applications where flexibility and adaptability are important. The gripper is fabricated with an unstructured flat thermally responsive SMP membrane composed of two-part epoxy (EPON826 resin and Jeffamine D230 (poly (propylene glycol) bis (2-aminopropyl) ether curing agent. The SMP is connected to a flexible heater and a thermocouple attached to a heater used for measurement and control of the temperature.When the SMP is in a soft state, it is flexible and can conform to the shape of the object being picked up. This allows the gripper to make good contact with the object, which is important for achieving a strong adhesive bond. The soft state of the SMP also allows the gripper to conform to objects with irregular shapes or surfaces that might be difficult to pick up with a rigid gripper. Due to the variable stiffness of SMPs, once the SMP-based adhesive gripper has contacted the object, it can switch to a stiff state, which increases the adhesive load capacity of the gripper. This allows the gripper to hold the object securely, even if it is of a high load or has an irregular shape.Advantages:The SMP membrane is comprised of a material with low modulus in the soft state, as well as a membrane geometry with low axial and negligible bending stiffness, which makes it highly effective at adapting and conforming to nonplanar and deformable objectsUnstructured flat variable stiffness SMP membrane requires no microfabrication and can be manufactured via a simple casting processUnstructured flat variable stiffness SMP membrane enables the gripper to achieve a high load capacity and a high adhesion switching ratio, in comparison to gripper based on elastomer membranesSMP membrane exhibits no adhesion at rest, which prevents any unintended adhesionOnce the SMP membrane encounters an object and stiffens, it can passively maintain a high adhesion state without requiring continuous actuation. Soft robotic gripper offers better conformability and reduces the risk of object damage.Adhesion-based grippers can provide gripping forces that act both tangential and normal to a surfaceThe figure depicts the principle of operation of the SMP adhesive gripper. When not heated, the SMP membrane is stiff and cannot easily make conformal contact with other surfaces. During use, the SMP membrane is heated to 70oC to soften the SMP, then the membrane is contacted with the object. The contact forms by displacing the chamber supporting the SMP membrane to bring the membrane in contact with the object. While maintaining contact, the SMP membrane is cooled to 30oC. On cooling and stiffening, higher load capacity is achieved, allowing the gripping of various objects and shapes.

In severe cases, this can cause fetal growth restriction (FGR), in which the developing fetus cannot receive adequate blood flow. The only curative option for pre-eclampsia and FGR is to deliver the fetus regardless of gestational age.

However, these viral-based approaches have the potential for permanent off-target effects in other organs and must be delivered directly into the placenta via an invasive uterine injection.Solution:The inventors identified a lipid nanoparticle composition to deliver mRNA-based therapeutics to the placenta effectively. mRNA-based therapies are safer than viral alternatives as they last for a shorter time inside the body. The mRNA lipid nanoparticles can be loaded with mRNAs to treat pre-eclampsia, FGR, or other pregnancy-related disorders. They can be delivered through a regular IV without requiring invasive actions.Technology:The inventors designed and screened a library of 15 lipid nanoparticle compositions for their ability to deliver mRNA to placental cells. They then tested the lead compositions for their ability to target the uterus and placenta in mice. The lead LNP (A4) showed enhanced delivery to the placenta compared to an industry-standard LNP.

Therefore, the ability to sustain flight in the mesosphere is needed for atmospheric data collection and airspace monitoring.Solution:The microscale disks can levitate with illumination.

However, this force can also originate from varied surface topologies of an object’s top and bottom surfaces. The inventors leverage this phenomenon by creating mylar disks of submicron thickness. The bottoms of these disks are coated in carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Upon illumination, these CNT networks trap air molecules, which collide with multiple surfaces before escaping with higher velocity. This difference in molecule velocity creates a lifting force that levitates the ultrathin disks.Advantages:Disk levitates under 0.5 W/cm2 incident light intensity, comparable to natural sunlightLevitation achieved under ~10 Pa pressure, comparable to mesospheric pressuresDisk levitation can be controlled and “trapped” by casting rings of higher light intensityDisks may withstand up to 10 mg payloadOverview of disk and levitating mechanism (A) Schematic of disk surface topology and propulsive force mechanism.

If left unchecked DSP progresses, resulting in gait instability, falls, and can even lead to amputation. Current treatments are limited, consisting of either pain medication or biofeedback devices to alleviate sensory loss. No individual therapeutic addresses both pain and sensory issues simultaneously. To further complicate matters, all current methods suffer from lack of patient compliance (as low as 36%).Solution:In response, the inventors developed a nerve stimulation device that treats both pain and loss of feeling. In addition, as an implantable device there are no compliance issues.Technology Overview:The inventors designed a minimally invasive implantable system to activate nerves in the leg in response to pressure on of the foot. The device is composed of two implantable components: a pressure sensor implanted under the skin on the bottom of the foot, and a battery-powered base unit implanted in the thigh connected to the leg nerves. When the foot sensors detect pressure, they wirelessly transmit signals to the base unit to provide nerve stimulation as therapy.Advantages:Treats both the pain and loss of feeling associated with DPS simultaneously, unlike current treatments which target each concern separatelyImplant circumvents patient noncompliance, resulting in more comprehensive treatmentGreatly reduces the risk of diabetic foot ulcers and diabetes-associated amputationProposed device for DSP.

In the US alone, 33 000 patients are diagnosed yearly, 27 000 of which will die. Once metastasized, HCC shows a grim 5-year survival rate of 2%. Though immunotherapy has shown promise against several cancer types, it has thus far shown poor efficacy against HCC. There remains an unmet clinical need for better therapies against HCC.Solution:Researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine found that the RA pathway is crucial in modulating the immune response against tumors. Dr. Haldar and his team have found that inhibiting this pathway, either alone or combined with immunotherapy, promotes a tumor-rejecting immune response.Advantages:Efficient against aggressive cancers such as HCCTargets a specific isoform (RALDH1) to minimize side-effects from broader range inhibitors (e.g. that inhibit RALDH1, 2 and 3)Synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy to reduce ICB-resistant tumor size by over 50%Overview of retinoic acid (RA) pathway in solid tumor biology and compound #86 mechanism of action. Many solid tumors produce high levels of RA that inhibit the formation of tumor-suppressive dendritic cells (DCs) through activation of the RA and retinoid X (RX) receptors. It instead promotes the differentiation of tumor-permissive macrophages, thus allowing tumor persistence and growth. When RA synthesis (by targeting RALDH1 with C-86) and/or signaling (by inhibiting RAR/RXR) is inhibited, monocytes differentiate into DCs that activate T cells, which in turn kill tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Shifting the tumor microenvironment balance through inhibition of RA production is therefore desirable from a therapeutic perspective. Moreover, this approach can be combined to checkpoint inhibitors to enhance immune checkpoint blockage therapy.Stage of Development:Target IdentifiedPreclinical DiscoveryIntellectual Property:PCT FiledReference Media:Devalaraja, S. et al.;Cell 2020 Mar 19 180(6): 1098.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:21-9539-TpNCSWeb Published:6/21/2024Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/54474","**Summary:** Researchers have identified that targeting the retinoic acid (RA) pathway plays a critical role in enhancing the immune response against tumors, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a prevalent and aggressive liver cancer with a low survival rate once metastasized.

A genetic mutation causes decreased production of dystrophin, a critical protein connecting cells to surrounding tissue. This leads to improper muscle development and muscle loss. Patients suffer from motor and respiratory impairment, and many people afflicted with DMD do not survive beyond their 20s. One strategy to treat DMD is to increase utrophin, a protein with similar structure and function to dystrophin. However, current strategies to artificially upregulate utrophin have not progressed clinically, because they fail to prevent the natural degradation of utrophin mRNA following transcription.Solution:The solution is a set of synthetic site-blocking oligonucleotides (SBO) which inhibits natural degradation of utrophin mRNA. These SBOs block downregulation of utrophin, increasing its expression in muscle cells which alleviates DMD symptoms. The invention works by binding to a site in utrophin mRNA which is usually targeted for degradation. Utrophin-upregulating SBOs may be used in combination with other upregulation strategies to further increase cellular expression of therapeutic utrophin.To increase production of therapeutic utrophin in muscle cells, a set of five SBOs ranging from 24-29 base pairs were synthesized. All SBOs target the same utrophin mRNA 3’-UTR region. The SBOs increase utrophin expression by hybridizing to the Let-7c microRNA binding site. This prevents Let-7c microRNA from binding to utrophin mRNA and facilitating degradation through the RNA-induced silencing complex. Utrophin-upregulating SBOs are created using a nucleic acid mimic known as a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO) to decrease undesirable toxicity and increase tissue accumulation.Advantages:- Higher binding affinity and tissue concentration compared to other oligo alternatives- Endogenous utrophin signal increases by 1.5-fold for 48 hours in vitro- Two-fold higher utrophin protein expression in skeletal muscles in DMD mouse modelSchematic representation of the PMO-based SBO strategy to alleviate repression of utrophin gene.

Dental cavities occur when the bacteria Streptococcus mutans feeds off residual sugar on teeth and produces tooth-decaying lactic acid. Additionally, S. mutans can cause even more severe tooth decay when it associates with the fungus Candida albicans. A surface-bound carbohydrate, mannose mediates synergistic growth of bacteria/fungus colonies by helping the two species bind to each other. Disruption of mannose-mediated bacterial-fungal biofilms interaction on teeth would prevent severe dental cavities caused by these two pathogenic microorganisms.Solution:The technology is mannan-degrading enzymes (MDEs) which break down mannose on Candida albicans cell walls to prevent bacterial binding. Specific degradation of mannans on fungal cell walls stops Streptococcus mutans from adhering to the fungal cells—consequently, less co-species biofilm forms on teeth. Limiting biofilm formation decreases the exposure of teeth to microbe-generated acids and inhibits the formation of dental cavities.Technology Overview:Three mannan-degrading enzymes are used to target fungal cell walls. The enzymes: α-mannosidase, β-mannosidase, or β-mannanase breakdown mannose on Candida albicans surfaces. These enzymes target beta-mannose sugars on mannan chains. Ultimately, this reduces the viscosity of biofilms and removes binding sites used by Streptococcus mutans on enamel.Advantages:15-fold decrease in S. mutans-C. albicans interaction force after 5-minute treatment2.5-fold decrease in biofilm dry weightUp to 90% biofilm removal by mild fluid shear stress after treatmentIncreases pH on mineral surfaces (less acidity) and decrease in enamel demineralizationEfficacy of MDEs against S. mutans-C. albicans biofilms.

Non-cardiologists often lack the expertise needed to select the correct test. A cardiologist usually orders the test, but the process can be inefficient due to delays caused by waiting for the cardiologist to see the patient, schedule the test, and then to review the results when they become available.Solution:This web-based application allows non-cardiologists to decide which cardiac tests should be ordered. If the appropriate test is ordered in advance, the results can be available when the patients are first seen by the cardiologist, or in some cases, eliminate the need for the patient to be seen. This would expedite a number of workflows, such as patient disposition in the ER or listing for transplant. Improved testing may also improve the diagnosis of a patient with chest pain in an emergency room.Technology Overview:The user answers a survey of 15 clinical questions that are adapted for different clinical contexts. Each question has an “info” button that provides more information. Based on the answers, utility scores are assigned to each of 10 possible tests. 10 points, color-coded green, means there are no drawbacks to using that test. 1-9 points, color-coded yellow, means that the test may be reasonable, but with concerns. 0 points, color-coded red, indicates that the test should not be used.

While treatment options for PNIs have improved with advances in microsurgical techniques and development of nerve guidance conduits, less than 50% of PNIs show full functional recovery. The current gold standard of treatment for PNI is the use of nerve autografts, which is further limited by the availability of nerve sources, donor/recipient mismatch, and severe donor‐site morbidity associated with secondary surgical procedure.Schwann cells are peripheral nervous system glial cells that make myelin around axons. Schwann cells play a critical role in repairing damage to the peripheral nervous system related to axonal regrowth during nerve repair and regeneration.The Le group has developed a method of generating functionalized nerve guidance conduits for use in repairing PNIs. This method utilizes mesenchymal stem cells from gingiva tissue (GMSC) of a neural crest-origin and converts them into neural crest stem-like (NCSC) or Schwann cell precursor (SCP)-like cells encapsulated and cultured in 3D-collagen hydrogel.Whereas nerve guidance conduits in combination with various types of supportive cells have previously been tested for repairing PNIs, their success has varied due to a lack of uniformity in their cellular makeup and matrix embedding. GMSC-laden collagen hydrogels offer an improved approach for direct conversion of GMSCs into NCSC/SCP-like cells with the capability to trans-migrate and integrate into the aligned wall matrix of natural nerve, forming a functionalized nerve guidance conduit with unique capability for PNI regeneration and functional recovery as demonstrated in the crush-injured rat sciatic nerve model.Advantages:Fewer donor/recipient mismatch issues expectedEnhanced capability to differentiate into Schwann-like cellsShorter time interval for differentiation into Schwann-like cellsMesenchymal stem cells from gingiva are more proliferative than those from bone marrowApplications:Treatment of peripheral nerve injuriesStage of Development:Proof of concept demonstrated in ratsIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Zhang, Q et al.Mol Neurobiol.2018 Aug; 55(8): 6965.Mao, Q. et al.Tissue Eng Part A., 2019 Jun, 25(11-12): 887.Zhang, Q. et al.Sci Rep. 2018 Apr, 8(1): 6634.Zhang, Q. et al.Stem Cells Transl Med. 2017 Feb, 6(2): 458.Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:19-9008-tpNCSWeb Published:5/5/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/39786","**Summary:** A novel collagen-based nerve guidance conduit incorporates functional Schwann cell precursor-like cells derived from stem cells to accelerate the repair of peripheral nerve injuries.

DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene that lead to severe reduction or loss of dystrophin protein. Without appropriate dystrophin expression, patients experience progressive muscle degeneration and weakness that leads to early death around the third decade of life. While corticosteroids can be used to slow disease progression, there is no definitive cure for DMD.Solution:In the absence of dystrophin, the autosomal homolog utrophin has been shown to partially replace dystrophin function. Utrophin is highly expressed during fetal development, but is actively down-regulated in adult muscle through numerous post-transcriptional repression mechanisms. Rather than supplement utrophin expression using gene therapy, this technology prevents repression of endogenous utrophin transcripts in adult muscle to enhance expression.Technology Overview:Scientists in the Khurana lab used high-throughput screening to identify small molecule compounds that increase utrophin expression by acting at the 5’ and/or 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of the utrophin transcript. Lead compounds were prioritized using an algorithm developed by the Inventors that incorporates specificity and dose-response characteristics.

This is particularly problematic for acute illnesses of the vasculature, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction. In these diseases, patients are often too sick to tolerate off-target drug side effects, and systemically delivered drugs rarely accumulate to a significant extent in the organs affected by pathology.Solution:Drs. Jacob Brenner and Vladimir Muzykantov have developed a drug delivery system that can address these challenges. The drug delivery system, “Red Blood Cell (RBC)-Hitchhiking Nanoparticles” (RHNs), utilizes soft nanoparticles, such as liposomes and nanogels, loaded with drugs and the natural properties of RBCs to target the lung endothelium. The nanoparticles are adsorbed onto the surface of the RBC and delivered intravascularly. Once the nanoparticle-RBCs encounter their first capillary bed, the RBCs are physically squeezed, causing the release of the drug-loaded nanoparticles into the capillary endothelium. Since delivery is dependent on the squeezing of RBCs, the nanoparticles do not release their drug cargo until they enter the pulmonary capillaries. This approach minimizes delivery of the drug to sites other than the target organ and ensures that sufficient drug concentration reaches the target site.Advantages:Minimize off-target drug effectsMaximize delivery of drug to target organCan be delivered intravenously to target the lungs or via intra-arterial catheters to deliver to any target organ, including the brain and heartApplications:Targeted drug delivery for treatment of diseases of the capillary endothelium: ARDS, ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarctionImage courtesy ofBrenner JS et al.

A normal part of the aging process, the effects of presbyopia typically begin in humans sometime around 45 years of age.Researchers have estimated that there are close to 2 billion worldwide that have presbyopia.Monovision is a common prescription lens correction for presbyopia. With monovision, each eye is corrected to focus light from a different distance, causing one image to be blurrier than the other. The brain suppresses the blurrier image and preferentially processes the sharper one, thereby expanding the depth of field. This differential blur that occurs between the lenses results in a motion illusion that makes people misperceive the distance and directional movement of three-dimensional objects. This depth misperception has been coined as the reverse Pulfrich effect.By tinting the lens that causes the blurry image, the depth misperceptions will be eliminated. This non-invasive technique has been shown by measuring how blur differences affect neural processing times with sub-millisecond precision.Currently, the biggest challenge with monovision corrections comes from the decrease in stereovision and depth misperceptions.

PDT utilizes a drug - photosensitizer (PS) which becomes activated when exposed to a specific wavelength of light and produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that destroys adjacent cancer cells. PDT has been approved by FDA for treatment of several types of cancers and is being tested in a number of clinical trials for treatment of brain, skin, prostate, cervix, and peritoneal cavity malignancies.Dosing PDT is a critical aspect of the treatment - inadequate treatment dose may lead to residual cancer cells, while excessive doses may result in severe damage to the tissue leading to burns, swelling, pain, and scarring. Effective PDT dose depends on multiple factors such as local PS dose, tissue optical properties, oxygenation level, photobleaching, absorption and scattering of light, hemoglobin levels, damage to the tissue by surgery which are all dynamic. In addition, there is significant inter- and intra-patient variability in the PS pharmacokinetics, tissue optical properties, and local tissue oxygenation. Thus, there is a critical need for reliable dose metrics which would allow to deliver optimum PDT dose to treated tissues.Dr. Timothy Zhu of Penn Medicine has developed PDT device and system which measures light fluence rate, PS concentration, and tumor blood flow.

However, the linkage between intracellular fat accumulation and insulin resistance is poorly understood. This invention has defined the upstream connection between fat accumulation in muscle cells and insulin resistance defining a new candidate target strategy for the treatment of obesity-related metabolic disorders.Technology Overview:Obesity is driving a dramatic increase in insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes), fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular disease. Obese individuals have intracellular lipid (fat) accumulation within the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle; organs which normally are responsible for absorbing glucose from the blood in response to insulin. Intracellular lipid accumulation in these tissues impairs the response to insulin, leading to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The elusive connection between intracellular lipid accumulation and insulin resistance has been poorly understood, and thus, there are currently no therapeutics that target both the tissue toxicity downstream of lipid buildup and insulin resistance.

They are made up of bacterial cells encapsulated in a protective, sticky matrix that helps them to firmly attach to a variety of surfaces, which ultimately lead to infections, biofouling, and biocorrosion. Biofilms are often resistant to traditional antibacterial treatments so removing them is an important challenge.Most current strategies for treating biofilms rely on antimicrobials (e.g. antibiotics), which have been shown to be ineffective due to antibiotics’ inability to penetrate or break down the structure of biofilm. Therefore, new methods for biofilm treatment and removal are required.Dr. Koo, along with his collaborators, have developed a novel approach to eliminate biofilm which utilizes Catalytic Antimicrobial Robots (CARs) built with IONPs. CARs were designed to tackle all facets of biofilm resistance by simultaneously degrading the protective matrix, killing the embedded bacteria, and physically removing the biodegraded products.Activated IONPs are targeted to and through biofilms with submicrometer precision using a magnetic field, wherein they aggregate to form CARs. Upon contact with the biofilm, CARs produce bio-actives which kill bacteria and degrade the protective matrix; while in parallel, CARs mechanically remove the biodegraded biofilm material. The use of the CARs alone, or in combination with known methods, offers increased potential for full biofilm removal and reduction of contamination.Advantages:Can remove biofilms from hard to access small areasWireless technologyPrecise and automated complete removal of biofilmRetrievable after usageTunable technology; can be fashioned into various shapes and forms depending on the needApplications:Medical device companies, cleaning device companies, health systems, and food manufacturers who need effective tools for controlling biofilm infections will use our automated micro-particle robotic swarm for the degradation and removal of biofilmsStage of Development:Reduction to practiceIntellectual Property:ZA2021/04331IN479834US, EP, MX, CN, KR, CA, JP, BR, IL, AU PatentsPendingReference Media:Hwang G, et al.,Science Robotics, 2019 Apr 24; 4(29): eaaw2388Baillie, KUPenn Today 2019 Apr 24Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:19-8727-tpNCSWeb Published:8/1/2019Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/35281","**Summary:** Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are utilized to create micro-robots capable of chemically and mechanically eliminating biofilms with high precision through magnetic control.

While effective therapies exist for clinically localized prostate cancer, progression to metastatic CRPC is essentially incurable. The Androgen receptor (AR) is the most frequent driver of resistance mechanism in CRPC patients.Dr. Asangani and his team at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a new approach for the treatment of CRPC by blocking AR signaling at the transcriptional level. The researchers found that AR transcriptional activity relies on activation through a “phosphoswitch” catalyzed by CDK7.CDK7 phosphorylates the co-activator MED1 which forms a complex with AR leading to AR-mediated gene transcription. Inhibition of CDK7 disrupts the formation of this MED1-AR complex and blocks AR function.

Rapid identification of fentanyl in suspected overdose patients is critical for prompt treatment. This invention describes an easy to use point-of-care test to rapidly identify fentanyl in patient urine or on objects to detect the illicit transportation of fentanyl.Solution:This technology is a competitive lateral flow immunoassay test strip capable of acting as a point-of- care (POC) diagnostic to provide rapid ‘on-site’ detection of ≥1 ng/ml fentanyl in a nonlaboratory settings.Unlike other lateral flow assays to detect fentanyl, the described invention is the first lateral flow assay with cutoff at the clinical meaningful level of 1 ng/ml. The unique characteristics of the invention enabling this level of sensitivity compared to existing assays are covered by a US provisional patent application and may be shared under a CDA.Problem:In 112 adults that died of intravenous fentanyl overdose, the fentanyl concentrations in the urine averaged 3.9 ng/mL.

Unlike chest tube placement without guidance when using kelly clamps for stability, the chest tube guidance device places the tube in its intended intrathoracic direction correctly in the first instance, thereby avoiding repeat procedures and injury.Technology Overview:Drainage of air or fluid/blood accumulating in the pleural or chest cavity is required 5,000-10,000 times per year in the fields of trauma surgery, cardiaothoracic surgery, and emergency medicine. This is achieved through insertion of a chest tube into the thoracic cavity, with the tube ideally directed towards the apex of the lung to drain air, or towards the base to drain fluid or blood and to minimize tissue damage and reduce blood clots. However, this position is often not achieved because surgeons are blind to the motion of the chest tube once the tube is inside the thoracic cavity.Clinicians often use kelly clamps to stabilize the tube, but this directing force is limited to the incision site. When there is misplacement of a chest tube, an additional chest tube must be placed and in some cases major surgery is required to remove blood clots. This leads to increased procedures, morbidity/mortality and costs.To overcome these challenges, an L-shaped plastic chest tube introducer can be used to guide the chest tube into an optimal placement once inside the chest without interacting with the lungs and other tissues. The chest tube guidance device consists of an inner compartment and an external support.

In order to be effective, circumvention of the blood brain barrier (BBB) is required for gene therapy treatment of neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and glycogen storage diseases. One method to bypass the BBB is to place a needle via suboccipital puncture into the cisterna magna, a relatively large subarachnoid space located in the cranial vault. However, there is hesitation to utilize this technique due to potential for catastrophic injury to the brain and spinal cord.Solution:Bryan Pukenas, M.D., at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, has developed a minimally invasive catheter that enables direct access for focal delivery of gene therapy vectors to the suboccipital space of the cranial vault in a minimally invasive manner.Traditionally, catheters are navigated using fluoroscopic guidance. However, navigating catheters with only fluoroscopic guidance in the spinal canal poses significant risk of spinal cord or nerve injury since one cannot see these structures using this method. In contrast, the MIMIC catheter utilizes an embedded micro-camera permitting real-time visualization of the spinal canal contents during catheter navigation and gives operators the ability to avoid vital structures like the spinal cord and nerves as the catheter is directed from the lumbar canal to the cranial vault.In addition to increased safety and simplicity, this approach is expected to reduce the amount of required gene vector material by 10-100 fold since gene transduction is much more efficient when delivered into the cisterna magna. The technology will change the procedure of gene therapy delivery to the brain from an inpatient surgery performed by an interventionalist /neurosurgeon to an outpatient procedure.Gene therapy may become accessible for patients who otherwise would not clinically qualify for gene therapy treatment due to risks associated with surgery and post-surgical care.

Typical survival rates are under 15% over 5 years. Sarcomas can prevent the formation of tumor-killing cells by eluding immune detection, a process termed immunosuppression. These tumors are largely resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), a cancer immunotherapy which promotes the formation of tumor-killing cells. More effective strategies to target sarcomas are needed.Recently, Dr. Haldar and his team have found that sarcomas can suppress the immune system through the secretion of retinoic acid (RA), a molecule which favors the formation of immune cells unable to detect tumors. Their latest findings demonstrate that inhibiting the RA pathway in sarcomas triggers a tumor rejection response by directly boosting the formation of tumor-detecting immune cells.Dr. Haldar’s team has developed a combination therapy to bolster existing immunotherapy against sarcomas that produce high levels of RA. Their protocol combines conventional ICB therapy with molecules that block RA signaling in tumors, an approach found to greatly reduce the size and weight of tumors in mice (see figure). This strategy could enhance survival rates and quality of life for patients with sarcoma.Advantages:Renders immunotherapy efficient against unresponsive sarcoma subtypesCould potentiate other existing treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapyCould extend lifespan and increase quality of life of affected patientsApplications:Therapy against sarcomas resistant to immunotherapyPromising treatment against other cancer types using the RA pathwayBlocking retinoic acid (RA) signaling with RA receptor blocker BMS493 potentiates immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) agent anti-PD1 antibody (aPD1) to reduce tumor size in mice.

The success of immune therapy partly depends on the ability of effector cells to infiltrate tumors which in turn is dependent on tumor microenvironment.T cell trafficking through lymphoid organs and peripheral tissues is tightly controlled through endothelial addressing signals regulating homing, adhesion and transendothelial migration. Endothelium provides a barrier that prevents T cell infiltration, and thus, there is a need for new pharmacologic intervention to improve cancer immunotherapy without increasing systemic inflammation.Solution:Dr. Coukos and his team at Penn have developed methods of treating and enhancing efficacy of immunotherapy for a solid tumor by modulating the expression or activity of effector proteins such as ETRB, ET-1, ICAM-1 to guide T-cells to the tumor cells. They have shown that ETBR signaling blocks T cell adhesion to endothelium and ETBR blockade restored adhesion of T cells in vitro and markedly increased T cell homing to tumors.

Unlike standard treatment with antibiotics, which eliminate only the bacterial infection, this product would accelerate healing of the lungs to improve patient recovery time and could be given in conjunction with antibiotics.Technology Overview:Bacterial pneumonia is a leading cause of serious infection and death in children and the elderly worldwide. Even with antibiotic treatment, patients may become severely ill and require hospitalization and intensive care, followed by a prolonged recovery period. Recovery requires both eradication of the bacterial infection as well as repair to alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) caused by the infection. Failure to repair this damage increases susceptibility to recurring infection and increases the risk of development of chronic and progressive lung diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.Researchers in the laboratory of Dr. Hao Shen at the University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with Dr. Ying Tian at Temple University identified that increased expression of microRNA (miRNA) from the miR302 family coincided with regeneration of AECs. miRNA-mimics are double-stranded RNA molecules intended to “mimic” native miRNAs. The Shen Lab found that administration of miR302-mimics to mice infected with bacterial pneumonia improves AEC regeneration and lung function, and enhances mouse recovery and survival.Addition of exogenous miR302 by miRNA mimics increases proliferation of lung progenitor cells and accelerates the repair of lung injury, which is expected to shorten patient recovery times. miR302-mimics could potentially be administered in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy to improve patient outcomes.

Further, MV is a prime target for improving both patient outcomes and cost savings, since MV is the single biggest determinant in ICU Length of Stay [LOS], the single greatest driver of cost for an inpatient admission.Current evidence shows that coordination between different care team disciplines to screen and conduct weaning trials can improve patient outcomes, but they are largely performed manually and on a set schedule, translating into many missed opportunities to improve those very outcomes.Solution:Dr. Fuchs and colleagues have created the ABCDE app to continuously screen patients based on data in the electronic health record and alert the care team upon the patient reaching clinical readiness for weaning from sedation and ventilation. This information plus delirium scoring and progress with exercise is displayed in real-time on an electronic dashboard for review by ICU teams and ICU leadership.Simultaneously, alerts are sent to the respiratory therapist [RT] and registered nurse [RN], who then coordinate weaning of both the ventilator and sedative medications collaboratively.

Ventral hernia is one of the most common and serious post-operative complications with an incidence of approximately 13% amongst patients undergoing abdominal operations.Despite advances in medical imaging, pre and post-operative assessment of the abdomen and hernia repair currently relies on basic clinical evaluation of patients. However, clinical assessment poorly predicts the outcome of hernia repair surgeries. Failed repairs generate un-closable midline defects; these defects require additional surgery to reconstruct the abdominal wall using a synthetic mesh. The procedure is expensive and carries a risk of chronic infection and additional complications.Solution:To better identify patients at risk for developing a hernia pre or post abdominal surgery, we have created a predictive method centered on abdominal muscle mechanical properties. This method uses magnetic resonance (MR) tissue-tagging in combination with an MR-compatible device that deforms the abdominal wall muscle synchronous with the imaging cycle.MR tissue-tagging is an imaging method that uses RF pulses to create a visible grid on organs undergoing cyclic motion to visualize the tissue deformation, which can then be used to compute the elastic properties of the abdominal muscle.

"University of Pennsylvania","Method to Produce CT-Like 3D Images of Bones and Hard Tissue From MRI Sequences","","","https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38499","Problem:Computed tomography (CT) is an imaging technique that enables 3D visualization of skeletal tissue. However, CT imaging exposes patients to hazardous radiation, which can be problematic for patients who require repeated scans or those in the pediatric population wherein the risks associated with radiation are greater.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is another imaging method that is widely used by clinicians. It exploits the magnetic properties of objects placed in a strong magnetic field to produce images by emitting radio frequency (RF) pulses to an object and detecting an RF “echo” from the object. Unlike CT, MRI does not expose patients to hazardous radiation, however, standard MRI sequences only visualize soft tissue. Current imaging sequences do not capture signal from bones because it is significantly shorter than the delay between the RF pulse and the detected echo. Recent ultra-short echo time methods have addressed this problem; however, they suffer from minimal contrast between soft and hard tissues. MRI scans are also inherently slower than CT scans as MRI data acquisition involves repeated measurement of the echoes obtained with minor changes in the total magnetic field in every repetition, which generates redundant data.Solution:This method combines long echo and short echo 3D imaging methods to distinguish signals from hard and soft tissues.

It is caused by mutations in the DMD gene leading to an absence or severe reduction of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. There is currently no cure for DMD and all dystrophin-based approaches are associated with immunoreactivity limiting their long-term efficacy.Solution:Dr. Khurana and colleagues at University of Pennsylvania developed a method to upregulate utrophin, a dystrophin homolog protein, using CRISPR-Cas9 based genome editing and AAV-based delivery. The inventors have previously demonstrated in a mouse model that inhibiting the interaction between the let-7c miRNA and utrophin gene, which normally acts to represses expression, is able to increase utrophin expression and functionally rescue dystrophic phenotype. This discovery led to the present method that genomically edits the microRNA binding sites in the utrophin gene to ultimately upregulate utrophin expression.Unlike dystrophin-targeting gene therapy, this method is particularly attractive for therapeutic strategies, as extremely high levels of utrophin are not associated with toxicity or immunoreactivity.Advantages:No immunoreactivity associated with high levels of utrophin in vivoRescues dystrophic phenotypeApplication:Therapeutic for Duchenne Muscular DystrophyGene editing method to delete interaction between miRNA and utrophin gene leading to increased expression of utrophin.Stage of Development:In vitro dataAnimal studies plannedIntellectual Property:US PatentPendingReference Media:Mishra et al.PLoS One 2017 12(10): e0182676Desired Partnerships:LicenseCo-developmentCase ID:18-8707-tpNCSWeb Published:2/13/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38536","**Summary:** Gene therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) employs CRISPR-Cas9 based genome editing to delete let-7c miRNA binding sites, coupled with AAV-based delivery to enhance utrophin expression.

"University of Pennsylvania","Therapeutic to Mitigate Epilepsy and Autism Development in Newborn Seizure Patients","","","https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38500","Neonatal brains are at high risk for seizures due to heightened electrical activity corresponding to neural development. Though anticonvulsant drugs exist to treat the seizures immediately, certain synaptic receptors (CP-AMPARs) become highly expressed, increasing the likelihood of developing epilepsy and autism-spectrum disorders. The inventors propose using CP-AMPAR blockers such as IEM-1460 to curb CP-AMPAR activity and prevent development of epilepsy and other neurological disorders.Problem:Neonatal brains are constantly in a state of electrical excitation due to the heightened neural activity required during development. They are therefore prone to hypoxic seizures, which can lead to long term synaptic development issues.AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are involved in the synaptic transmission of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system and one subset of these AMPARs are calcium-permeable (CP-AMPARs) because they lack the GluR2 subunit. In infants experiencing hypoxic seizures, these CP-AMPARs are upregulated and simultaneously, MeCP2, a transcription factor linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) becomes phosphorylated. MeCP2 is involved with synapse and dendrite development and neuronal maturation and thus, disruptions in its expression can lead to ASDs or epilepsy.AMPAR blockers have been considered as antiepileptogenetic drug candidates though they are not specific enough to target only CP-AMPARs.Solution:The inventors have therefore proposed using CP-AMPAR blockers such as IEM-1460 to inhibit CP-AMPAR activity and reduce MeCP2 phosphorylation. These CP-AMPAR blockers prevent the permeation of calcium into the neurons and as a result, the MeCP2 phosphorylation is inhibited.Advantages:Highly specific therapeutic that can be dose-adjusted for the patient’s ageEffectively reduces calcium influx into the neuron to inhibit MeCP2 phosphorylationApplications:An age-specific therapeutic to be used in patients who have suffered from neonatal seizuresCould be part of a drug cocktail along with other AMPAR blockers to effectively block epileptogenesisTop: Hippocampal GLUA2 expression decreases 48 h post hypoxia induced seizure.

This technique could be applied for both diagnostic purposes as well as the precise measurement of treatment response to both existing and experimental therapies for retinal diseases.Technology Overview:Functional assessments of vision, such as visual acuity, visual fields, microperimtery, and electroretingorams are critical for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of retinal diseases. These techniques are sensitive only for examining the function of a large area of retina and have insufficient resolution for detecting functional changes anywhere close to the scale of individual cones. This represents a significant gap in our ophthalmic assessment capabilities, especially given that current therapeutic approaches are attempting to restore function to individual photoreceptors.Noninvasive cellular-scale observation of the structure of human photoreceptor cells is made possible through the use of adaptive optics (AO) enhanced ophthalmoscopes, but establishing noninvasive objective measures of photoreceptor function on a similar scale has been more difficult.The inventors have developed a technique to assess the intrinsic function of individual photoreceptor cells using AO enhanced ophthalmoscope images acquired with near-infrared light.

(U4592)NPM/ALK, acting through STAT3 transcription factor, selectively inhibits expression of STAT5a gene. Induction of STAT5a expression, either by gene transduction or application of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor to reverse the gene silencing, results in the inhibition of NPM/ALK expression and, consequently, death of the malignant cells.The invention also provides a method to diagnose malignancy and monitor patient’s response to therapy by analysis of the degree of DNA methylation of the gene encoding for Stat5a or its analog, their mRNA, or protein.Dr. Wasik also demonstrated that NPM/ALK induces the expression of immunosuppressive protein CD274, also known as PD-L1 or B7-H1 through STAT3. (V4957)This invention provides methods for inhibiting an oncogenic protein or its down-stream effector to suppress expression of a cell-surface protein (PDL-1) involved in inhibiting immune response against malignant cells thereby enhancing the immunogenicity of a cell. The invention includes inhibitors of function or expression of oncogenic ALK tyrosine kinase and/or other oncogenic proteins and their effectors such as STAT3 responsible for induction of expression of CD274 or its functional immunosuppressive equivalent. This approach may represent an attractive (and not mutually exclusive) alternative to inhibiting CD274 and similar immunosuppressive with antibodies.In addition, Dr. Wasik developed transformed CD4+ T cells by expressing NPM-ALK in normal human CD4+ T lymphocytes.The NPM-ALK CD4 transformed cells become immortalized and display morphology and immunophenotype of patient derived anaplastic large-cell lymphomas. This is the first method to succeed in immortalizing these cells and the first to transform normal human cells of any kind using a well-defined single oncogene relevant to human disease.Combined, these results demonstrate the relevance of targeting NPM-ALK or its downstream effectors as a potential immuno-onco-therapeutic approach.

The discovery originated from the observation that individuals with lupus exhibit elevated levels of type-1 interferon-inducible genes, correlating with the severity of the disease. A significant finding is that the deficiency of BRISC in mice leads to reduced immune cell activation and alleviates lupus symptoms. The research team has successfully identified multiple lead inhibitors aimed at BRISC and is in the process of optimizing them through medicinal chemistry and rational drug design.

**Applications:** The primary application is in the treatment of lupus, an autoimmune disease, as well as in the management of other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions that are influenced by elevated inflammatory responses.

A large problem for the agricultural industry is finding a way to grow food on less arable land, while also decreasing expensive inputs (water, nutrients, chemicals, etc…), while still maintaining competitive yields. By identifying plants that can grow in stressed environments as effectively as normal conditions, we can begin to address this problem. A key driver for this will be plants that can more effectively take in water and nutrients, which will allow them to grow successfully in more challenging environments.Solution:Research within Professor Gregory’s laboratory in the Biology Department at the University of Pennsylvania has led to the discovery of gene regulation opportunities for improving crop plant traits in response to water, heat, and nutrient-stressed situations. The over expression of a particular gene causes an increase in surface area of the root by increasing the number of root hairs. Plants regulate the ratio of root hair to non-hair cells depending on environmental signals.Studies have shown that increasing the root hair population increases the uptake of nutrients (e.g. phosphate) and water which enhances the plants ability to survive in stress environments; such as heat, drought, or nutrient deficient situations.Plants grown under nutrient-poor conditions develop a higher density and longer hair cells. Roots can only absorb inorganic phosphates, present at very low concentrations in soil. This is why phosphate starvation is one of the most common nutrient stresses in plants, and is characterized by increased root hair length, increased root hair density, increased lateral root production branching away from primary roots, and upregulated secretion of acid phosphatases to produce inorganic phosphate from organic phosphate that can be subsequently absorbed by the plant. Testing has shown that overexpression of the targeted gene improves plant tolerance to phosphate starvation through a cascade of processes that results in increased phosphate uptake through changes in the root system.Advantages:Could be designed to promote optimal nutrient uptake in less arable situations or under stress of heat, nutrient deprivation, and/or droughtCould increase growth and development in plants based on increase in efficiency of absorption of nutrientsApplications:Develop crops that are readily able to survive in stressed situations or with the use of fewer nutrient inputsIntellectual Property:US10,526,614Reference MediaFoley, S et al.;Dev Cell 2017 Apr 24 41(2): 204.Penn TodayDesired Partnerships:LicensingCo-developmentCase ID:17-8052-tpNCS-2Web Published:2/6/2020Patent Information:App TypeCountrySerial No.Patent No.File DateIssued DateExpire DateDirect Link:https://upenn.technologypublisher.com/technology/38473","**Summary:** This technology focuses on enhancing crop production amid global climate challenges and rising fertilizer costs by identifying plants capable of thriving in stressed environments.

Moreover, intravenous injections of such drugs are burdensome for patients and drive additional cost and risks. Whenever treatment involves biological compounds it further increases the cost and requires special storage, shipping, and handling.Solution:Many inflammatory diseases are mediated by inappropriately activated T cells. Regulatory T cells (Tregs), on the other hand, limit such inappropriate T cell activation, and prevent inflammatory diseases. Dr. Kambayashi has discovered that topical administration of a vitamin D3 analog MC903 leads to the release of keratinocyte-derived thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) by skin cells into circulation, which then systemically increases the number of Tregs. He further has shown that this Treg expansion leads to attenuation of inflammatory diseases such as type I and type II diabetes, multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis in mouse models.

Plants regulate the ratio of root hair to nonhair cells based on environmental signals, with plants grown under nutrient-poor conditions developing higher density and longer hair cells. Roots can only absorb inorganic phosphates, present at very low concentrations in soil, making phosphate starvation one of the most common nutrient stresses in plants. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms regulating root hair cell fate and phosphate starvation response are not well understood.Solution:The Gregory Lab has discovered that the overexpression of the GRP8 gene (glycine-rich RNA-binding protein) increases the number of root hairs on the surface of plant roots, increasing the surface area for water and nutrient absorption.

Cellular infection by HIV-1 begins when the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 binds to the T-cell receptor protein CD4 anchored to the cell membrane. This binding event induces a conformational change that exposes the binding site for the transmembrane chemokine co-receptor (CCR5 or CXCRC4), and the rearranged protein helix bundle inserts into the host cell membrane for viral entry.Solution:In a cross-university collaboration, researchers have utilized structure-based drug design and synthesized dual hotspot small molecule HIV-1 entry inhibitors in a novel structural paradigm for inhibiting the CD4-gp120 protein-protein interaction. More specifically, these inhibitors interact with the Phe43 cavity and aspartic acid D368 within the glycoprotein gp120. The D368 residue makes important contacts with CD4, and compounds that interact with this residue block the interaction with CD4 with higher potency and across a range of HIV-1 strains than previously characterized CD4-mimetic compounds.

Epoxy alcohols contain up to three functional groups (olefin, carbinol, and epoxide), for high synthetic potential in generating natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. However, there are chemoselectivity issues in differentiating allylic double bonds when synthesizing allylic epoxy alcohols.Solution:Researchers in the Walsh Lab have developed an enantio- and diastereoselective one-pot synthesis method for acyclic and allylic epoxy alcohols under mild conditions with high yields and in high enantiomeric excess. The method employs an initial asymmetric carbon-carbon bond forming reaction by adding an organozinc or divinylzinc reagent to an aldehyde.

Typically, shRNA libraries are limited to sequences that target single mRNAs. Because 7-nucleotide “seed” sequences within shRNAs are sufficient for partial inhibition of target mRNAs, shRNAs are inherently promiscuous. Thus, the single-gene-targeting approach is complicated by off-target effects, which diminish therapeutic indices, and fails to take advantage of multi-gene targeting, which enhances potency.Discovery of Drugs, Targets, and Pathways: Traditional drug discovery process involving high-throughput screening is labor-intensive, expensive, often ineffective, and infeasible when cell-culture disease models are unsuitable for microtiter-plate formats.Solution:ShRNA Drug Discovery: To challenge the single-gene-targeting paradigm of small-RNA-based therapeutic initiatives, Dr. Wilson’s lab designed, synthesized, validated, and now further optimized shRNA-expressing libraries that are completely random at the nucleotide level.Three million shRNAs can be screened in a single tissue-culture flask, selecting for the desired phenotype with “hit” sequences retrieved by PCR. Because the libraries are completely random, the screens are unbiased: favorable cell phenotypes reveal which shRNAs are most effective and least toxic. This approach allows identification of sequences that target multiple genes and/or act through non-canonical mechanisms.Discovery of Drugs, Targets, and Pathways: Random shRNA library screening can be combined with bioinformatic pattern analyses of hit sequences to identify targets, pathways, and conventional chemical-compound therapeutic candidates, bypassing in vivo delivery issues.
