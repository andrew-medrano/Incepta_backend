An Adjustable Mitral Ring for Asymmetric and Continuous Off-Bypass Annulus Reduction,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/adjustable-mitral-ring-asymmetric-and-continuous-bypass-annulus-reduction,"Researchers at Stanford University have created a novel mitral valve annuloplasty ring that can be adjusted in size off-bypass in response to regurgitation. Mitral annuloplasty ring implantation is one of the most common mitral valve surgeries to reduce mitral regurgitation by establishing proper leaflet coaptation. Mitral ring sizing is a difficult process whereby a surgeon decides how much to reduce the size of the annulus while the heart is arrested. Methods currently do not exist to adjust the ring size once the heart has been restarted, and small sizing errors often result in persistent regurgitation, which requires the surgeon to re-arrest the heart and re-perform the annuloplasty procedure. To avoid exposing patients to this additional risk, Stanford researchers have developed an annuloplasty ring with a mechanism to adjust its size after the heart has been closed and re-animated. They used custom folding and semiflexible material technologies to enable asymmetric annulus constriction via sutures routed through the ring. The suture-based tightening mechanism exits the left atrium and allows for post-implantation adjustments based on real-time heart function. This invention enables surgeons to address minor sizing errors without extensive reoperation. Figure Applications include Mitral valve annuloplasty. Advantages of the device are Off-bypass adjustability, Reduced surgery time, Improved surgical outcome."
Anatomically conforming device for tricuspid valve annuloplasty,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/anatomically-conforming-device-tricuspid-valve-annuloplasty,"Stanford researchers have designed a novel tricuspid annuloplasty ring that minimizes the risk of interrupting cardiac conduction during implantation. Tricuspid regurgitation is a prevalent heart condition in which the tricuspid valve fails to close completely during ventricular contraction. The disrupted unidirectional blood flow could lead to abnormal pressure or volume overload. Patients with moderate to severe cases may require annuloplasty, where a ring device is implanted over the annulus around the tricuspid valve to support valve leaflets. While securing the device, sutures often inadvertently cross the bundle of His in the septum, disrupting heart conduction. To avoid this complication, there is a critical need for alternate annuloplasty devices. Researchers in the Woo Lab at Stanford have created a modular annuloplasty device that avoids suture placement in conduction tissue. Its most basic form is a C-shaped band with a wide gap between the two ends to avoid traversing over the septal leaflet. The device can be further secured by adding a flexible polymer that joins the ends of the device. Alternatively, the ends can be conjoined with a bridge-like structure that bends away from the valve. The bridge is angled to conform to the septal wall and aorta, improving retention. Figure Applications include Tricuspid valve annuloplasty. Advantages of the device are No suture placement in conduction tissue, Reduced need for pacemakers, Improved retention strength, Reduced recurrent regurgitation."
Diode-pumped photonic integrated titanium-sapphire waveguide amplifier,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/diode-pumped-photonic-integrated-titanium-sapphire-waveguide-amplifier,"Stanford researchers have developed ultra-wideband amplification of near infrared signals for the first time on a photonic integrated circuit.  Previously, optical amplification on photonic integrated circuits has been limited to wavelengths longer than 1000 nm, which has restricted use in biological applications.  Furthermore, tabletop titanium-sapphire are large, cost, and require high optical pump powers.  The Stanford developed diode-pumped photonic integrated titanium-sapphire waveguide amplifier incorporates the critical near-infrared window for biological tissue, which is pivotal for medical imaging and diagnostic equipment, as well as provides an on-chip solution for applications such as quantum technology, LiDAR and beyond. The device consists of a nanophotonic crystalline thin-film titanium-sapphire optical waveguide co-integrated with a semiconductor diode-laser used to pump the titanium-sapphire waveguide. The nanophotonic titanium sapphire waveguide amplifies optical signals with wavelength ranging from 700 nm to 1000 nm. The titanium-sapphire waveguides do not absorb when the material is not pumped, and  passive propagation losses are smaller than 0.45 dB/cm. These titanium-sapphire waveguides outperform currently available optical gain waveguides, and meets the needs of a wide range of applications in photonic integrated circuits    Ti:Sapphire waveguide amplifier as stand-a-lone chip optical amplifier (Top) and Ti:Sapphire waveguide amplifier prototype (Bottom) (Image courtesy the Nanoscale and Quantum Photonics Lab) Stage of Development – Proof of Concept Prototype Applications include On chip, high performance, ultra-wideband lasers and amplifiers for:, Quantum computing, simulations, sensing, and networks, Data communications, Positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems, LiDAR, Augmented and virtual reality, Biomedical applications, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), medical devices, proton therapy, microscopy, spectroscopy, imaging, surgery, etc. .

Wafer-Scale Thin-Film Titanium:Sapphire Photonics,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/wafer-scale-thin-film-titaniumsapphire-photonics,"Using their novel fabrication process, Stanford researchers have produced the world's first practical titanium-sapphire laser on a chip, transforming a once-exclusive tabletop technology to the microscale.  With its excellent gain, broadband emission, large bandgap and high power-handling, integrated Titanium-doped Sapphire (Ti:Sapphire) photonics could dramatically change visible and near-IR laser sources.   State of the art manufacturing of integrated Ti:Sapphire technology relies on costly, size limited, highly doped Ti:Sapphire wafers which are limited in size, doping control, and uniformity. Stanford researchers start using a standard, undoped, sapphire substrate, in which a near surface level Titanium source is created via implantation of or deposition. This layer can be patterned via masked implantation, or lithographically deposited. High temperature annealing improves the doping layer quality. The damaged layer is subsequently removed leaving a uniform, clean surface layer of Ti:Sapphire at the top of the sapphire substrate. The surface-doped Ti:Sapphire is then bonded to a substrate, where the doped region lies at the interface. Finally, the undoped sapphire portions of the original material are removed, leaving a wafer-scale thin-film Ti:Sapphire platform.  By leveraging these various deposition, lithography, diffusion and annealing techniques to convert undoped sapphire substrates into surface-doped substrates at wafer scale, Stanford researchers dramatically reduce costs and miniaturize integrated Ti:Sapphire-on-Insulator photonics.   Process flow of Titanium-sapphire-on-insulator (Ti:SaOI) preparation (Image courtesy the Nanoscale and Quantum Photonics Lab) Stage of Development – Proof of Concept Prototype Applications include Wafer scale, on chip, high performance lasers and amplifiers for:, Quantum computing, simulations, sensing, and networks, Data communications, Positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems, Biomedical applications, such as medical devices, proton therapy, microscopy, spectroscopy, imaging, surgery, etc. .

Optoelectronic orchestrated microdroplet reactors for solid-phase reactions,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/optoelectronic-orchestrated-microdroplet-reactors-solid-phase-reactions,"Stanford researchers have developed a microfluidic system that uses optoelectronics for microdroplet manipulation to build synthetic oligonucleotides.  Current solutions for building oligonucleotides suffer from high error rates, low yields as the chains get longer, and high solvent use and waste production. The Stanford device (Figure 1) is inexpensively fabricated using standard PDMS soft lithography mass manufacturing technology.  Multiple integrated microfluidic channels  introduce single droplets of consistent size onto the optoelectronic substrate. The optoelectronics precisely encapsulates and decapsulates individual solid supports (i.e., polystyrene microbeads) with corresponding picoliter volume reagent microdroplets. Complete encapsulation ensures uniform reagent exposure, which reduces errors and improves the final yield rate significantly. In addition, picoliter droplet reactors replace microtiter plates, which reduces reagent consumption and waste generation by up to a million-fold.   The Hesselink Group successfully demonstrated the on-chip enzymatic oligonucleotide coupling reaction and are adapting the platform for a wider range of reactions.   This light-orchestrated microdroplet reactor platform provides quicker, more affordable, more efficient, and sustainable oligonucleotide synthesis.   FIgure 1 Schematic light-orchestrated microdroplet reactors for solid-phase reactions Applications include Compact benchtop DNA printer for researchers, Quick, affordable, custom oligonucleotide, peptide, and organic synthesis for biotech and pharmaceuticals, Automated solid-phase assays for disease diagnosis and drug discovery screening, Automated solid-phase extraction (SPE) and solid-phase combinatorial chemistry reactors for pharmaceutical analysis and development, environmental testing, and forensic science. Advantages of the device are Lower error rate and higher yield long strand oligonucleotide and peptide synthesis through uniform reagent exposure, and higher spatial resolution droplet delivery compared to current microarray based solid-phase synthesis platforms, Affordable, more sustainable, million-fold waste reduction through reduced reagent consumption, Expected higher throughput as picoliter sized droplet reaction rates are expected to be faster than existing larger reagent volume platforms."
Compositions and Methods Related to Coronavirus Therapies,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/compositions-and-methods-related-coronavirus-therapies,"Researchers at Stanford have developed fusion proteins, containing ACE2 domain linked to a fragment of non-neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody, with a greater breadth of protection than previously described similar fusion proteins. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted between humans and animals. Viral mutation and zoonotic transfer are anticipated to lead to future pandemics and largescale outbreaks.  Indeed, the COVID-19 respiratory disease likely originated in bats, and led to a pandemic with over 750 million cases and nearly seven million deaths worldwide. To date, there are a limited number of active pharmaceutical agents that are effective at treating COVID-19 or other coronavirus infections in patients. There is therefore an urgent need for therapeutics capable of treating infections arising from known coronaviruses, as well as from new coronaviruses that will arise in the future. For instance, the development of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies was a major advance in the treatment of COVID-19. However, known mAb therapies gradually become ineffective with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Stage of Development Research – in vitro Stage of Research The inventors have developed improved fusion proteins containing an antibody domain, that binds a highly conserved epitope of betacoronavirus Spike proteins on the S2 subunit, and an ACE2 domain, which serves at the neutralizing domain. SARS-CoV-2 variants are less likely to escape the binding of fusion proteins than neutralizing mAbs targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins. Applications include Use as a broad and high-potency therapeutic against coronavirus infections., Fusion protein therapies, which are likely to inhibit any betacoronavirus that uses the highly conserved ACE2 as a receptor, making them suitable for stockpiling in anticipation of the next betacoronavirus jumping from animals to humans., Use in high-risk patients with complex medication regimes.. Advantages of the device are Greater breadth of protection than previously described fusion proteins., The use of fusion proteins with enzymatically inactive ACE2 (the virus' own host receptor), which prevents adverse side effects of administering fusion proteins with active ACE2 domain. These adverse effects stem from the functions of ACE2 in regulating blood pressure and vascular tone., More efficacious in vitro activity than known anti-coronavirus mAbs., Broad neutralizing range that includes all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV-1., Expected to have few, if any, interactions with other medications a patient may be taking.."
Genetically Encoded Lysosome Targeting Chimeras for Cell-mediated Delivery,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/genetically-encoded-lysosome-targeting-chimeras-cell-mediated-delivery,"Researchers at Stanford have developed fully genetically-encodable lysosome-targeting chimeras which allow for the targeted delivery of various proteins into receiver cells. Lysosome-targeted degradation is an emerging therapeutic modality that facilitates the degradation of membrane and soluble extracellular proteins. Compared to traditional therapeutic modalities, such as small molecule or antibody-based inhibitors, targeted protein degradation offers increased potential potency and broadens the druggable proteome. These techniques generally use bifunctional molecules to recruit proteins of interest to either lysosome trafficking receptors or plasma membrane-associated ubiquitin ligases. The main drawback of the first generation of this technology, called lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs), is that they contain synthetic glycopeptides that cannot be genetically encoded, thereby limiting cell-mediated delivery applications. Stage of Development Research – in vitro Stage of Research The inventors have developed fully genetically-encodable lysosome-targeting chimeras (GELYTAC), which allow for integration into therapeutic cells for targeted delivery at desired tissue sites. This comprises fusion polypeptides containing a target binding domain and an IGF2R-binding portion of a human IGF2 protein. Applications include The engineered GELYTAC construct can secret from human cells, including primary T-cells, to drive the uptake of various proteins into receiver cells and act on local targets., Administration to a human in need with a condition requiring targeted protein degradation in an appropriate dosage to ameliorate or treat at least one symptom., Application with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier that can enhance, stabilize or facilitate the preparation of the expression cassette encoding the fusion polypeptide.. Advantages of the device are Improved potency by mutations in the IGF2 protein in the engineered GELYTAC., Integration of therapeutic proteins into the genomes of therapeutic cells for targeted delivery at diseased sites., Broad cell-mediated delivery applications., Spatially-selective targeted protein degradation.."
3D Printing of Organoid Slurries,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/3d-printing-organoid-slurries,"Researchers at Stanford have developed methods for 3D printing and post-biomanufacturing of organoid slurries in a high yield stress matrix. Biomanufactured tissues and organs on demand has been a long-standing challenge in the field of tissue engineering. Despite the advancements allowed by 3D bioprinting, current techniques remain sub-optimal for both printing dynamics and post-biomanufacturing maturation of the cells in the printing structure. Stage of Development Research – in vitro Stage of Research The inventors have developed methods for the biomanufacturing of large-scale tissue constructs. This includes methods for preparing a tissue and allowing the printed cell structure to incubate in the biocompatible matrix. The printed cell structure is generally removed from the biocompatible matrix when it has sufficient strength to be self-supporting or has developed into a contiguous tissue. Applications include The biocompatible matrix can comprise a foam, emulsion, colloid, granular medium, or gel., The biocompatible matrix can include one or more types of diverse growth media or can include polyacrylic acid., The cell bioink can comprise a slurry of compacted organoids such that they are deformed from their equilibrium shape., The cell bioink has a cell density similar to that of native tissues, and it is substantially free of exogenous material such as collagen or gelatin.. Advantages of the device are An extended time can be allowed for at least a portion of the cells in the printed cell structure to develop into a contiguous tissue. Depending on the type of cells, this can range from 24 hours up to 15-to-50 days, unlike other state-of-the-art methods where cells must be removed from the printing matrix almost immediately., The biocompatible matrix can include a rheological modifier to tune the self-healing time of the matrix; a rapid, self-healing matrix can help alleviate deformation of the printed cell structure due to the stiffness of the matrix from the high yield stress during printing., The cell bioink can be deposited in the matrix by any type of extruder sufficient to deposit the cell bioink, including a 3D printer or syringe.."
3D Heat Spreading (Heat-plating) from Semiconductor Devices,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/3d-heat-spreading-heat-plating-semiconductor-devices,"Stanford researchers have developed a novel fabrication method of high thermal conductivity 3D heat spreaders for semiconductor devices. Self-heating in the channel of semiconductor devices degrades device performance and shortens device lifetimes. In this method, a thin polycrystalline diamond layer is deposited in one step both on top and around the sides of the semiconductor devices in order to remove heat from all three dimensions, with the lowest thermal boundary resistance of 3.1 m2K/GW. This represents a significant advantage over previous fabrication methods that take multiple steps and only remove heat from two dimensions. Additionally, this fabrication method has been demonstrated to significantly improve thermal management properties on GaN semiconductors without degrading performance. This could be of particular importance for 5G and RADAR applications that use GaN semiconductor devices.  Figure Description: Reduction of the high-temperature peak with 3D integration of the diamond layer as compared to 2D or no integration of the diamond layer. (Image credit: the inventors) Stage of Development Prototype Applications include Thermal management for semiconductor devices to improve device lifetime and performance, Thermal management for improved performance of GaN PAs commonly used in 5G and RADAR stations. Advantages of the device are Simpler, one-step fabrication compared to the existing multi-step technologies for heat removal from semiconductor devices, Heat removal in three dimensions (previous fabrication methods limited to two dimensions)."
Generation and tracking of cells with precise edits,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/generation-and-tracking-cells-precise-edits,"Current methods of genetically-engineered cells require precise integration of genetic material. Genotyping is usually used to detect genetic edits; however, it's difficult to track the exact changes made in each individual cell in a large cellular mixture, especially when the cells receive multiple edits. While whole genome genotyping is available to track each cell in a mixture, the technique is expensive and time-consuming. Thus, there is a need for additional methodologies that enables quicker and cost-efficient tracking of genetic edits within cells of interest. The Fraser lab at Stanford has invented a genetic engineering platform that enables multiple cellular gene editing while tracking the exact edits being made. The invention consists of two or more CRISPEY modules covalently produced by the vector, where the combination of edits that will be made across all modules are predetermined. Each module applies edits of interest tagged with unique sequences that can be easily genotyped by DNA sequencing or other methods. When needed, the intended combination of precise edits for each can also be inferred by Sanger sequencing, NGS, or other detection methods. Unlike existing methods, the invention can be applied to a mixture of cells as well as single cell or clonal cell lineages, and provides an efficient, high-throughput, and low-cost method for genetic and cellular engineering. Applications include Tracking relative abundance of cells targeted by a mixture of edit in parallel, such as high-throughput precision editing genetic screens to:  improve industrial microbial growth select strains for improving crop yield track edited cell populations treated by genetic editing medicine track edited cell populations used in-cell therapy  , improve industrial microbial growth, select strains for improving crop yield, track edited cell populations treated by genetic editing medicine, track edited cell populations used in-cell therapy. Advantages of the device are High-throughput, cost-effective method compared to existing methods, Does not require integrating of vector into the genome, Detection of the first edit (label) that installs the unique sequencing indicates that the edit tool is functional, and higher likelihood of the rest of the cells containing the second edit that is intended, important for isolating edited cells of interest., Edits made to the same target cell iteratively can be tracked by reading past unique barcodes installed into the genetic material, The barcode label can also be associated with antibiotic markers or other markers that allow cell purification."
Improved cfDNA methylation profiling through correction of misrepaired jagged-ends,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/improved-cfdna-methylation-profiling-through-correction-misrepaired-jagged-ends,"Stanford researchers have developed an in silico method, JEEPERS, that corrects DNA methylation errors at jagged-ends, improving cfDNA methylation profiling for early cancer detection and tissue-of-origin classification. Cell free DNA (cfDNA) methylation profiling allows early cancer detection and tissue-of-origin classification. However, end repair process during library preparation for cfDNA sequencing may introduce changes in methylation patterns. To address this issue, Stanford researchers have developed JEEPERS (Jagged-End Error Polishing of Enzymatically misRepaired Sequences), a novel in silico method for correcting errors in methylation data resulting from the end repair process in double-stranded library preparation. It detects and corrects errors at jagged-ends (JEs) in silico, leveraging support from complementary strands and sibling reads. Stage of Development Proof of Concept Applications include Early cancer detection. Advantages of the device are Superior cfDNA genotyping, Identification of allele-specific methylation, hemi-methylation, and gene expression, Compatible with other methylation datasets, Low cost."
B7H3-Targeting Peptides,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/b7h3-targeting-peptides,"Theranostics represents a paradigm shift in cancer treatment, offering a more personalized and molecular approach to cancer diagnosis and treatment with striking efficacy and low toxicity. The significance of theranostics therefore lies in its ability to personalize and optimize medical treatments by tailoring them to individual patients. B7H3 is a transmembrane protein, that has recently been identified as a pan-cancer antigen with dense expression across a multitude of cancer types and with restricted expression in normal tissue, rendering B7H3-targeted radiotheranostics a viable treatment option for millions of patients. Despite the promise of B7H3, no peptide ligands have been identified. Furthermore, because the protein lacks structural and functional characterization there is currently no a priori way to design ligands. Stanford researchers have discovered B7H3-targeting peptides from peptide phage display that can be used for cancer theranostic applications, such as for diagnostic imaging and peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy. This would allow for both the diagnosis and treatment of various advanced or refractory cancers lacking other viable therapies. The newly identified peptide is the first peptide identified specific to B7H3, and when chelated to 68Ga and 177Lu, the first radionuclide therapy for B7H3. Researchers predict that the B7H3 peptide-targeted radiotherapeutics would have preferential uptake in tumor tissue where the majority of DNA damage would occur, with timely elimination from clearance organs. Stage of Development In vitro and in vivo: proof of concept in cell lines Applications include Cancer diagnostic, Radionuclide cancer therapy, Cancer theranostics. Advantages of the device are Cost effective synthesis, Can be used to diagnose and treat a range of resistant and refractory cancer types, Favorable pharmacokinetics, First peptides identified specific to B7H3  Can chelate 68Ga and 177Lu for radionuclide therapy  , Can chelate 68Ga and 177Lu for radionuclide therapy."
Efficient wide-field nanosecond imaging methods using Pockels cells for low-light applications,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/efficient-wide-field-nanosecond-imaging-methods-using-pockels-cells-low-light,"Stanford researchers at the Kasevich Lab have developed a module that can attach to any standard optical system or sensor for wide-field, time-resolved imaging. This invention enables nanosecond image gating and modulation in low-light conditions, opening new applications for wide-field imaging such as fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). This technology enables the first wide-field lifetime camera that is compatible with single-molecule microscopy. Existing sensors for wide-field nanosecond imaging (e.g. time-of-flight cameras, SPAD arrays, and gated intensifiers) sacrifice performance and are not compatible with low-light applications in bioimaging and fluorescence microscopy. The researchers have demonstrated the use of electro-optic wide-field imaging gates for nanosecond temporal resolution with high photon collection efficiency. Their method enables wide-field FLIM in a single exposure image on any standard camera sensor. By acquiring all pixels in parallel they demonstrate 5 orders of magnitude improvement in imaging speeds compared to single photon counting. They have also demonstrated 39 MHz image modulation for fluorescence lifetime microscopy of single molecules at high frame rate. This allows FLIM applications in super-resolution microscopy and observations of single-molecule dynamics such as FRET. Prototypes have been tested on commercial microscopes. On-going work: Researchers are continuing to improve the technique to allow larger imaging field-of-view, higher frequency operation, and improved electro-optic configurations. A compact and user-friendly module for MHz resonant image modulation is under development. The inventors have expanded upon this technology in  Stanford Docket 19-424: Wide-field Resonant Electro-optic Imaging Devices and Applications . Stage of Development: Figures:  Figure description-  A) Schematic of Pockels cell detection with two temporal bins. Input from an imaging system (pulsed excitation and fluorescence from a microscope is drawn) is split by two polarizing beam-splitters before and after Pockels cell.

Wide-field Resonant Electro-optic Imaging Devices and Applications,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/wide-field-resonant-electro-optic-imaging-devices-and-applications,"The Kasevich lab has expanded on an earlier invention ( Stanford Docket 18-388: "" Efficient wide-field nanosecond imaging methods using Pockels cells for low-light applications""  ) that achieves efficient ultrafast temporal imaging on standard camera sensors. Current fast camera sensors have significant drawbacks and achieve nanosecond resolution only by sacrificing performance and sensitivity. Low-cost nanosecond camera sensors with favorable performance and form-factor are more desirable, especially for applications in LIDAR and fluorescence lifetime imaging. The Kasevich lab has developed resonant electro-optic imaging techniques and optimized the design of electro-optic crystals to allow compact, low-cost, and wide angular field-of-view imaging. Embodiments include multi-layer structures of low-cost electro-optic crystals and polarization optics, configurations to reduce switching voltage, and integrated systems for wide-field imaging. This technology is an advantageous approach to Pockels cell LIDAR beyond conventional ""flash"" imaging mode – combining high distance resolution with large depth of fields, which is not possible with traditional Pockels cell approaches. It is also compatible with mode-locked laser sources and megahertz repetition rates, and facilitates compact and low-cost nanosecond imaging and LIDAR on standard CMOS sensors. Stage of Development - Prototype Applications include LIDAR with enhanced resolution at large depth of field, Wide field ultrafast imaging, LIDAR and time-of-flight imaging for remote sensing, mapping, autonomous cars, 3D cameras, 3D scanners, and foreground object detection, Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) , FLIM + wide-field microscopy techniques, Single-molecule imaging and super-resolution microscopy, Light sheet microscopy, Medical diagnostics and endoscopic imaging, High speed optical switching.

Engineering functional cardiac tissue using a twist-expand mechanical bioreactor,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/engineering-functional-cardiac-tissue-using-twist-expand-mechanical-bioreactor,"Stanford researchers have invented a twist-expand mechanical bioreactor that provides an appropriate in vitro microenvironment for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived cardiomyocytes to achieve biomimetic anisotropic alignment and form contractile cardiac tissue. Many studies have successfully demonstrated directed differentiation of iPSCs into cardiomyocytes. However, further assembling and maturing the iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to mimic the mechanics of the native heart tissue remains a challenge. To overcome this challenge, studies have created microenvironments resembling that of primary cardiomyocytes during development: micropillar structures were placed to provide a 3D environment and exogenous cues were applied to facilitate anisotropic alignment of cells for coordinated contraction and electrical conduction. The engineered tissue's maturation was improved but still not comparable to the native heart. Researchers at Stanford have devised a platform that provides a more biomimetic microenvironment (Figure 1). Using advanced 3D bioprinting technology, cells were printed with soft silicone in preferred arrangements. The print was placed in an electrically conductive bioreactor that can be actuated to apply torsional force or pneumatic pressure to the silicone to introduce twisting and contractile cardiac mechanics that the micropillar approach neglected to include. This system has the potential to form functional macro-level heart tissues from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.  Stage of Development Prototype Applications include Cardiac tissue engineering, Drug testing, Disease modeling, Developmental studies. Advantages of the device are Mimics the complex contractile pattern of the native heart tissue better than other existing systems, Potential for personalized treatment."
Modeling human sensory ascending pathway in assembloids derived from human pluripotent stem cells,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/modeling-human-sensory-ascending-pathway-assembloids-derived-human-pluripotent-stem,"The ascending somatosensory pathway transmits sensory information, including pain, touch and itch, from the peripheral nervous system to the brain. Dysfunctions in this pathway are linked to disorders like peripheral neuropathy and autism spectrum disorder. Despite a significant need for effective therapeutics modulating pain and other somatosensory modalities, clinical translation remains challenging, which is likely related to species-specific features and the lack of in vitro models to directly probe and manipulate this polysynaptic pathway. To remedy this issue, Stanford researchers have developed the first human ascending sensory pathway model using assembloids. The method involves differentiating human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells into regionalized neural organoids resembling the components of the human sensory ascending pathway (Figure 1). This model provides a unique opportunity to directly study and manipulate the human sensory ascending pathway, overcoming previous challenges. This platform also enables functional analysis, including synchronized neural activity across the entire sensory pathway, offering a powerful tool for drug discovery targeting sensory disorders. Figure:  Figure description: Building human ascending somatosensory assembloid from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Image Credit: inventors Stage of Development Proof of concept- models have shown to trigger and ascend the full sensory pathway Applications include Autism spectrum disorder, Peripheral neuropathy, Research mechanisms of sensory processing and pathogenesis, Identification of novel therapeutic targets. Advantages of the device are First human cellular model of the ascending sensory pathway, Human-Specific Sensory Circuitry: Provides the first in vitro model that resembles the human ascending somatosensory pathway, overcoming the limitations of species differences in animal models., Comprehensive Functional Analysis: Enables simultaneous monitoring of neural activity across multiple interconnected regions (sensory, spinal, thalamic, and cortical) through calcium imaging and extracellular recordings., Targeted Disease Modeling and Therapeutic Screening: Allows for the study of sensory disorders, such as pain insensitivity, through genetic manipulation (e.g., SCN9A knockout) and offers a platform for high-throughput drug discovery targeting human sensory pathways.."
Composition and Method for Autonomous RNA Switches for Translational Control,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/composition-and-method-autonomous-rna-switches-translational-control,"Stanford scientists have discovered that the untranslated region (UTR) of RNA can be engineered into autonomous switches capable of both sensing native biological conditions (e.g. T cell activation) and promptly responding by initiating the translation of a therapeutic sequence (e.g. a chimeric antigen receptor). Autonomous mRNA switches can provide dynamic regulation within cellular immunotherapies and offer broad utility in next-generation mRNA therapeutics, such as engineering chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in vivo. Ex vivo CAR T cell therapy has shown significant success in treating oncology patients and combating malignant tumors. However, this approach is limited by the expensive and time-consuming ex vivo production process, which can take several weeks, and the challenge of administering only a single effective dose to patients, leading to potential tumor relapse. In contrast, in vivo CAR T cell therapy offers a promising solution by directly engineering T cells within patients using mRNA therapeutics. This innovative approach enables rapid and customizable production, with the transient nature of mRNA therapies allowing for precise temporal control of therapeutic doses. Nevertheless, advancements are needed to develop technologies capable of sensing relevant biological conditions and tightly regulating the translation of therapeutic payloads. Novel strategies for controlling mRNA expression in T cells will enable the development of in vivo T cell therapies that can alleviate T cell dysfunction while preserving the protective immune responses required for human health. Novel engineered UTR sequences resulted in RNA elements that can sense T cell signals and modulate therapeutic mRNA expression as ON/OFF switches. These mRNA switches have been shown to induce the translation of genetic payloads upon T-cell activation. The use of these mRNA switches to control the translation of a CAR in engineered T cells resulted in the expression of the CAR and the killing of antigen-positive tumor cells. Importantly, when co-cultured with antigen-negative cells, there was no difference in CAR expression or killing when compared to baseline. Consequently, autonomous mRNA switches have the potential to enhance cellular immunotherapies and enable the development of in vivo CAR T cell therapies.

One-Time Delivery of Genetically Engineered Stem Cells Enable Long-Term Secretion of Therapeutic Antibodies for Treatment of HIV-1,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/one-time-delivery-genetically-engineered-stem-cells-enable-long-term-secretion,"Stanford researchers have engineered hematopoietic stem cells to provide long-term secretion of chosen therapeutic antibodies, eliminating the need of repeated dosing for delivery. Thirty nine million people worldwide are living with HIV infection. Autologous transplantation of specific hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is the only known cure for HIV-1 infection. However, this treatment is extremely limited due to the rarity of specific matched donors, the morbidities associated with allogeneic transplantation, and the prevalence of HIV-1 strains resistant to select gene knockout treatments alone. To circumvent these limitations, Stanford researchers genetically engineered HSPCs that secrete antibodies against various targets, including but not limited to HIV, PCSK9, and TNF-alpha. The genetically engineered HSPCs can be delivered via a one-time therapy through autologous transplantation. This technology could be used to develop autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapies for the long-term delivery of therapeutic antibodies for various diseases. The engineered cells also have the potential to improve current commercial treatment strategies that address long-term control of HIV-1 infection; A disease that currently requires lifetime administration of antiretroviral therapy. Stage of research Proof of concept Applications include Secrete antibodies against various targets (i.e. HIV, PCSK9, and TNF-alpha), Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapies, Research tool for control of HIV-1, Development of antibody treatment therapies. Advantages of the device are Long-term secretion/sustained delivery of chosen therapeutic antibodies without repeated dosing, Can express multiple antibodies simultaneously, Limited comparable cell-based products currently on the market."
G-I-ntelligent pill (GIntellipill) for active sample collection in the gastrointestinal tract,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/g-i-ntelligent-pill-gintellipill-active-sample-collection-gastrointestinal-tract,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed an ingestible smart pill to sample biomarkers from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract plays an important role in maintaining overall health, as it is responsible for digesting food, absorbing nutrients, and eliminating waste. Sampling from the GI tract, particularly its mucous layer, is essential in understanding gut health and disease. Bioanalytes from the mucus can provide insights into inflammation, metabolic function, and immune response. Currently, invasive procedures like endoscopy and colonoscopy are used to sample from the GI tract. There is a need for a non-invasive method. Smart pills have recently emerged as non-invasive sampling platforms. However, to date, they have relied on passive diffusion and thus are not suitable for viscous mucus. Stanford researchers have designed a smart pill that can be swallowed and docked at a desired location in the GI tract for active sampling of the mucus. After confirming the pill's location within the GI tract, its hydrodynamic screw is remotely actuated. The rotational motion facilitates the collection of mucus samples along its spiral path, directing them towards a dedicated collection chamber. This technology could enable easy, simple, affordable, and repeat sampling of GI tract regions of interest.  Stage of Development Prototype Applications include Precision medicine, Early disease detection, Health monitoring, Disease management. Advantages of the device are Can collect high viscosity samples, Multiple sampling locations, Cost-effective, Non-invasive, Enables frequent high quality data collection."
Spinner Device for Kidney Stone and Dust Removal,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/spinner-device-kidney-stone-and-dust-removal,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed a novel kidney stone extraction device that can be used during ureteroscopy to simultaneously remove kidney stone fragments and dust without affecting renal pressure. Kidney stones are clusters of minerals and salts that form in the urinary tract, potentially causing severe pain from urinary tract obstruction, renal injury, or infections. During ureteroscopy, an endoscope is inserted through the urethra to break up larger stones with lasers or ultrasound. Fragments are either retrieved or, if small, allowed to pass naturally. Unfortunately, residual fragments and dust often cause recurrent symptomatic obstruction and stone regrowth. Therefore, there is a critical need for a more efficient clearance method. In response, vacuum-assisted sheaths have been recently introduced. However, they remove renal fluid along with the debris, necessitating fluid infusion to sustain the renal pressure. Stanford researchers at the Zhao Lab have designed a safer and more efficient kidney stone fragments and dusts extraction device that can be used together with kidney stone breaking devices. Their device is based on rotation to manipulate the flow and create a vortex that provides a localized suction towards the device to capture the stone fragments and dusts in the device. Unlike the vacuum-assisted device, this device avoids the risk of collapsing the kidney due to irregularly reduced intrarenal pressure. Stage of Development Proof of concept – in vitro data Applications include Kidney stone removal. Advantages of the device are Complete clearance of stones of varying sizes, Reduced treatment time, Reduced risk of recurrence."

It features a BCI cursor decoder that automatically adapts to the user's brain activity, eliminating the need for frequent manual recalibration. The system records brain signals, translates them into commands to control a cursor, and enables users to perform tasks like checking email, browsing the Internet, and interacting with graphical user interfaces. Over time, it improves its accuracy by learning from the brain signals without requiring human intervention, making it more reliable and user-friendly for daily computer navigation. Applications include BCI cursor decoders using surface recording signals (EEG, MEG, fNIRS), BCI cursor decoders using intracranial approaches (ECoG, intracortical), Unsupervised retraining of cursor decoders for use in patient population. Advantages of the device are Automates BCI cursor decoder recalibration, eliminating tedious manual calibrations, Improves upon BCI cursor decoder calibration stability over time, Automatically adapts BCI cursor decoder to the user's brain activity."
Microbial-driven atmospheric CO2 conversion for large-scale carbon sequestration,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/microbial-driven-atmospheric-co2-conversion-large-scale-carbon-sequestration,"Stanford scientists have developed a method that utilizes specialized microbes to capture and convert dilute atmospheric carbon dioxide into reduced organic compounds. This innovative technology, capable of metabolizing CO2 at low, atmospheric concentrations, offers a promising approach to large-scale carbon sequestration, potentially contributing to global efforts to remove tens of gigatons of carbon dioxide annually by 2030. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a primary contributor to global warming, with atmospheric concentrations steadily increasing due to human activities. Traditional CO2 capture methods often require energy-intensive processes to concentrate and convert the gas, and there are limited end uses for CO2, reducing incentive for CO2 capture and limiting the large-scale applicability. Biological systems, particularly CO2-respiring microbes, offer a promising alternative due to their ability to metabolize CO2 at low concentrations and ambient conditions. Unlike energy-intensive chemical processes, these commonly anaerobic microorganisms can directly capture and convert dilute CO2 into useful organic compounds, operating efficiently in moderately alkaline solutions at ambient temperatures and pressures. Understanding the mechanisms of microbial CO2 metabolism and the conditions that facilitate it could lead to the development of efficient, large-scale carbon capture and conversion technologies. Preliminary experiments with the microbial CO2 capture and conversion system demonstrated successful production of reduced carbon compounds from indoor air. Importantly, the system consumed CO2 to levels below average atmospheric concentrations at sea level, indicating effective carbon sequestration. These results suggest that the microbial technology is capable of both capturing and converting dilute atmospheric CO2. Consequently, this approach has the potential to significantly contribute to global carbon sequestration efforts and transform climate change mitigation strategies by offering a sustainable method to remove CO2 from the atmosphere while producing valuable organic compounds. Stage of Development: Proof of Concept Continued research – Operation of the technology in a continuous system at a larger scale. Optimize process to maximize energetic conversion and efficiency. Identifying microbial ecologies to mediate and enhance the robustness of the process.

Advantages of the device are Captures and converts CO2 at low, atmospheric concentrations from gas or aqueous streams, Operates at ambient temperatures and pressures, reducing energy requirements, Tolerant to common industrial gas impurities like hydrogen sulfide and sulfur oxides, Potential for continuous operation without the need for regeneration steps."
Subterranean thermal energy storage system for concentrating solar power,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/subterranean-thermal-energy-storage-system-concentrating-solar-power,"Researchers in the Stanford School of Sustainability have patented a sustainable, cost-effective, scalable subsurface energy storage system with the potential to revolutionize solar thermal energy storage by making solar energy available 24/7 for a wide range of industrial applications. Subsurface thermal energy storage addresses key challenges faced by solar thermal energy: intermittency and the need for large-scale, long-term storage. Instead of using above ground insulated tanks with exotic molten salts for energy storage, this method (see Figure 1) uses the vast pore volume of depleted oil and gas fields for heat storage, which reduces above-ground infrastructure, cuts costs, increases the amount of energy that may be stored, is scalable, and potentially reduces heat losses.  The heat is stored in the reservoir until there is a demand for energy. The energy is brought to the surface and can be used to generate electricity or process heat, making the system adaptable for different industrial applications, and potentially converting solar thermal energy to a base load renewable energy.   Figure 1 Subsurface storage system for thermal energy (Image courtesy SUETRI-A) Solar collectors generate saturated steam, which is injected into underground reservoirs (ideally warmed from past thermally enhanced oil recovery (TEOR) processes, minimizing heat loss).  Heat is withdrawn from the reservoir as saturated steam and is used to operate an active thermal recovery project (such as a producing thermally enhanced oil reservoir) and/or to generate electricity. Applications include Clean energy:, Concentrated solar energy, Steam-powered electricity generation , Thermal oil recovery (TEOR) and decarbonization in oil production, Industrial processes requiring  heat. Advantages of the device are Reduces costs, Less expensive than molten salts used in conventional solar heat storage, Significantly reduces the need for above-ground infrastructure and costs compared to conventional systems, Leverages existing oil field infrastructure, Scalable, large-scale storage with expanded energy capacity, Reduces heat loss, Dual functionality and adaptable for different industrial applications, Reduces carbon dioxide footprint of thermally enhanced oil recovery  - shifts fuel from natural gas to solar radiation, Balances the daily and seasonal variations of solar radiation, Reduces operational risk - integration of existing geothermal and oil extraction techniques reduces operational risk and leverages geothermal technology to handle steam and mitigate issues like scale formation in wellbore equipment."
Plasmonic gas diffusion reactor for CO2 conversion to high-value chemicals,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/plasmonic-gas-diffusion-reactor-co2-conversion-high-value-chemicals,"Industry, government, and private investment in CO2 capture is growing to address climate change.  Without carbon utilization, however, high costs impede large scale capture efforts.  Alexander Al Zubeidi, a Stanford post doc in the D-Lab, has developed an inexpensive, scalable gas flow cell based system to convert atmospheric CO2 to other hydrocarbon based chemicals (like ethylene) using light and excess renewable electricity.   Figure 1 – Prototype Cell Process (Image courtesy the D-Lab) In the prototype system, gas enters the reactor cell via a gas flow channel, flows over the gas diffusion electrode covered in copper nanoparticles and electrolyte solution at ambient temperature.  Visible light (450-800 nm) enters through the cell window, exciting copper nanoparticle electrons that reduce CO2 to ethylene.  These electrolyzers can produce hydrocarbon based chemicals and syngas, a mixture of H2 and O2. Unlike competing electrolyzers that are built to operate on large scales, with long payback periods that typically require high capacity factors, the D-Lab system (Figure 2) can operate when renewable energy is in excess, generating net-zero emissions and converting point-source CO2 emissions to high-value products.  This inexpensive, scalable plasmonic gas flow reactor system provides cost effective carbon capture CO2 gas separation and storage while producing valuable feedstocks for the chemical industry or zero-carbon fuels.   Figure 2 – Scaled Up Reactor Array  (Image courtesy the D-Lab) Stage of Development – Proof of Concept Prototype Applications include Industrial chemical production, especially ethylene, Green fuel / hydrocarbon based fuel production, Syngas production. Advantages of the device are Low cost ethylene production with high cap-ex return:  A 20 x 20 cm2 reactor operating at 80% selectivity for ethylene at 0.5 A/ cm2 operated 6 h a day can produce enough ethylene in 1 month to pay for itself., Compact, scalable and mass producible: Easy to ship and scale up using eletrolyzers in parallel to keep production and supply chain uncomplicated., No purification of reactants: The gas diffusion electrode operates with captured CO2 and gas mixtures containing CO2, which reduces upfront costs and energy consumption., Operates at ambient temperature: The electrolyzer can be started and shut down rapidly, allowing it to only operate when electricity costs are low., Does not require CH3."
Using deep learning to predict ankle-brachial index from Doppler sounds in diabetic patients,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/using-deep-learning-predict-ankle-brachial-index-doppler-sounds-diabetic-patients,"Stanford researchers have developed AutoABI, a deep learning system that predicts ankle-brachial index (ABI) from Doppler ultrasound sounds. This approach offers a new method for ABI measurements, particularly useful for patients with non-compressible arteries, such as those with diabetes. By analyzing Doppler sounds, AutoABI provides a straightforward way to assess peripheral artery disease (PAD) risk without traditional blood pressure cuffs. The system could improve the accessibility and efficiency of PAD diagnosis in point-of-care settings, where quick and accurate assessments are valuable. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a crucial diagnostic tool for peripheral artery disease (PAD), but current measurement methods face significant limitations. Traditional ABI assessment requires inflating a blood pressure cuff while using Doppler ultrasound to measure blood flow in the tibial arteries. However, this technique proves unreliable in patients with non-compressible arteries, a common condition in diabetics with PAD. These patients often have medial arterial calcification, leading to falsely elevated and unreliable ABI readings. The prevalence of diabetes and the increasing need for accurate PAD diagnosis underscores the importance of developing more versatile, point-of-care ABI measurement techniques. An improved method that can provide reliable ABI estimates without relying on blood pressure cuffs could significantly enhance PAD diagnosis and management, particularly in challenging patient populations. AutoABI, a deep learning system integrated into a hand-held Doppler device, successfully predicts ankle-brachial index (ABI) directly from audible Doppler sounds without the need for blood pressure cuffs. This innovative approach enables ABI measurements in patients with non-compressible arteries, a common issue in diabetics with PAD. The device's on-board computer processes Doppler signals in real-time, displaying results on an integrated touch screen for immediate clinical use. By offering a more versatile and accessible method for ABI assessment, AutoABI has the potential to significantly improve PAD diagnosis and management across various healthcare settings, from hospital wards to vascular labs. Stage of Development: Prototype Continued research: fully integrating the computer and deep learning computation within the Doppler device itself, eliminating the need for external processing and creating a self-contained, portable ABI measurement system. Applications include Diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), Ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurements in patients with non-compressible arteries, such as diabetics, Point-of-care vascular health assessments in clinics and hospital wards, Integration into existing vascular lab equipment for enhanced capabilities. Advantages of the device are Eliminates the need for blood pressure cuffs in ABI measurements, Provides reliable ABI estimates for patients with calcified arteries, Increases accessibility of ABI testing in various clinical settings, Offers real-time, on-device processing and results display, Simplifies the ABI measurement process for healthcare providers, Potential for improved PAD diagnosis rates and patient outcomes."
Ultrasound Imaging with Spectral Compounding for Speckle Reduction,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/ultrasound-imaging-spectral-compounding-speckle-reduction,"Stanford researchers at the Steven Chu Lab have developed and patented a method and apparatus to optimize speckle suppression in ultrasound imaging, usable for diagnostic purposes.  This method uses Fourier-transform limited pulses for spectral compounding. The optimization of pulse shape allows for the optimization of the trade-off between speckle reduction and axial resolution. Compared to images without spectral compounding, this invention can reduce the speckle noise by 2-3X and dramatically improve image quality, as demonstrated in preliminary data. Figure Stage of Development - Proof of Concept Applications include Diagnostic Ultrasound Imaging. Advantages of the device are Method minimizes speckle for given spatial resolution, Improves image quality, Enables general diagnostic purposes."
Therapeutic targets to limit high-grade glioma spread,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/therapeutic-targets-limit-high-grade-glioma-spread,"Researchers in Dr. Michelle Monje-Deisseroth's lab at Stanford have identified therapeutic targets for drug development to limit the spread of high-grade gliomas (HGGs). HGGs, including glioblastoma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, are a group of brain cancers with dire prognosis. They frequently invade a region of the brain called the subventricular zone (SVZ) and this spread correlates with decreased survival. Currently the only therapeutic approach to limit spreading into the SVZ is not optimal as it involves irradiation of the SVZ, which can cause very serious side effects. Thus, new targeted therapeutic strategies are needed. The inventors have determined that SVZ invasion is promoted by the secretion of pleiotrophin, which forms a complex with a group of proteins that acts as a chemoattractant for the glioma to the SVZ. Therapeutic agents that inhibit this chemoattractant complex, such as inhibitory nucleic acids, thus provide a strategy for treating HGGs. This technology provides potential new targets for drug development to limit the spread of deadly brain cancers. Figure Applications include Drug development- new targets for development of therapeutics to treat gliomas, Inhibitory nucleic acids (shRNA, siRNA, miRNA, ASOs) to treat HGG spread. Advantages of the device are Unmet medical need- existing therapeutic strategy is non-optimal, Provides new targets for therapeutic development."
An automated tool for vascular and perivascular segmentation of brain MRI data to identify the risk of dementia and accelerated brain atrophy,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/automated-tool-vascular-and-perivascular-segmentation-brain-mri-data-identify-risk,"Stanford scientists have developed PVSeg, a tool that automatically segments vascular and perivascular compartments in brain MRI data. This innovative tool can identify non-demented individuals at increased risk of developing dementia and accelerated brain atrophy. PVSeg's metrics could serve as a screening tool, allowing early diagnosis of brain microvascular issues and potentially improving patient treatments and outcomes. Additionally, it could enrich clinical trials for treatments targeting cognitive decline by identifying suitable candidates at increased risk of future cognitive impairment, thereby reducing subject enrollment challenges and decreasing costs. Moreover, in clinical trials specifically targeting Alzheimer's disease pathology (amyloid-β and tau), PVSeg's metrics can refine the selection of participants with a ""purer"" form of preclinical Alzheimer's disease by identifying and screening out individuals with radiographic signs of vascular damage, improving efficiency and effectiveness of clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. Finally, PVSeg's metrics are suitable for longitudinal assessments, allowing the evaluation of treatment effects on the brain vasculature in-vivo. Cerebral small vessel disease is a significant contributor to cognitive decline and dementia. Currently, clinicians use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect signs of vascular damage in the brain, such as white matter hyperintensities and microbleeds. However, these markers are often subtle in healthy individuals and lack quantitative precision. Recent advancements allow for the measurement of brain vasculature and perivascular spaces using standard T1-weighted MRI scans. Yet, current techniques have notable limitations: they are user-dependent, leading to potential inconsistencies, and lack inter-scanner reproducibility. These drawbacks hinder the execution of large-scale, longitudinal studies and clinical trials crucial for understanding the relationship between vascular changes and cognitive impairment over time. There is a clear need for a more robust, automated method to quantify cerebral vascular structures consistently across different MRI machines and over extended periods. A novel, fully automated algorithm has been developed to assess perivascular diameter and count of blood vessels with MRI-visible perivascular space in white matter and basal ganglia using standard 3D T1-weighted MRI scans. PVSeg demonstrates excellent inter-scanner and test-retest reproducibility, addressing key limitations of current methods. Importantly, the algorithm revealed significant associations between vascular metrics and dementia risk, as well as brain atrophy rates, in a large-scale study (>10,000 subjects). By enabling more efficient screening in clinical trials, PVSeg has the potential to substantially reduce required participant numbers and to refine their selection, thereby increasing trial power and reducing costs in dementia research. Stage of Development:  Applications include Assessment of cerebral small vessel disease and its relation to cognitive decline, Early detection of individuals at high risk for dementia, Enrichment of clinical trials for cognitive impairment and dementia, Evaluation of treatment effects on brain vasculature in-vivo. Advantages of the device are Fully automated segmentation of vascular and perivascular compartments in brain MRI, Excellent inter-scanner reproducibility and test-retest repeatability, Robust performance in longitudinal studies, Requires only standard T1-weighted MRI sequences, enabling widespread use, Potential for significant cost reduction in clinical trials through improved participant selection."
Electronic Lateral Flow Assay Rapidly Detects and Quantifies Multiple Compounds Wirelessly,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/electronic-lateral-flow-assay-rapidly-detects-and-quantifies-multiple-compounds,"Stanford researchers have developed a electrochemical lateral flow assay (eLFA) diagnostics platform that eliminates the instrumentation typically needed to analyze or read point of use tests. Point of use tests are commonly conducted under scenarios where resources are scarce. They are utilized in order to rapidly detect and quantify multiple compounds of interest in biological, chemical and environmental samples. However, instrumentation cost, size and power requirements can severely limit utilization of point of use tests in resource-limited settings. Elimination of the instrumentation typically required to analyze or read point of use tests would enable modern diagnostics technologies to be employed more widely. This would provide users with real-time, actionable health and/or environmental information. Therefore to address the limitation of instrumentation, Stanford researchers developed a electrochemical lateral flow assay diagnostics platform that eliminates the need for expensive analyzers or reader instrumentation typically required for quantitative tests. Instead the eLFA communicates the presence or abundance of compounds of interest to a user wirelessly via a cell phone app. This advanced eLFA technology platform presents commercial opportunities as it is compatible with the two most widely utilized molecular diagnostics test formats, sandwich assays and competition assays. Stage of development Prototype Applications include Tests that can identify and wirelessly communicate the presence or abundance of:  Infectious disease antigens or antibodies in biological samples Human and veterinary health and wellness biomarkers in biological samples and/or chemical irritants or toxins in environmental samples Adulterants or impurities in foods, chemicals and pharmaceuticals  , Infectious disease antigens or antibodies in biological samples, Human and veterinary health and wellness biomarkers in biological samples and/or chemical irritants or toxins in environmental samples, Adulterants or impurities in foods, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Advantages of the device are Accurate and low-cost, Eliminates the need of traditional test reader instrumentation., Capability to measure multiple biomarkers simultaneously, Powered wirelessly."
Additive manufacturing of iron components for magnetic shielding,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/additive-manufacturing-iron-components-magnetic-shielding,"Researchers in the Gu Research Group and SUPER lab have developed an additive manufacturing method for making iron-based magnetic shielding coatings and components by controlling the geometry of the iron, leading to significantly better performance.  Magnetic shielding protects vulnerable devices used in automotives, aerospace and aviation, telecommunications, data storage, medical imaging equipment, high precision instruments, and more.  Permeability, magnetic saturation, thermal stability, and operating frequency range determine magnetic shield effectiveness. Iron has excellent magnetic saturation and thermal stability, but can only be used in the frequency range of 100 Hz due to eddy current losses. Fe-Si and other soft metal alloys are typically used, which are expensive and difficult to process. The Stanford researchers' additive manufacturing (AM) method leverages space-filling curves to increase the iron components frequency range three orders of magnitude to above 1 kHz, without affecting iron's saturation, permeability, or thermal stability.  The process is easier, faster, and less expensive than industry standards, and resulting prototypes meet or outperform industry standard devices made from more resistive nanocrystalline and amorphous compositions, and laminate devices made from electrical steel. (See graph)  In addition, the AM shield shape can conform closely to the shape of the component it is shielding, and other high-saturation and high temperature shielding materials may be used, such as FeNi and FeCo alloys. Stage of Development – Proof of Concept Topology optimization is ongoing for iron, other magnetic metallic alloys (FeNi and FeCo), and amorphous metals to increase their cut-off frequency to the MHz regime to compete with ferrites and Iron/Polymer composites.   Additively manufactured, space-filling curve prototype Hilbert structures with an inset of the CAD model including a comparison of the order 4 and order 5 cross-sections. (Image Courtesy the Gu Group and SUPER Lab)  Benchmark comparison of topology optimized additively manufactured components (o4, o5) vs. solid and laminated components (Image Courtesy the Gu Group and SUPER Lab) Applications include Custom magnetic shielding for: , Medical Devices and Medical Imaging Equipment, Electronics and Magnetic Storage Media, High-Precision Instruments (e.g. electron microscopes, etc), Automotive, Aerospace and Aviation, Telecommunications. Advantages of the device are Faster, easier processing at lower cost  - No need for complex stacking laminations. After printing, components can be cut off the substrate with no further processing before the device assembly., Custom design fabrication (via additive manufacturing) tailored to a particular application, Superior performance."
Baseband Quantum Networks for Superconducting Circuits,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/baseband-quantum-networks-superconducting-circuits,"Stanford researchers have developed an approach to enable larger superconducting quantum systems that can likely span several refrigerators, necessitating connecting qubits across refrigerators efficiently. Current connectors are limited in its scalability. Superconducting coaxial cables have not been seriously considered for connecting qubits in neighboring dilution refrigerators because they lose quantum information too quickly at typical superconducting qubit frequencies (approximately 2-8 GHz). However, it is known that such cables are extremely low loss at low frequencies when the wavelength of light is comparable to the fridge-to-fridge separation. This invention enables qubits to be strongly coupled to the low-frequency modes of superconducting coaxial cables using a circuit that transduces quantum information from typical qubit frequencies down to a lower frequency, the so-called baseband, where the tradeoff between frequency-dependent loss and thermal fluctuations is optimized. Stage of Development Applications include Quantum computing data centers,  where computational tasks can be distributed over superconducting quantum processors in different dilution refrigerators, End user will be researchers and industry  seeking to run larger quantum simulations or solve larger optimization problems not currently possible with current computation capabilities. Advantages of the device are Scalable, Improves the accuracy and capacity of the quantum channel,   especially using frequencies around 200 MHz instead of 8 GHz, Enables many hundreds of times increase in transmission rates,  especially in contrast to other approaches, i.e. using optical photons, or microwave photons through waveguides."
Ultrasound Heat Therapy Device for Preventing Perineal Tears During Labor and Delivery,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/ultrasound-heat-therapy-device-preventing-perineal-tears-during-labor-and-delivery,"Of the 1.4 million first time mothers giving vaginal birth in the United States, approximately 75% will experience tearing of their vagina or perineum. During labor, the pelvic floor stretches to accommodate fetal passage, and overstretching of this relatively inelastic tissue can result in tearing and permanent injury. Up to 7% of mothers will experience the most severe form of tears, where the laceration extends from the vaginal opening all the way to the anus and rectum, damaging the underlying tissues. These severe injuries require comprehensive repair, and put patients at increased risk of post-partum complications such as infections, wound dehiscence, and pain. Patients with severe tears are also more likely to experience long term sequelae of their injuries including incontinence, prolapse, and dyspareunia. These result in ongoing follow-up visits, out of pocket costs, and in some cases additional surgical procedures. The prevention of perineal trauma during childbirth remains a significant concern for maternal health. Evidence suggests that applying heat to the perineal area can potentially reduce the risk of trauma by increasing tissue elasticity and blood flow. However, current methods for delivering this heat, such as conductive heating pads or compresses, present challenges in achieving safe and effective temperatures. Conductive heat can easily lead to burns, especially in the sensitive perineal region of patients that are often under anesthesia. Most available equipment is not designed to provide the consistent, controlled heat necessary to induce beneficial changes at the tissue level. The development of an ultrasound-based heating device specifically for the perineum offers a promising solution to these challenges. By using ultrasound technology, heat can be applied more precisely and safely, reducing the risk of burns while delivering the optimal temperature needed to increase tissue elasticity and potentially lower the risk of perineal tears. This approach combines both safety and effectiveness, addressing the usability gaps in current heating methods and providing a novel intervention for childbirth-related perineal trauma prevention. Inventors at Stanford have developed a handheld therapeutic device that uses ultrasound energy to heat the tissues of the perineum. The device consists of a reusable ultrasound unit with a single use disposable gel pad which will be exchanged between patients and can be easily replaced if soiled. The energy from the device improves pelvic floor elasticity by 1) changing the viscoelastic properties of the underlying tissue at a precisely controlled depth, 2) stimulating blood flow to improve tissue's resistance to tearing, and 3) inhibiting neural pathways that lead to over-contraction of the pelvic muscles during the delivery. The device provides a low-cost therapeutic solution that ensures sterility, patient comfort, and ease of use at the bedside. Stage of Development Proof of Concept - The device is at the proof-of-concept stage. Existing literature supports the efficacy of heat in reducing perineal trauma, and we have successfully demonstrated that our ultrasound technology can safely heat tissues at the required depth without causing burns. This establishes a strong foundation for the device's potential in preventing perineal tears during childbirth. Further development is focused on optimizing the device for clinical use. Applications include Perineal trauma, Maternal health, OB/GYN, Labor and Delivery, Medical device, Therapeutic ultrasound. Advantages of the device are No existing commercial solutions aimed at reducing perineal tears during delivery, Precise control of heat delivery: precision targeting and controlled temperature that ensures an optimal temperature at deeper tissues without overheating the skin, Non-invasive and safe, Portable and user-friendly design."
Using gene therapy and metabolite supplementation to treat ciliopathies,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/using-gene-therapy-and-metabolite-supplementation-treat-ciliopathies,"Stanford scientists have discovered that novel gene therapy and metabolite supplementation approaches show promise in treating ciliopathies. These potential breakthroughs could significantly impact patients, as there are currently no approved treatments for any ciliopathy condition. Ciliopathies are genetic disorders affecting multiple organ systems and reducing life expectancy. Joubert syndrome, a rare form of ciliopathy, is characterized by midbrain defects, ocular motor apraxia, and developmental delays. At least 35 genes critical for cilia function have been identified in these disorders. Ciliopathies can lead to renal failure, progressive blindness, and other severe complications. Despite the identification of key genes like ARMC9 and the significant impact on patients' quality of life, there are currently no approved treatments for any ciliopathy condition, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. Gene therapy and metabolite supplementation resulted in a rescue of cilia formation in Joubert Syndrome patient cells. Importantly, these treatments rescued cellular defects and cilia deficiency in vivo and in cellular models. Consequently, gene therapy and metabolite supplementation have the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and transform the treatment landscape for ciliopathies by addressing the fundamental cellular and molecular defects underlying these disorders. Stage of Development Preclinical - in vivo Continued research - continuing with future applications for NIH funding Applications include Treatment of ciliopathies, including Joubert Syndrome, Addressing cellular defects and cilia formation in genetic disorders, Potential therapy for multiple organ systems affected by ciliopathies. Advantages of the device are Gene therapy rescues cilia formation in Joubert Syndrome patients, Metabolite supplementation restores cellular defects and cilia deficiency in vivo and in cells, Versatile approaches that can potentially address multiple ciliopathy manifestations."
Using exosomes as biomarkers for non-invasive brain tumor detection,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/using-exosomes-biomarkers-non-invasive-brain-tumor-detection,"Stanford scientists have developed a device to distinguish the molecule-specific signatures of diseased exosomes isolated from glioblastoma patients. The device is portable, disposable, and low-cost, enabling point-of-care assessment of disease. Classifying exosomes from patient plasma can be used as a diagnostic for rapid, sensitive, and non-invasive diagnoses of brain cancers. Glioblastoma detection poses significant challenges due to its complex nature and similarity to other brain lesions. Current diagnostic methods, primarily relying on MRI and biopsy, are limited in their ability to accurately distinguish glioblastoma from other conditions or detect early recurrence. The heterogeneity of glioblastoma further complicates diagnosis, requiring extensive molecular and histopathological analysis as per WHO guidelines. These methods are often costly, time-consuming, and not universally accessible. With a median survival of less than 15 months and a 90% recurrence rate, there is an urgent need for more efficient and accurate detection methods. Developing a rapid, cost-effective, and non-invasive screening tool could substantially enhance glioblastoma diagnosis, enabling earlier detection, more precise tumor margin identification, and improved differentiation from treatment-related changes. Consequently, a molecule-specific non-invasive tool that can provide comprehensive diagnostic information is essential to address these clinical challenges and improve patient outcomes.

Predictive Biomarker for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Recurrence,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/predictive-biomarker-hepatocellular-carcinoma-hcc-recurrence,"Stanford researchers have developed a predictive biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence post-treatment that provides key spatial distribution information about cell interaction. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common form of liver cancer and has poor five-year survival rates of below 20%. Early-stage HCC patients often undergo surgery to remove damaged livers as a means of disease intervention. However, the effectiveness of surgery is often counteracted by high recurrence rates, which can range from 50-70%. To reduce high recurrence, adjuvant therapies can be used in the clinic, yet these therapies cause severe adverse events in more than a third of the patients. One of the primary challenges of combating early recurrence is identifying reliable biomarkers to help predict patients who are most likely to experience HCC recurrence after treatments like surgery or chemoembolization. Prior biomarkers for HCC, such as gene signatures or protein expression, are limited in their ability to provide information about the spatial distribution of cells or how cancer and immune cells interact with each other. To address this gap Stanford researchers developed a novel spatial signature/ biomarker capable of identifying patients at high risk of recurrence with high accuracy. This predictive capability could enhance patient outcomes by making more informed selection of patients for risky adjuvant therapies, as well as enabling more tailored post-operative treatment plans. The technology is also designed to work with standard histology samples, making it easily integrable into current clinical and commercial workflows without the need for specialized equipment or processes. Stage of research In vivo data Applications include Predictive diagnostic tool for liver cancer, Identifying patients who need adjuvant therapy, Personalized medicine & patient management (aid more effective post-surgical treatment decisions), Monitoring and managing HCC recurrence. Advantages of the device are Incorporates complex spatial contexts of cellular interactions., More accurate prediction of disease progression., Easily integrable into current clinical workflows.."
A general method for large-scale alignment of cellular and molecular properties measured in live beings and postmortem on the same biological sample,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/general-method-large-scale-alignment-cellular-and-molecular-properties-measured-live,"Typically, cell live imaging and cell molecular profiling are performed on two different samples without the direct observation of two modalities of information on the exact same cells. The main challenge lies in tissue distortions and loss of spatial information during sample processing, such as slicing or chemical treatments. Stanford researchers have developed a solution to track the spatial coordinates of the sample throughout the process. By maintaining a coordinated reference system and correcting for distortions, the method allows researchers to map molecular profiles back to the same cells that were observed in vivo. This approach offers a new level of precision in studying organs like the brain, liver, or kidney, where understanding both cellular function and molecular properties is critical. Stage of Development  In vivo: studies in neurons in the mouse brain Applications include Aligning of in vivo cell imaging and ex vivo structural molecular profiling of the same cells, Research in:  Neuroscience, cancer, clinical diagnostics, drug development, immunotherapy. Advantages of the device are Large-scale alignment, Precise, Economical, Reliable, Only such method in the market."
Deep Learning Enabled Hybrid CT-MRI with Highly Sparse Sensory Data,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/deep-learning-enabled-hybrid-ct-mri-highly-sparse-sensory-data,"Among the many medical imaging modalities, CT and MRI scans are utilized most often for imaging bone and soft tissue respectively. As such, physicians often require both images to fully diagnose patients and determine treatment plans. To better harness these advantages, this work has developed a deep-learning model for creating hybrid CT-MRI images from highly sparse sensory data. The key component of this technology utilizes the assumption that each hybrid, CT, and MRI image can be reconstructed from a shared latent feature space. Therefore, the training set only requires a mini-batch of CT and MRI images each which is fed into the cross-modal auto encoder framework. Preliminary testing has shown that analytic reconstruction of just the CT or MRI images show large streak artifacts due to under-sampled data, but the hybrid image has high similarity with the true images. The degree of fusion between CT and MRI can also be tuned using a fusion hyperparameter allowing physicians to create the most useful image. Stage of Research Applications include Treatment planning for radiation therapy, Hybrid image guided interventions (e.g., radiation therapy or surgery), Effectively fuse different modality images: low-dose CT and fast MRI reconstruction. Advantages of the device are Higher image quality for improved diagnostics and image guidance: hybrid images preserve high bone contrast and clear soft tissue dynamic range, Creation of MRI image from CT sensory data, and vice vera., Reduced human intervention in regularization term design."
Design of Universal H5 Influenza virus vaccine candidates via Antigen Reorientation,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/design-universal-h5-influenza-virus-vaccine-candidates-antigen-reorientation,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed novel universal vaccine candidates for H5 influenza viruses. Influenza remains a serious threat to public health. H5 avian influenza strains are among the most concerning despite lack of documented human to human transmission due to their high mortality rates (40-60%). Currently available vaccines are unlikely to confer significant immunity to H5. Additionally, a large portion of public health resources every year are expended to create a seasonal vaccine for influenza viral strains that are circulating in the general population. Taken together, these facts point towards the urgent unmet need for a universal influenza vaccine. Stage of Development Research - in vivo Stage of Research The inventors have created novel vaccine candidates for H5 influenza viruses. Specifically, the immune response to these vaccine candidates is directed towards specific epitopes that are conserved across strains and are less mutable than epitopes that are traditionally exposed. A modified H5 HA antigen is presented in a defined orientation via electrostatic interactions with the adjuvant such that specific epitopes are exposed and the immune response is therefore directed towards those exposed epitopes. This in turn will confer immunity to a larger breadth of viral variants. Experiments in mice with these vaccine candidates have shown that these vaccine candidates generate broad immunity to a number of influenza strains. Applications include Vaccine candidates for H5 avian influeza, Vaccine candidates for a breadth of influenza viruses. Advantages of the device are Generates broad immunity to a number of influenza viral strains via exposure of a conserved epitope."
Selective sensitization of cancer cells to elimination by cytotoxic lymphocytes,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/selective-sensitization-cancer-cells-elimination-cytotoxic-lymphocytes,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed a novel method for the treatment and prevention of cancer. The immune system is an integral part of the human body's response to outside threats, including cancer. Specifically, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells have been shown to selectively seek and eliminate cancer cells. However, cancer cells have evolved several ways to evade this immune response, including downregulating receptors, altering tumor associated antigens, and changing the tumor microenvironment. High throughput genetic knockdown and knockout screens have been highly effective in identifying key genetic drivers of these mechanisms. However, these screens are most likely to identify factors that are necessary but not sufficient for a response. A need exists for new methods in identifying and isolating novel regulators of the cancer immune interface. Stage of Research The inventors have developed a method by which cancer cells are able to be specifically sensitized to enhance their elimination by cytotoxic lymphocytes. Specifically, the inventors performed a screen to identify factors which make cancer cells more susceptible to killing by CD8+ T cells. These targets were then overexpressed, individually or in combination, in cancer cells in order to sensitize them to cytotoxic lymphocyte killing. Targets for this sensitization also include ligands that can act in a paracrine signalling mechanism to induce cytotoxic killing activity in engineered lymphocytes. Taken together, this invention comprises a promising therapeutic avenue for the treatment and prevention of cancer. Stage of Development Research - in vitro Applications include Production of sensitized cancer cells and engineered cytotoxic lymphocytes, Novel therapeutic avenue for the treatment and/or prevention of cancer. Advantages of the device are Targets are more likely to be necessary and sufficient to produce significant anti-cancer effects."
Compositions and methods for re-activation of dysfunctional skeletal stem cells,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/compositions-and-methods-re-activation-dysfunctional-skeletal-stem-cells,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed a novel therapeutic avenue for the treatment of osteoporosis and other musculoskeletal diseases. Musculoskeletal disease incidence rates have increased in recent years in response to an aging population. Available therapies for osteoporosis-related bone loss are effective but come with significant side effects. As such, there is a need for novel therapeutic approaches with minimal side effects profiles. In a separate vein, stem cell technologies represent a new frontier in modern medicine. Indeed, human skeletal stem cell (hSSC) dysfunction has been implicated in musculoskeletal diseases, specifically in the context of aging. There remains a major unmet medical need for therapies targeting the re-activation of dysfunctional hSSCs in the context of musculoskeletal diseases. Stage of Development Research - in vivo Stage of Research The inventors have pioneered a novel method for re-activating dysfunctional hSSCs in the context of disease or age related dysfuntion. These researchers found that aged SSCs have lower bone-forming potential due to their a lack of diversity via their skewed lineage trajectory towards fibrostromal tissues. Using a Boolean mathematics approach, they identified two factors that can re-instate youthful SSC activity in dysfunctional diseased or aged SSCs. Specifically, this method involves contacting stem cells with a combination of an inhibitor of bone morphogenic protein (BMP)/transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B) and an activator of Hedgehog (Hh) signalling. Indeed, co-administration of such factors was shown to increase osteogenesis in mice. Applications include Regeneration of bone due to aging and or disease. Advantages of the device are Has the potential to offer a more limited side effect profile than currently available therapies, Can be delivered using biodegradable hydrogels."
Novel small molecule negative allosteric modulators of the mu-opioid receptor,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/novel-small-molecule-negative-allosteric-modulators-mu-opioid-receptor,"Researchers at Stanford University and Washington University in St. Louis have discovered a novel molecular pathway for the treatment of opioid overdose. Opioids are a powerful tool for pain management when used in clinical care settings. However, in recent years these drugs have been misappropriated for recreational use, spurring a public health crisis. In the US alone there were over 80,000 deaths due to opioid overdose in 2022. Naloxone has proven to be a key tool in the fight against opioid overdose by acting as an agonist of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). However, use of naloxone for opioid overdose has drawbacks, including that naloxone requires larger, repeated doses in response to more potent fentanyl. To this end, a need exists for novel negative allosteric modulators of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) that are selective with limited off target effects. Stage of Development Research - in vitro Stage of Research Researchers sought to improve upon their previous finding (compound 368) via structure-based optimization in order to find compounds with enhanced medicinal chemistry properties. Specifically, researchers modified a potentially labile sulfide to an ether to improve its pharmacokinetic properties.  Researchers found that this compound is an allosteric modulator of the MOR in vitro. While this molecule is still a full inhibitor of the MOR, it has a dampened ability to enhance naloxone affinity for the receptor, which in turn makes the molecule less dependent on co-administration with naloxone for activity. Applications include Novel treatment of opioid overdose. Advantages of the device are Potentially less dependent on co-administration with naloxone for therapeutic effects."
