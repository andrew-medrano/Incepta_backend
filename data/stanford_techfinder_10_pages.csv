An Adjustable Mitral Ring for Asymmetric and Continuous Off-Bypass Annulus Reduction                                                                                      ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/adjustable-mitral-ring-asymmetric-and-continuous-bypass-annulus-reduction                ,"Researchers at Stanford University have created a novel mitral valve annuloplasty ring that can be adjusted in size off-bypass in response to regurgitation. Mitral annuloplasty ring implantation is one of the most common mitral valve surgeries to reduce mitral regurgitation by establishing proper leaflet coaptation. Mitral ring sizing is a difficult process whereby a surgeon decides how much to reduce the size of the annulus while the heart is arrested. Methods currently do not exist to adjust the ring size once the heart has been restarted, and small sizing errors often result in persistent regurgitation, which requires the surgeon to re-arrest the heart and re-perform the annuloplasty procedure. To avoid exposing patients to this additional risk, Stanford researchers have developed an annuloplasty ring with a mechanism to adjust its size after the heart has been closed and re-animated. They used custom folding and semiflexible material technologies to enable asymmetric annulus constriction via sutures routed through the ring. The suture-based tightening mechanism exits the left atrium and allows for post-implantation adjustments based on real-time heart function. This invention enables surgeons to address minor sizing errors without extensive reoperation. Figure Applications include Mitral valve annuloplasty. Advantages of the device are Off-bypass adjustability, Reduced surgery time, Improved surgical outcome."
Anatomically conforming device for tricuspid valve annuloplasty                                                                                                           ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/anatomically-conforming-device-tricuspid-valve-annuloplasty                              ,"Stanford researchers have designed a novel tricuspid annuloplasty ring that minimizes the risk of interrupting cardiac conduction during implantation. Tricuspid regurgitation is a prevalent heart condition in which the tricuspid valve fails to close completely during ventricular contraction. The disrupted unidirectional blood flow could lead to abnormal pressure or volume overload. Patients with moderate to severe cases may require annuloplasty, where a ring device is implanted over the annulus around the tricuspid valve to support valve leaflets. While securing the device, sutures often inadvertently cross the bundle of His in the septum, disrupting heart conduction. To avoid this complication, there is a critical need for alternate annuloplasty devices. Researchers in the Woo Lab at Stanford have created a modular annuloplasty device that avoids suture placement in conduction tissue. Its most basic form is a C-shaped band with a wide gap between the two ends to avoid traversing over the septal leaflet. The device can be further secured by adding a flexible polymer that joins the ends of the device. Alternatively, the ends can be conjoined with a bridge-like structure that bends away from the valve. The bridge is angled to conform to the septal wall and aorta, improving retention. Figure Applications include Tricuspid valve annuloplasty. Advantages of the device are No suture placement in conduction tissue, Reduced need for pacemakers, Improved retention strength, Reduced recurrent regurgitation."

With its excellent gain, broadband emission, large bandgap and high power-handling, integrated Titanium-doped Sapphire (Ti:Sapphire) photonics could dramatically change visible and near-IR laser sources.   State of the art manufacturing of integrated Ti:Sapphire technology relies on costly, size limited, highly doped Ti:Sapphire wafers which are limited in size, doping control, and uniformity. Stanford researchers start using a standard, undoped, sapphire substrate, in which a near surface level Titanium source is created via implantation of or deposition. This layer can be patterned via masked implantation, or lithographically deposited. High temperature annealing improves the doping layer quality. The damaged layer is subsequently removed leaving a uniform, clean surface layer of Ti:Sapphire at the top of the sapphire substrate. The surface-doped Ti:Sapphire is then bonded to a substrate, where the doped region lies at the interface. Finally, the undoped sapphire portions of the original material are removed, leaving a wafer-scale thin-film Ti:Sapphire platform.  By leveraging these various deposition, lithography, diffusion and annealing techniques to convert undoped sapphire substrates into surface-doped substrates at wafer scale, Stanford researchers dramatically reduce costs and miniaturize integrated Ti:Sapphire-on-Insulator photonics.

Current solutions for building oligonucleotides suffer from high error rates, low yields as the chains get longer, and high solvent use and waste production. The Stanford device (Figure 1) is inexpensively fabricated using standard PDMS soft lithography mass manufacturing technology.  Multiple integrated microfluidic channels  introduce single droplets of consistent size onto the optoelectronic substrate. The optoelectronics precisely encapsulates and decapsulates individual solid supports (i.e., polystyrene microbeads) with corresponding picoliter volume reagent microdroplets. Complete encapsulation ensures uniform reagent exposure, which reduces errors and improves the final yield rate significantly. In addition, picoliter droplet reactors replace microtiter plates, which reduces reagent consumption and waste generation by up to a million-fold.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted between humans and animals. Viral mutation and zoonotic transfer are anticipated to lead to future pandemics and largescale outbreaks.  Indeed, the COVID-19 respiratory disease likely originated in bats, and led to a pandemic with over 750 million cases and nearly seven million deaths worldwide. To date, there are a limited number of active pharmaceutical agents that are effective at treating COVID-19 or other coronavirus infections in patients. There is therefore an urgent need for therapeutics capable of treating infections arising from known coronaviruses, as well as from new coronaviruses that will arise in the future. For instance, the development of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies was a major advance in the treatment of COVID-19. However, known mAb therapies gradually become ineffective with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Stage of Development Research – in vitro Stage of Research The inventors have developed improved fusion proteins containing an antibody domain, that binds a highly conserved epitope of betacoronavirus Spike proteins on the S2 subunit, and an ACE2 domain, which serves at the neutralizing domain. SARS-CoV-2 variants are less likely to escape the binding of fusion proteins than neutralizing mAbs targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins. Applications include Use as a broad and high-potency therapeutic against coronavirus infections., Fusion protein therapies, which are likely to inhibit any betacoronavirus that uses the highly conserved ACE2 as a receptor, making them suitable for stockpiling in anticipation of the next betacoronavirus jumping from animals to humans., Use in high-risk patients with complex medication regimes.. Advantages of the device are Greater breadth of protection than previously described fusion proteins., The use of fusion proteins with enzymatically inactive ACE2 (the virus' own host receptor), which prevents adverse side effects of administering fusion proteins with active ACE2 domain. These adverse effects stem from the functions of ACE2 in regulating blood pressure and vascular tone., More efficacious in vitro activity than known anti-coronavirus mAbs., Broad neutralizing range that includes all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV-1., Expected to have few, if any, interactions with other medications a patient may be taking.."

Lysosome-targeted degradation is an emerging therapeutic modality that facilitates the degradation of membrane and soluble extracellular proteins. Compared to traditional therapeutic modalities, such as small molecule or antibody-based inhibitors, targeted protein degradation offers increased potential potency and broadens the druggable proteome. These techniques generally use bifunctional molecules to recruit proteins of interest to either lysosome trafficking receptors or plasma membrane-associated ubiquitin ligases. The main drawback of the first generation of this technology, called lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs), is that they contain synthetic glycopeptides that cannot be genetically encoded, thereby limiting cell-mediated delivery applications.

Genotyping is usually used to detect genetic edits; however, it's difficult to track the exact changes made in each individual cell in a large cellular mixture, especially when the cells receive multiple edits. While whole genome genotyping is available to track each cell in a mixture, the technique is expensive and time-consuming. Thus, there is a need for additional methodologies that enables quicker and cost-efficient tracking of genetic edits within cells of interest. The Fraser lab at Stanford has invented a genetic engineering platform that enables multiple cellular gene editing while tracking the exact edits being made. The invention consists of two or more CRISPEY modules covalently produced by the vector, where the combination of edits that will be made across all modules are predetermined. Each module applies edits of interest tagged with unique sequences that can be easily genotyped by DNA sequencing or other methods. When needed, the intended combination of precise edits for each can also be inferred by Sanger sequencing, NGS, or other detection methods.

This technology enables the first wide-field lifetime camera that is compatible with single-molecule microscopy. Existing sensors for wide-field nanosecond imaging (e.g. time-of-flight cameras, SPAD arrays, and gated intensifiers) sacrifice performance and are not compatible with low-light applications in bioimaging and fluorescence microscopy.

Many studies have successfully demonstrated directed differentiation of iPSCs into cardiomyocytes. However, further assembling and maturing the iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to mimic the mechanics of the native heart tissue remains a challenge. To overcome this challenge, studies have created microenvironments resembling that of primary cardiomyocytes during development: micropillar structures were placed to provide a 3D environment and exogenous cues were applied to facilitate anisotropic alignment of cells for coordinated contraction and electrical conduction. The engineered tissue's maturation was improved but still not comparable to the native heart. Researchers at Stanford have devised a platform that provides a more biomimetic microenvironment (Figure 1). Using advanced 3D bioprinting technology, cells were printed with soft silicone in preferred arrangements. The print was placed in an electrically conductive bioreactor that can be actuated to apply torsional force or pneumatic pressure to the silicone to introduce twisting and contractile cardiac mechanics that the micropillar approach neglected to include.

Dysfunctions in this pathway are linked to disorders like peripheral neuropathy and autism spectrum disorder. Despite a significant need for effective therapeutics modulating pain and other somatosensory modalities, clinical translation remains challenging, which is likely related to species-specific features and the lack of in vitro models to directly probe and manipulate this polysynaptic pathway. To remedy this issue, Stanford researchers have developed the first human ascending sensory pathway model using assembloids.

Composition and Method for Autonomous RNA Switches for Translational Control                                                                                              ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/composition-and-method-autonomous-rna-switches-translational-control                     ,"Stanford scientists have discovered that the untranslated region (UTR) of RNA can be engineered into autonomous switches capable of both sensing native biological conditions (e.g. T cell activation) and promptly responding by initiating the translation of a therapeutic sequence (e.g. a chimeric antigen receptor). Autonomous mRNA switches can provide dynamic regulation within cellular immunotherapies and offer broad utility in next-generation mRNA therapeutics, such as engineering chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in vivo. Ex vivo CAR T cell therapy has shown significant success in treating oncology patients and combating malignant tumors. However, this approach is limited by the expensive and time-consuming ex vivo production process, which can take several weeks, and the challenge of administering only a single effective dose to patients, leading to potential tumor relapse. In contrast, in vivo CAR T cell therapy offers a promising solution by directly engineering T cells within patients using mRNA therapeutics. This innovative approach enables rapid and customizable production, with the transient nature of mRNA therapies allowing for precise temporal control of therapeutic doses. Nevertheless, advancements are needed to develop technologies capable of sensing relevant biological conditions and tightly regulating the translation of therapeutic payloads. Novel strategies for controlling mRNA expression in T cells will enable the development of in vivo T cell therapies that can alleviate T cell dysfunction while preserving the protective immune responses required for human health. Novel engineered UTR sequences resulted in RNA elements that can sense T cell signals and modulate therapeutic mRNA expression as ON/OFF switches. These mRNA switches have been shown to induce the translation of genetic payloads upon T-cell activation. The use of these mRNA switches to control the translation of a CAR in engineered T cells resulted in the expression of the CAR and the killing of antigen-positive tumor cells. Importantly, when co-cultured with antigen-negative cells, there was no difference in CAR expression or killing when compared to baseline. Consequently, autonomous mRNA switches have the potential to enhance cellular immunotherapies and enable the development of in vivo CAR T cell therapies. Stage of Development: Preclinical – in vitro data Continued research – in vivo demonstration of efficacy and further description of switches that capture other immune cell states (e.g. T cell exhaustion, NK cell activation, etc.).

Applications include Production of mRNA switches that can sense and respond to native biological conditions (e.g. T cell activation), Synthetic regulation of therapeutic payloads in situ, Engineering of cellular immunotherapies in vivo. Advantages of the device are Precise control of the translation of genetic payloads, Rapid and customizable production of mRNA switches, Flexible temporal control of therapeutic dosing due to the transient nature of mRNA."

The GI tract plays an important role in maintaining overall health, as it is responsible for digesting food, absorbing nutrients, and eliminating waste. Sampling from the GI tract, particularly its mucous layer, is essential in understanding gut health and disease. Bioanalytes from the mucus can provide insights into inflammation, metabolic function, and immune response. Currently, invasive procedures like endoscopy and colonoscopy are used to sample from the GI tract. There is a need for a non-invasive method. Smart pills have recently emerged as non-invasive sampling platforms. However, to date, they have relied on passive diffusion and thus are not suitable for viscous mucus.

Kidney stones are clusters of minerals and salts that form in the urinary tract, potentially causing severe pain from urinary tract obstruction, renal injury, or infections. During ureteroscopy, an endoscope is inserted through the urethra to break up larger stones with lasers or ultrasound. Fragments are either retrieved or, if small, allowed to pass naturally. Unfortunately, residual fragments and dust often cause recurrent symptomatic obstruction and stone regrowth. Therefore, there is a critical need for a more efficient clearance method. In response, vacuum-assisted sheaths have been recently introduced. However, they remove renal fluid along with the debris, necessitating fluid infusion to sustain the renal pressure. Stanford researchers at the Zhao Lab have designed a safer and more efficient kidney stone fragments and dusts extraction device that can be used together with kidney stone breaking devices. Their device is based on rotation to manipulate the flow and create a vortex that provides a localized suction towards the device to capture the stone fragments and dusts in the device. Unlike the vacuum-assisted device, this device avoids the risk of collapsing the kidney due to irregularly reduced intrarenal pressure. Stage of Development Proof of concept – in vitro data Applications include Kidney stone removal.

This innovative technology, capable of metabolizing CO2 at low, atmospheric concentrations, offers a promising approach to large-scale carbon sequestration, potentially contributing to global efforts to remove tens of gigatons of carbon dioxide annually by 2030. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a primary contributor to global warming, with atmospheric concentrations steadily increasing due to human activities. Traditional CO2 capture methods often require energy-intensive processes to concentrate and convert the gas, and there are limited end uses for CO2, reducing incentive for CO2 capture and limiting the large-scale applicability. Biological systems, particularly CO2-respiring microbes, offer a promising alternative due to their ability to metabolize CO2 at low concentrations and ambient conditions. Unlike energy-intensive chemical processes, these commonly anaerobic microorganisms can directly capture and convert dilute CO2 into useful organic compounds, operating efficiently in moderately alkaline solutions at ambient temperatures and pressures. Understanding the mechanisms of microbial CO2 metabolism and the conditions that facilitate it could lead to the development of efficient, large-scale carbon capture and conversion technologies. Preliminary experiments with the microbial CO2 capture and conversion system demonstrated successful production of reduced carbon compounds from indoor air. Importantly, the system consumed CO2 to levels below average atmospheric concentrations at sea level, indicating effective carbon sequestration. These results suggest that the microbial technology is capable of both capturing and converting dilute atmospheric CO2. Consequently, this approach has the potential to significantly contribute to global carbon sequestration efforts and transform climate change mitigation strategies by offering a sustainable method to remove CO2 from the atmosphere while producing valuable organic compounds.

This approach offers a new method for ABI measurements, particularly useful for patients with non-compressible arteries, such as those with diabetes. By analyzing Doppler sounds, AutoABI provides a straightforward way to assess peripheral artery disease (PAD) risk without traditional blood pressure cuffs. The system could improve the accessibility and efficiency of PAD diagnosis in point-of-care settings, where quick and accurate assessments are valuable. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a crucial diagnostic tool for peripheral artery disease (PAD), but current measurement methods face significant limitations. Traditional ABI assessment requires inflating a blood pressure cuff while using Doppler ultrasound to measure blood flow in the tibial arteries. However, this technique proves unreliable in patients with non-compressible arteries, a common condition in diabetics with PAD. These patients often have medial arterial calcification, leading to falsely elevated and unreliable ABI readings. The prevalence of diabetes and the increasing need for accurate PAD diagnosis underscores the importance of developing more versatile, point-of-care ABI measurement techniques. An improved method that can provide reliable ABI estimates without relying on blood pressure cuffs could significantly enhance PAD diagnosis and management, particularly in challenging patient populations. AutoABI, a deep learning system integrated into a hand-held Doppler device, successfully predicts ankle-brachial index (ABI) directly from audible Doppler sounds without the need for blood pressure cuffs. This innovative approach enables ABI measurements in patients with non-compressible arteries, a common issue in diabetics with PAD.

They frequently invade a region of the brain called the subventricular zone (SVZ) and this spread correlates with decreased survival. Currently the only therapeutic approach to limit spreading into the SVZ is not optimal as it involves irradiation of the SVZ, which can cause very serious side effects. Thus, new targeted therapeutic strategies are needed. The inventors have determined that SVZ invasion is promoted by the secretion of pleiotrophin, which forms a complex with a group of proteins that acts as a chemoattractant for the glioma to the SVZ. Therapeutic agents that inhibit this chemoattractant complex, such as inhibitory nucleic acids, thus provide a strategy for treating HGGs. This technology provides potential new targets for drug development to limit the spread of deadly brain cancers. Figure Applications include Drug development- new targets for development of therapeutics to treat gliomas, Inhibitory nucleic acids (shRNA, siRNA, miRNA, ASOs) to treat HGG spread. Advantages of the device are Unmet medical need- existing therapeutic strategy is non-optimal, Provides new targets for therapeutic development."
An automated tool for vascular and perivascular segmentation of brain MRI data to identify the risk of dementia and accelerated brain atrophy                             ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/automated-tool-vascular-and-perivascular-segmentation-brain-mri-data-identify-risk       ,"Stanford scientists have developed PVSeg, a tool that automatically segments vascular and perivascular compartments in brain MRI data. This innovative tool can identify non-demented individuals at increased risk of developing dementia and accelerated brain atrophy. PVSeg's metrics could serve as a screening tool, allowing early diagnosis of brain microvascular issues and potentially improving patient treatments and outcomes. Additionally, it could enrich clinical trials for treatments targeting cognitive decline by identifying suitable candidates at increased risk of future cognitive impairment, thereby reducing subject enrollment challenges and decreasing costs. Moreover, in clinical trials specifically targeting Alzheimer's disease pathology (amyloid-β and tau), PVSeg's metrics can refine the selection of participants with a ""purer"" form of preclinical Alzheimer's disease by identifying and screening out individuals with radiographic signs of vascular damage, improving efficiency and effectiveness of clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. Finally, PVSeg's metrics are suitable for longitudinal assessments, allowing the evaluation of treatment effects on the brain vasculature in-vivo. Cerebral small vessel disease is a significant contributor to cognitive decline and dementia. Currently, clinicians use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect signs of vascular damage in the brain, such as white matter hyperintensities and microbleeds. However, these markers are often subtle in healthy individuals and lack quantitative precision. Recent advancements allow for the measurement of brain vasculature and perivascular spaces using standard T1-weighted MRI scans. Yet, current techniques have notable limitations: they are user-dependent, leading to potential inconsistencies, and lack inter-scanner reproducibility. These drawbacks hinder the execution of large-scale, longitudinal studies and clinical trials crucial for understanding the relationship between vascular changes and cognitive impairment over time. There is a clear need for a more robust, automated method to quantify cerebral vascular structures consistently across different MRI machines and over extended periods. A novel, fully automated algorithm has been developed to assess perivascular diameter and count of blood vessels with MRI-visible perivascular space in white matter and basal ganglia using standard 3D T1-weighted MRI scans. PVSeg demonstrates excellent inter-scanner and test-retest reproducibility, addressing key limitations of current methods. Importantly, the algorithm revealed significant associations between vascular metrics and dementia risk, as well as brain atrophy rates, in a large-scale study (>10,000 subjects). By enabling more efficient screening in clinical trials, PVSeg has the potential to substantially reduce required participant numbers and to refine their selection, thereby increasing trial power and reducing costs in dementia research. Stage of Development:  Applications include Assessment of cerebral small vessel disease and its relation to cognitive decline, Early detection of individuals at high risk for dementia, Enrichment of clinical trials for cognitive impairment and dementia, Evaluation of treatment effects on brain vasculature in-vivo. Advantages of the device are Fully automated segmentation of vascular and perivascular compartments in brain MRI, Excellent inter-scanner reproducibility and test-retest repeatability, Robust performance in longitudinal studies, Requires only standard T1-weighted MRI sequences, enabling widespread use, Potential for significant cost reduction in clinical trials through improved participant selection."

Point of use tests are commonly conducted under scenarios where resources are scarce. They are utilized in order to rapidly detect and quantify multiple compounds of interest in biological, chemical and environmental samples. However, instrumentation cost, size and power requirements can severely limit utilization of point of use tests in resource-limited settings. Elimination of the instrumentation typically required to analyze or read point of use tests would enable modern diagnostics technologies to be employed more widely. This would provide users with real-time, actionable health and/or environmental information.

Additive manufacturing of iron components for magnetic shielding                                                                                                          ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/additive-manufacturing-iron-components-magnetic-shielding                                ,"Researchers in the Gu Research Group and SUPER lab have developed an additive manufacturing method for making iron-based magnetic shielding coatings and components by controlling the geometry of the iron, leading to significantly better performance.  Magnetic shielding protects vulnerable devices used in automotives, aerospace and aviation, telecommunications, data storage, medical imaging equipment, high precision instruments, and more.  Permeability, magnetic saturation, thermal stability, and operating frequency range determine magnetic shield effectiveness. Iron has excellent magnetic saturation and thermal stability, but can only be used in the frequency range of 100 Hz due to eddy current losses. Fe-Si and other soft metal alloys are typically used, which are expensive and difficult to process. The Stanford researchers' additive manufacturing (AM) method leverages space-filling curves to increase the iron components frequency range three orders of magnitude to above 1 kHz, without affecting iron's saturation, permeability, or thermal stability.  The process is easier, faster, and less expensive than industry standards, and resulting prototypes meet or outperform industry standard devices made from more resistive nanocrystalline and amorphous compositions, and laminate devices made from electrical steel. (See graph)  In addition, the AM shield shape can conform closely to the shape of the component it is shielding, and other high-saturation and high temperature shielding materials may be used, such as FeNi and FeCo alloys. Stage of Development – Proof of Concept Topology optimization is ongoing for iron, other magnetic metallic alloys (FeNi and FeCo), and amorphous metals to increase their cut-off frequency to the MHz regime to compete with ferrites and Iron/Polymer composites.

Current connectors are limited in its scalability. Superconducting coaxial cables have not been seriously considered for connecting qubits in neighboring dilution refrigerators because they lose quantum information too quickly at typical superconducting qubit frequencies (approximately 2-8 GHz). However, it is known that such cables are extremely low loss at low frequencies when the wavelength of light is comparable to the fridge-to-fridge separation. This invention enables qubits to be strongly coupled to the low-frequency modes of superconducting coaxial cables using a circuit that transduces quantum information from typical qubit frequencies down to a lower frequency, the so-called baseband, where the tradeoff between frequency-dependent loss and thermal fluctuations is optimized. Stage of Development Applications include Quantum computing data centers,  where computational tasks can be distributed over superconducting quantum processors in different dilution refrigerators, End user will be researchers and industry  seeking to run larger quantum simulations or solve larger optimization problems not currently possible with current computation capabilities. Advantages of the device are Scalable, Improves the accuracy and capacity of the quantum channel,   especially using frequencies around 200 MHz instead of 8 GHz, Enables many hundreds of times increase in transmission rates,  especially in contrast to other approaches, i.e. using optical photons, or microwave photons through waveguides."
Ultrasound Heat Therapy Device for Preventing Perineal Tears During Labor and Delivery                                                                                    ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/ultrasound-heat-therapy-device-preventing-perineal-tears-during-labor-and-delivery       ,"Of the 1.4 million first time mothers giving vaginal birth in the United States, approximately 75% will experience tearing of their vagina or perineum. During labor, the pelvic floor stretches to accommodate fetal passage, and overstretching of this relatively inelastic tissue can result in tearing and permanent injury. Up to 7% of mothers will experience the most severe form of tears, where the laceration extends from the vaginal opening all the way to the anus and rectum, damaging the underlying tissues. These severe injuries require comprehensive repair, and put patients at increased risk of post-partum complications such as infections, wound dehiscence, and pain. Patients with severe tears are also more likely to experience long term sequelae of their injuries including incontinence, prolapse, and dyspareunia. These result in ongoing follow-up visits, out of pocket costs, and in some cases additional surgical procedures. The prevention of perineal trauma during childbirth remains a significant concern for maternal health. Evidence suggests that applying heat to the perineal area can potentially reduce the risk of trauma by increasing tissue elasticity and blood flow. However, current methods for delivering this heat, such as conductive heating pads or compresses, present challenges in achieving safe and effective temperatures. Conductive heat can easily lead to burns, especially in the sensitive perineal region of patients that are often under anesthesia. Most available equipment is not designed to provide the consistent, controlled heat necessary to induce beneficial changes at the tissue level. The development of an ultrasound-based heating device specifically for the perineum offers a promising solution to these challenges. By using ultrasound technology, heat can be applied more precisely and safely, reducing the risk of burns while delivering the optimal temperature needed to increase tissue elasticity and potentially lower the risk of perineal tears. This approach combines both safety and effectiveness, addressing the usability gaps in current heating methods and providing a novel intervention for childbirth-related perineal trauma prevention. Inventors at Stanford have developed a handheld therapeutic device that uses ultrasound energy to heat the tissues of the perineum. The device consists of a reusable ultrasound unit with a single use disposable gel pad which will be exchanged between patients and can be easily replaced if soiled. The energy from the device improves pelvic floor elasticity by 1) changing the viscoelastic properties of the underlying tissue at a precisely controlled depth, 2) stimulating blood flow to improve tissue's resistance to tearing, and 3) inhibiting neural pathways that lead to over-contraction of the pelvic muscles during the delivery. The device provides a low-cost therapeutic solution that ensures sterility, patient comfort, and ease of use at the bedside. Stage of Development Proof of Concept - The device is at the proof-of-concept stage. Existing literature supports the efficacy of heat in reducing perineal trauma, and we have successfully demonstrated that our ultrasound technology can safely heat tissues at the required depth without causing burns. This establishes a strong foundation for the device's potential in preventing perineal tears during childbirth. Further development is focused on optimizing the device for clinical use. Applications include Perineal trauma, Maternal health, OB/GYN, Labor and Delivery, Medical device, Therapeutic ultrasound. Advantages of the device are No existing commercial solutions aimed at reducing perineal tears during delivery, Precise control of heat delivery: precision targeting and controlled temperature that ensures an optimal temperature at deeper tissues without overheating the skin, Non-invasive and safe, Portable and user-friendly design."

These potential breakthroughs could significantly impact patients, as there are currently no approved treatments for any ciliopathy condition. Ciliopathies are genetic disorders affecting multiple organ systems and reducing life expectancy. Joubert syndrome, a rare form of ciliopathy, is characterized by midbrain defects, ocular motor apraxia, and developmental delays. At least 35 genes critical for cilia function have been identified in these disorders. Ciliopathies can lead to renal failure, progressive blindness, and other severe complications. Despite the identification of key genes like ARMC9 and the significant impact on patients' quality of life, there are currently no approved treatments for any ciliopathy condition, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. Gene therapy and metabolite supplementation resulted in a rescue of cilia formation in Joubert Syndrome patient cells. Importantly, these treatments rescued cellular defects and cilia deficiency in vivo and in cellular models. Consequently, gene therapy and metabolite supplementation have the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and transform the treatment landscape for ciliopathies by addressing the fundamental cellular and molecular defects underlying these disorders. Stage of Development Preclinical - in vivo Continued research - continuing with future applications for NIH funding Applications include Treatment of ciliopathies, including Joubert Syndrome, Addressing cellular defects and cilia formation in genetic disorders, Potential therapy for multiple organ systems affected by ciliopathies.

Using exosomes as biomarkers for non-invasive brain tumor detection                                                                                                       ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/using-exosomes-biomarkers-non-invasive-brain-tumor-detection                             ,"Stanford scientists have developed a device to distinguish the molecule-specific signatures of diseased exosomes isolated from glioblastoma patients. The device is portable, disposable, and low-cost, enabling point-of-care assessment of disease. Classifying exosomes from patient plasma can be used as a diagnostic for rapid, sensitive, and non-invasive diagnoses of brain cancers. Glioblastoma detection poses significant challenges due to its complex nature and similarity to other brain lesions. Current diagnostic methods, primarily relying on MRI and biopsy, are limited in their ability to accurately distinguish glioblastoma from other conditions or detect early recurrence. The heterogeneity of glioblastoma further complicates diagnosis, requiring extensive molecular and histopathological analysis as per WHO guidelines. These methods are often costly, time-consuming, and not universally accessible. With a median survival of less than 15 months and a 90% recurrence rate, there is an urgent need for more efficient and accurate detection methods. Developing a rapid, cost-effective, and non-invasive screening tool could substantially enhance glioblastoma diagnosis, enabling earlier detection, more precise tumor margin identification, and improved differentiation from treatment-related changes. Consequently, a molecule-specific non-invasive tool that can provide comprehensive diagnostic information is essential to address these clinical challenges and improve patient outcomes. Using Surface Enhanced Raman spectroscopy (Glio-SERS) and machine learning to classify exosomes resulted in high specificity and sensitivity in glioblastoma identification. Importantly, Glio-SERS is capable of differentiating between glioblastoma and other brain lesions with high accuracy. Consequently, Glio-SERS has the potential to drastically improve glioblastoma detection and transform the brain cancer field by providing a rapid, sensitive, and non-invasive diagnostic for glioblastoma patients.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common form of liver cancer and has poor five-year survival rates of below 20%. Early-stage HCC patients often undergo surgery to remove damaged livers as a means of disease intervention. However, the effectiveness of surgery is often counteracted by high recurrence rates, which can range from 50-70%. To reduce high recurrence, adjuvant therapies can be used in the clinic, yet these therapies cause severe adverse events in more than a third of the patients. One of the primary challenges of combating early recurrence is identifying reliable biomarkers to help predict patients who are most likely to experience HCC recurrence after treatments like surgery or chemoembolization. Prior biomarkers for HCC, such as gene signatures or protein expression, are limited in their ability to provide information about the spatial distribution of cells or how cancer and immune cells interact with each other. To address this gap Stanford researchers developed a novel spatial signature/ biomarker capable of identifying patients at high risk of recurrence with high accuracy. This predictive capability could enhance patient outcomes by making more informed selection of patients for risky adjuvant therapies, as well as enabling more tailored post-operative treatment plans. The technology is also designed to work with standard histology samples, making it easily integrable into current clinical and commercial workflows without the need for specialized equipment or processes. Stage of research In vivo data Applications include Predictive diagnostic tool for liver cancer, Identifying patients who need adjuvant therapy, Personalized medicine & patient management (aid more effective post-surgical treatment decisions), Monitoring and managing HCC recurrence.

As such, physicians often require both images to fully diagnose patients and determine treatment plans. To better harness these advantages, this work has developed a deep-learning model for creating hybrid CT-MRI images from highly sparse sensory data. The key component of this technology utilizes the assumption that each hybrid, CT, and MRI image can be reconstructed from a shared latent feature space. Therefore, the training set only requires a mini-batch of CT and MRI images each which is fed into the cross-modal auto encoder framework. Preliminary testing has shown that analytic reconstruction of just the CT or MRI images show large streak artifacts due to under-sampled data, but the hybrid image has high similarity with the true images. The degree of fusion between CT and MRI can also be tuned using a fusion hyperparameter allowing physicians to create the most useful image. Stage of Research Applications include Treatment planning for radiation therapy, Hybrid image guided interventions (e.g., radiation therapy or surgery), Effectively fuse different modality images: low-dose CT and fast MRI reconstruction. Advantages of the device are Higher image quality for improved diagnostics and image guidance: hybrid images preserve high bone contrast and clear soft tissue dynamic range, Creation of MRI image from CT sensory data, and vice vera., Reduced human intervention in regularization term design."

Influenza remains a serious threat to public health. H5 avian influenza strains are among the most concerning despite lack of documented human to human transmission due to their high mortality rates (40-60%). Currently available vaccines are unlikely to confer significant immunity to H5. Additionally, a large portion of public health resources every year are expended to create a seasonal vaccine for influenza viral strains that are circulating in the general population. Taken together, these facts point towards the urgent unmet need for a universal influenza vaccine. Stage of Development Research - in vivo Stage of Research The inventors have created novel vaccine candidates for H5 influenza viruses. Specifically, the immune response to these vaccine candidates is directed towards specific epitopes that are conserved across strains and are less mutable than epitopes that are traditionally exposed. A modified H5 HA antigen is presented in a defined orientation via electrostatic interactions with the adjuvant such that specific epitopes are exposed and the immune response is therefore directed towards those exposed epitopes. This in turn will confer immunity to a larger breadth of viral variants. Experiments in mice with these vaccine candidates have shown that these vaccine candidates generate broad immunity to a number of influenza strains. Applications include Vaccine candidates for H5 avian influeza, Vaccine candidates for a breadth of influenza viruses. Advantages of the device are Generates broad immunity to a number of influenza viral strains via exposure of a conserved epitope."
Selective sensitization of cancer cells to elimination by cytotoxic lymphocytes                                                                                           ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/selective-sensitization-cancer-cells-elimination-cytotoxic-lymphocytes                   ,"Researchers at Stanford University have developed a novel method for the treatment and prevention of cancer. The immune system is an integral part of the human body's response to outside threats, including cancer. Specifically, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells have been shown to selectively seek and eliminate cancer cells. However, cancer cells have evolved several ways to evade this immune response, including downregulating receptors, altering tumor associated antigens, and changing the tumor microenvironment. High throughput genetic knockdown and knockout screens have been highly effective in identifying key genetic drivers of these mechanisms. However, these screens are most likely to identify factors that are necessary but not sufficient for a response. A need exists for new methods in identifying and isolating novel regulators of the cancer immune interface. Stage of Research The inventors have developed a method by which cancer cells are able to be specifically sensitized to enhance their elimination by cytotoxic lymphocytes.

Musculoskeletal disease incidence rates have increased in recent years in response to an aging population. Available therapies for osteoporosis-related bone loss are effective but come with significant side effects. As such, there is a need for novel therapeutic approaches with minimal side effects profiles. In a separate vein, stem cell technologies represent a new frontier in modern medicine. Indeed, human skeletal stem cell (hSSC) dysfunction has been implicated in musculoskeletal diseases, specifically in the context of aging. There remains a major unmet medical need for therapies targeting the re-activation of dysfunctional hSSCs in the context of musculoskeletal diseases. Stage of Development Research - in vivo Stage of Research The inventors have pioneered a novel method for re-activating dysfunctional hSSCs in the context of disease or age related dysfuntion. These researchers found that aged SSCs have lower bone-forming potential due to their a lack of diversity via their skewed lineage trajectory towards fibrostromal tissues. Using a Boolean mathematics approach, they identified two factors that can re-instate youthful SSC activity in dysfunctional diseased or aged SSCs. Specifically, this method involves contacting stem cells with a combination of an inhibitor of bone morphogenic protein (BMP)/transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B) and an activator of Hedgehog (Hh) signalling. Indeed, co-administration of such factors was shown to increase osteogenesis in mice. Applications include Regeneration of bone due to aging and or disease. Advantages of the device are Has the potential to offer a more limited side effect profile than currently available therapies, Can be delivered using biodegradable hydrogels."

Opioids are a powerful tool for pain management when used in clinical care settings. However, in recent years these drugs have been misappropriated for recreational use, spurring a public health crisis. In the US alone there were over 80,000 deaths due to opioid overdose in 2022. Naloxone has proven to be a key tool in the fight against opioid overdose by acting as an agonist of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). However, use of naloxone for opioid overdose has drawbacks, including that naloxone requires larger, repeated doses in response to more potent fentanyl. To this end, a need exists for novel negative allosteric modulators of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) that are selective with limited off target effects. Stage of Development Research - in vitro Stage of Research Researchers sought to improve upon their previous finding (compound 368) via structure-based optimization in order to find compounds with enhanced medicinal chemistry properties. Specifically, researchers modified a potentially labile sulfide to an ether to improve its pharmacokinetic properties.  Researchers found that this compound is an allosteric modulator of the MOR in vitro. While this molecule is still a full inhibitor of the MOR, it has a dampened ability to enhance naloxone affinity for the receptor, which in turn makes the molecule less dependent on co-administration with naloxone for activity. Applications include Novel treatment of opioid overdose. Advantages of the device are Potentially less dependent on co-administration with naloxone for therapeutic effects."

Managing cancer-promoted atherosclerosis through gene regulation                                                                                                          ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/managing-cancer-promoted-atherosclerosis-through-gene-regulation                         ,"Stanford researchers have discovered that tumors increase the risk of atherosclerosis by regulating expression of a specific gene that stimulates angiogenesis and intraplaque neovessel formation. Previous studies have shown that cancer patients have a significantly higher risk of developing atherosclerosis than those without cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this increased risk have not yet been identified. Understanding the cancer processes that influence atherosclerosis is crucial for developing therapies to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disorders in cancer patients and survivors. Researchers from the Leeper Lab at Stanford University have identified a specific gene in aortic endothelial cells that is responsible for tumor-promoted atherosclerosis. By comparing mRNA expression levels in the aortic arches of mice with and without tumors, they found that this gene is upregulated in the presence of tumors. The tumor-promoted upregulation was also confirmed in cultured human aortic endothelial cells. The increased expression of this gene triggers angiogenesis and intraplaque neovessel formation, contributing to heightened atherogenesis and plaque vulnerability. An effective dose of an agent that inhibits this gene could stabilize, prevent, or reduce atherosclerotic plaque formation in cancer patients. Stage of Development In vivo animal data, in vitro human cell data Applications include RNA silencing products, Neutralizing antibodies, Gene modification products.

Created via precise stacking or 'relative twist' of van der Waals (vdW) layers, moiré superlattices exhibit unpredicted and unexpected emergent electronics states, including superconductivity, making them attractive for a wide range of applications such as quantum devices, sensors, superconductors, ferroelectric memory, spintronic devices, and metamaterials.  The most common preparation method (tear-and-stack of Scotch tape exfoliated monolayers) is inefficient, unreproducible, and suffers twist angle inhomogeneity, interfacial contamination, micrometer sizes, and a tendency to untwist at elevated temperatures. The Fang Liu Group fabrication method (see Figure 1) produces moiré superlattices from a wide range of 2D materials with unprecedented uniformity and versatility, achieving much higher throughput and near-unity yield over centimeter-scale macroscopic areas, representing a significant improvement compared to conventional techniques.  The target twist angle in homo twisted moiré structures can be precisely controlled (either manually or through automated processes), due to the perfect lattice alignment of the exfoliated monolayer within the original van der Waals layered crystal. Furthermore, the macroscopic dimension enhances thermal stability of the small twist angle structures, preventing untwisting under high-temperature processes that are essential for device fabrications. Stage of development - Prototype  Figure 1 Quantum moiré interfaces manufacturing method (Image courtesy the Fang Liu Group) (a) Clean gold surface templated-stripped from a plasma-cleaned silicon substrate.

CRISPR/Cas9 systems have gained momentum in the past decade as a fast, cheap and relatively targeted approach to genome editing. Adeno-associated viral vectors are commonly used to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 due to their efficiency, safety, lower immunogenicity and non-integrative features (i.e. AAV does not integrate into the host genome reducing the likelihood of Cas9 off-target effects). Despite these benefits, one of AAV's shortcomings is its relatively low packaging capacity of 4.7 kb which makes AAV's difficult to use for larger/bulkier cargo. To overcome this packaging limitation, Stanford researchers developed a delivery construct that increases the packaging capacity of recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors. The improvement creates new therapeutic delivery avenues for genetic diseases that have previously fallen outside of the packaging limitation of AAV's such as hemophilia A, cystic fibrosis, duchenne muscular dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, Stargardt Disease, Usher Syndrome 1B, Miyoshi myopathy and more. The advancement also creates opportunities for current CRISPR-based technologies to incorporate the method to improve existing delivery mechanisms. Stage of Development In vitro data Applications include Genetic editing of larger genes for gene therapy, Cell engineering in research & industrial applications (i.e. generating cell lines that require the integration of large DNA sequences).

Use of an antimicrobial cationic biopolymer for UTI and sepsis prevention in kidney stone surgery                                                                         ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/use-antimicrobial-cationic-biopolymer-uti-and-sepsis-prevention-kidney-stone-surgery     ,"Stanford scientists have discovered that treating colonized kidney stones with a cationic biopolymer effectively disrupts bacterial biofilms and reduces bacterial burden while remaining biocompatible with kidney tissue. Irrigating the kidney with this cationic biopolymer during surgery could serve as a novel method to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and sepsis in kidney stone procedures. Kidney stones are an increasingly prevalent urological disorder, often causing significant pain and requiring surgical intervention. Pathogenic bacteria are present in up to 40% of stones and can form biofilms which protect them from antibiotic treatments. As a result, stone surgeries can inadvertently disperse bacterial biofilms across the urinary tract and cause up to 30% of patients to develop a UTI and 15% to develop sepsis. Despite these known complications, little effort has been made to address this clinical issue. The standard clinical practice involves urine tests for infection followed by antibiotic treatment if the culture is positive. However, urine culture positivity rates are low compared to pelvic and stone culture positivity rates and intravenous antimicrobial therapies do not lower the risk of postoperative UTIs. Therefore, a new method of UTI and sepsis prevention during kidney stone procedures is needed. A cationic biopolymer has been demonstrated to interact with negatively charged bacterial surfaces, disrupting their membranes and inducing cell death through the leakage of intracellular components. Furthermore, the biopolymer disrupts bacterial biofilms, thereby reducing their resilience to antibiotic treatments. And, in the urinary tract, the biopolymer interacts with the urothelium, inducing exfoliation that expels and facilitates the eradication of highly resistant intracellular bacterial reservoirs. Treatment of colonized patient kidney stones with the biopolymer resulted in a greater than 90% bacterial viability decrease after 90 minutes. Importantly, histological analysis of human urothelium did not show any abnormalities or cytotoxic effects after treatment with the biopolymer. Therefore, the inclusion of this cationic biopolymer in saline irrigation methods during kidney surgeries can be an impactful preventative measure to decrease UTIs and sepsis in kidney stone patients. Stage of Development: Preclinical – in-vivo Continued research – Large animal studies Applications include Antimicrobial irrigation during kidney stone surgery, Antimicrobial irrigation during endourological procedures, Prevention of UTI and sepsis. Advantages of the device are Currently, there are no known intravesical therapies that have broad range antimicrobial and exfoliative effects., Improves antimicrobial treatment independently of bacterial strain, biofilm biomass intensity and antibiotic resistance pattern., Biocompatible with human urinary tract tissue."

They found that inhibition of PTER, a key enzyme that regulates N-acetyltaurine metabolism, leads to N-acetyltaurine accumulation and a reduction in food intake. Therefore, the use of PTER inhibitors may be an effective way of treating obesity and other metabolic disorders. N-acetyltaurine is an abundant endogenous metabolite whose levels are dynamically regulated by diverse physiologic perturbations that increase taurine and/or acetate flux, including endurance exercise, alcohol consumption, and nutritional taurine supplementation. Interestingly, taurine supplementation has been reported to reduce mitochondrial redox stress, enhance exercise performance, and suppress body weight. PTER, an orphan body mass index-associated enzyme, was shown to have N-acetyltransferase/hydrolase activity and be capable of converting taurine to N-acetyltaurine. Genetic ablation of PTER and/or pharmacological administration of N-acetyltaurine in mice resulted in suppressed body weight and adiposity. Iterative screening for and optimization of PTER inhibitors resulted in the discovery of small molecule inhibitors with a > 250-fold selectivity for PTER. Importantly, treatment with the lead compound caused an increase of N-acetyltaurine in mice and an acute decrease in food intake. Consequently, PTER inhibitors can potentially be used as a method of treatment for obesity and other cardiometabolic disorders. Stage of Development: Research: in vivo Applications include Treatment of obesity and other metabolic disorders, Energy balance and body weight control, PTER inhibitors can be administered as a therapeutic. Advantages of the device are Novel inhibitors of energy balance linked to taurine metabolism, PTER activity can be inhibited as a method of increasing N-acteyltaurine levels to treat obesity."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, with an alarming annual incidence of about 16,000 cases and poor survival rate. Current treatment modalities, including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and even cutting-edge immunotherapies, have failed to provide substantial improvements in patient outcomes. Despite the therapeutic promise shown by immunotherapies in rodent models, their translation to human patients has faced significant hurdles. Moreover, existing treatments often target the immune cells themselves but fail to address the core mechanisms driving GBM proliferation and resistance. There is an urgent need for improved or alternative treatments that target the root cause of GBM. To address this need, Stanford researchers have developed Miro1 Reducer, a small molecule targeting a mitochondrial protein to treat GBM. Mitochondria are crucial for cellular homeostasis and the tumor microenvironment, supporting tumor growth and evasion. Cancerous and adjacent immune cells exhibit metabolic changes including the transfer of mitochondria from non-cancerous to cancer cells, facilitating tumor proliferation. Miro1 Reducer addresses this by targeting the mitochondrial protein Miro1, which is key in these processes. By reducing Miro1 expression in GBM cells, this small molecule hinders metabolic adaptations and immune evasion strategies. In a pilot study, Miro1 Reducer has shown remarkable efficacy in the rescue of tumor size and improving survival in GBM mouse models potentially by suppressing mitochondrial DNA-dependent immune activation, preventing mitochondrial transfer, and promoting mitophagy.

Targeting these epitopes for vaccine development could lead to effective vaccines for TB. TB is a significant global health problem that has been worsening in recent years with 1.6 million deaths in 2021. Despite the high mortality caused by TB, many individuals that test positive for TB have no symptoms and do not spread the bacteria to others. These patients have a latent TB infection and their immune system were able to successfully control the TB infection. Additionally, some patients have had significant exposure to TB and are not only asymptomatic but also test negative for a TB infection. This suggests that these individuals remain uninfected or rapidly clear their infection early on following exposure. The adaptive immune systems of these patients have likely targeted a TB epitope which is highly effective and ideal antigen candidates for vaccine design. A TB epitope that is recognized by CD4 T cells in patients that are naturally resistant to TB has been identified. Importantly, an improved antigen discovery library is expected to identify additional targets which could be highly relevant for TB vaccine design.

By repurposing FDA-approved drugs, this novel approach offers a practical and timely intervention for treating Alzheimer's and related tauopathies. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global health crisis, marked by the buildup of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) primarily composed of tau protein. A critical factor in AD progression is the propagation of tau protein, which drives the spread of disease pathology throughout the brain, leading to neuronal damage and accelerated cognitive decline. Current therapeutic approaches mainly target amyloid plaques, another hallmark of AD, but have shown limited success. This has resulted in a significant gap in effective treatments that can halt or reverse the progression of AD, underscoring the urgent need for new therapeutic strategies. The propagation of tau protein presents an untapped opportunity for developing novel interventions. Our invention addresses this unmet need by targeting tau protein propagation, offering a novel and previously unexplored therapeutic pathway. Stanford researchers have delved into the mechanisms underlying tau propagation and identified specific sequences responsible for this activity. Leveraging this knowledge has enabled the screening of a range of bio-reagents, which identified candidates capable of inhibiting tau propagation. Several of these bio-reagents are FDA-approved drugs, which opens the door to drug repurposing, a strategy that can significantly expedite the development and approval process.

A Novel Method for Detecting Lytic Human Herpesvirus 6 in T cell Therapies to Identify Patients at Risk of Encephalitis and Enable Safety Screening of T cell Products    ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/novel-method-detecting-lytic-human-herpesvirus-6-t-cell-therapies-identify-patients-risk ,"Stanford scientists have developed a method to detect reactivated human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) in T cell therapies using genomics technologies, including single-cell sequencing. Detecting lytic herpesvirus 6 in T cell therapies can identify patients at risk of encephalitis and assist in ensuring the safety of T cell products. Cell therapies have yielded durable clinical benefits for patients with cancer but have been accompanied by unexpected side effects. For instance, approximately 1 in 40-100 patients who undergo CAR T cell therapy suffer from HHV-6 encephalitis. Unexpectedly, the source of the lytic HHV-6 virus can come from the cell therapy itself. Therefore, the detection of lytic HHV-6 in T cell therapies can serve as a diagnostic tool to identify patients at risk of encephalitis and as a safety screening method for T cell products. Using single-cell sequencing, a rare polyclonal population of HHV-6 'super-expressors' (~1 in 360-10,000 cells) that possess high viral transcription and lytic activity late in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell culture were identified in vitro. Further, through the reanalysis of single-cell sequencing data from FDA-approved cell therapy products, the presence of CAR+, HHV-6+  super-expressor T cells were detected in vivo. Together, this implicates the T cell therapy as a potential source of lytic HHV-6 reported in multiple clinical trials and has broad implications for the design, screening, and diagnosis of unexpected toxicities in cell therapies. Stage of Development: Preclinical – in-vivo data Applications include Identification of patients likely to develop HHV-6 encephalitis who receive T cell therapies, Safety screening autologous and allogenic CAR T cells for HHV6 virus in vitro for HHV-6 via genomics technologies, Screening of patient samples to detect HHV6  in cells, including the cell therapies, in vivo.

Development of Novel Polyacrylamides for Use as Broad-spectrum Antibiotics                                                                                                ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/development-novel-polyacrylamides-use-broad-spectrum-antibiotics                         ,"Stanford scientists have developed novel polyacrylamide-based copolymers that exhibit antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria through a membrane disruption mechanism. This approach of using polyacrylamides to selectively disrupt bacterial membranes as a killing mechanism is able to circumvent known antimicrobial resistance pathways. Consequently, this technology could play a significant role in addressing the growing antibiotic resistance crisis. Antimicrobial resistance is a critical global health threat, with antibiotic-resistant pathogens projected to cause over ten million annual deaths by 2050. Despite this crisis, the development of new antibiotic classes has stagnated while resistant bacteria rapidly emerge. Common resistance mechanisms include drug uptake inhibition, drug target modification, and enhanced drug efflux. Broad-spectrum antibiotics that disrupt bacterial membranes are an attractive solution that could potentially bypass these mechanisms, but existing compounds face challenges in synthesis, scalability, toxicity, and/or stability. Polyacrylamides offer promise in addressing these issues, with inexpensive scalable synthesis and high chemical stability enabling potential global distribution without cold chain requirements. The synthesized polyacrylamide compounds demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative (E. coli and K. pneumoniae) and Gram-positive (S. aureus and E. faecium) bacteria, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) approaching clinically relevant levels. Importantly, these polymers exhibit selectivity in killing bacteria over lysing red blood cells, with a 50% hemolytic concentration (HC50) more than twenty times higher than their MICs. They exhibit antimicrobial activity through a membrane-disruption mechanism that is able to delay or prevent the development of resistance in E. coli over 15 passages. They also improve the potency of existing antibiotics and prevent or delay the development of resistance to existing antibiotics when delivered in a combination therapy. The broad-spectrum activity of these polyacrylamides, combined with their membrane-disrupting mechanism, indicates effectiveness against bacterial infections while circumventing common resistance mechanisms. This demonstrates the potential of these compounds to replace or rehabilitate existing antibiotics.

Use of recombinant osteopontin (SPP1) protein for prevention of foreign body response                                                                                     ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/use-recombinant-osteopontin-spp1-protein-prevention-foreign-body-response                ,"Researchers at Stanford University have found that recombinant osteopontin (SPP1) protein reduces foreign body response (FBR) and thereby facilitates successful integration and function of implantable devices. FBR is an immune response in which detected foreign material is encapsulated in dense fibrotic scar tissue. While this response is crucial for protecting the body from bioactive foreign substances, it can be a problem when implants are intentionally placed in the body for treatment. FBR against these implants can lead to complications such as malfunction, infection, soft tissue disfigurement, and pain. Acellular dermal matrix (ADM) has been used as a coating on implants to effectively attenuate FBR, despite an incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Given that ADM is expensive and not easily scalable, it is important to identify alternatives by uncovering its mechanisms of action. Stanford researchers have discovered that SPP1, upregulated by ADM, is necessary and sufficient for FBR attenuation. When a recombinant-SPP1-loaded hydrogel was placed adjacent to an implant, the fibrotic capsule was thinner compared to the conventional FBR. Additionally, the connective tissue architecture within the fibrotic encapsulation was comparable to that derived from ADM-coated implants. Directly managing FBR's main underlying driver SPP-1 could lead to significant improvements in biocompatibility of implantable devices.

Differentiable Beamforming: Dynamic Optimization of Ultrasound Imaging Parameters for Enhanced Image Quality and Diagnostic Accuracy                                      ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/differentiable-beamforming-dynamic-optimization-ultrasound-imaging-parameters-enhanced   ,"Stanford researchers have developed a novel approach to ultrasound imaging using the differentiable beamforming pipeline, which optimizes critical imaging parameters, significantly enhancing image quality and diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound imaging is a well-established diagnostic tool in medicine, due to its non-invasive imaging capabilities. While the performance of ultrasound imaging relies on the accuracy of the imaging parameters, these parameters are often empirically determined and remain fixed for a given imaging device. This reliance on fixed parameters can result in images of poor quality in situations where the initial assumptions fail and might not accurately reflect the underlying biological structures. This limitation hinders achieving high-quality imaging necessary for an accurate diagnosis. To address this need, Stanford researchers have developed a novel approach to ultrasound imaging using the differentiable formulation of the beamforming pipeline which adjusts parameters based on the specific imaging context. The software allows the system to learn and continuously optimize parameters during the imaging process, ensuring that the settings are always aligned with the current imaging environment. This approach differs from the static parameters used in traditional ultrasound imaging which is set for a given imaging device. Stanford researchers have demonstrated the efficacy of this technology in optimizing sound speed and element position for flexible arrays which are critical for accurate ultrasound imaging, resulting in more reliable imaging parameter estimates. By leveraging the differentiable formulation of the beamforming pipeline, our invention offers an innovative solution through optimization of imaging parameters, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy and driving the future of ultrasound imaging technology.

Ex vivo gene therapy is a powerful approach, which involves genetically modifying human cells outside the body using CRISPR-Cas9 technology and then reintroducing them into the patient for treatment of genetic disorders and cancers. Genetic modifications using CRISPR-Cas9 occurs by creating double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in DNA, repaired by either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR). HDR is more precise but less consistent across different genomic loci due to the inconsistency in the levels of HDR activity, often leading to repairs by error-prone NHEJ pathway resulting in suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Though DNA-PK inhibitors have been used to improve HDR efficiency, results are inconsistent across different human cell types. There is an urgent need for innovative solutions that enhance HDR efficiency in different genomic loci and cell types. To address this need, Stanford researchers have developed AZD7648, a novel potent DNA-PK inhibitor to enhance the HDR efficiency in CRISPR-Cas9 based gene editing across different genomic loci. By inhibiting the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a key component of NHEJ repair pathway, AZD7648 shifts the DNA repair mechanism towards the HDR pathway, allowing for more precise gene modifications. Stanford researchers have demonstrated that AZD7648 treatment outperforms other DNA-PK inhibitors, achieving up to 100% targeting frequency for small nucleotide changes and 80% for large sequence integrations in multiple human primary cell types. This invention enhances HDR gene targeting efficiency and poised to significantly improve the efficacy of ex vivo gene therapies for treating various genetic diseases and cancers. Stage of Development: Research - in vitro. The next steps involve in vivo validation of the gene-edited human cells generated with the AZD7648 treatment. Future studies include safety studies using multiple cell types and genomic loci to assess commercial viability.

Therefore, Drp1 has proven difficult to drug on account of its important role in maintaining normal mitochondrial physiology. Inventors from Stanford's Mochly-Rosen lab have identified a small molecule that targets a druggable site on the Drp1 protein, specifically blocking a its interaction with a partner protein that mediates its pathological responses- retaining normal function of Drp1 while blocking its pathological activity. The small molecule replicates the previously characterized activity of peptide P110, but without the inherent limitations of a peptide drug. P110 is not orally bioavailable, has a limited penetration to the brain and has a short halflife in vivo, thus limiting its translational potential.  The small molecule mimicking the activity of P110 is expected to overcome these pharmacokinetic barriers. In a mouse model of sepsis, the small molecule increased survival in animals challenged with LPS with nanomolar potency, while also improving symptom scores. Applications include Small molecule therapeutic for the treatment of:, Neurodegeneration, Sepsis, Myocardial infarction. Advantages of the device are New chemical entity and associated chemical space, Improved pharmacokinetics over existing Drp1 inhibitor, invented by the same laboratory, Improved selectivity to pathological Drp1 functions only, Binding mechanism retains baseline activity levels of Drp1."
Detection and prevention of unintended CRISPR/AAV-mediated concatemeric knockins                                                                                          ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/detection-and-prevention-unintended-crispraav-mediated-concatemeric-knockins             ,"Stanford researchers have discovered using a novel assay that a large proportion of CRISPR/AAV modified cells contain hidden concatemeric knockins that affect gene expression, and therefore developed a strategy to reduce their occurrence. The combination of AAV with CRISPR/Cas9 has proven to be a highly efficient strategy for site-specific genome editing.  Typically, Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) is electroporated into cells and induces a double-stranded break at a target site in the genome, while AAV delivers single-stranded DNA repair templates into the nucleus. The cell then employs endogenous DNA repair machinery to fix the Cas9-induced break using the AAV-delivered DNA as a template. This strategy has been used to make both small changes and large insertions in the genome, enabling both cures for genetic disorders as well as immune cell engineering for the treatment of cancers and autoimmune disorders. However, Stanford researchers recently discovered that a large proportion of cells (~50% or more) edited in this way contain target-site concatemeric knockins of the AAV genome. Critically, these concatemeric knockins greatly affect the level of gene expression but cannot be readily detected by commonly used assays. Researchers therefore developed novel strategies to detect these knockins as well as an approach to greatly decrease their occurrence. Stage of Development Preclinical: Researchers demonstrated a protocol to detect concatemeric knockins and reduce their occurrence by ~10-fold. Applications include Improved AAV/Cas9 mediated precision gene insertions, Treatment of genetic disorders, including sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, and epidermolysis bullosa, Ex vivo cell engineering, including CAR-T, Detection of concatemeric viral vector insertions and other complex genotypes, Prevention of concatemeric viral vector insertions. Advantages of the device are No existing methods to detect and reduce concatemeric knockins, Protocol requires minimal modification to existing gene editing pipelines."

The current production standard for fertilizer, the Haber-Bosch process, accounts for 2% of total global energy, requires high pressure and high temperature situations, and contributes 1% to carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. In contrast, this new process stirs humidified air, suspended polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or silica particles, and nitrogen gas to produce ammonia at room temperature. This less specialized technique does not use toxic chemical precursors, substantially reduces carbon dioxide emissions, and requires less energy than is consumed in the Haber-Bosch process.

Humans live in concert with thousands of different bacteria throughout our bodies. These bacteria help digest our food, protect us from infection, and regulate our immune system. Accordingly, alterations in the human microbiome are associated with diseases ranging from diabetes to cardiovascular disease, and therapeutics that alter the microbiome represent a promising approach to treating a wide range of disorders. However, deciphering the roles of bacterial strains in disease has remained a major challenge, due to the large number of unique bacteria that compose the microbiome and their variability from individual to individual.

Cold Gas Stream Method for CryoEM Sample Grid Vitrification                                                                                                               ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/cold-gas-stream-method-cryoem-sample-grid-vitrification                                  ,"Stanford researchers have developed an innovative technology for cryo-vitrification using a temperature-controlled cold gas stream instead of traditional liquid cryogen, which prevents grid distortion, enabling gentle sample cooling and continuous imaging throughout the vitrification process. Traditional cryo-vitrification methods which involve a plunge freezing or blot-less deposition or spraying liquid cryogen on cryoEM grids for vitrification encounter numerous challenges, from grid distortion and damage, imaging limitations, complex sample handling, equipment dependencies and constraints on time-resolved experiments. There is an urgent need for a solution that addresses these challenges for cryoEM sample preparation. Stanford researchers have developed a technology which addresses these issues by simplifying the vitrification process. Instead of submerging samples in liquid cryogen, this innovation uses a novel approach which exposes the sample and cryoEM grid to a temperature-controlled cold-gas stream delivered via a cryo-nozzle, which eliminates grid distortion and allows continuous imaging before, during, and after vitrification. Prior to vitrification, the gas stream is blocked to prevent premature cooling. Upon activation, the cold gas rapidly cools the sample grid, ensuring efficient vitrification. Since the sample and cryoEM grid do not move during the vitrification process and not submerged in a cryogen, the grids can be continuously imaged using an optical microscope and exposed to various triggers for time-resolved measurements during and after vitrification. Additionally, the sample-grid can safely remain in the cold gas stream for other operations and removed using a specialized cryo-tong (also part of this invention) and saved for cryoEM imaging. In summary, this innovation overcomes the limitations of traditional cryo-vitrification methods, offering a comprehensive solution for advanced sample preparation in cryoEM research.

BRINP3-derived peptides – A Breakthrough in Obesity Treatment                                                                                                             ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/brinp3-derived-peptides-breakthrough-obesity-treatment                                   ,"Stanford researchers have discovered BRP3, a novel peptide derived from the BRINP3 protein, which effectively reduces food intake and body fat in mice, while preserving muscle mass, thus offering a novel, safe and effective solution to treat obesity. Obesity is a major global health concern expected to affect over 25% of the global population by 2035. It shortens life expectancy by 5-10 years and increases the risk of death from diabetes, heart disease, and other related conditions. Current weight loss methods, including caloric restriction and existing weight loss drugs, often lead to muscle mass reduction, compromising overall health and physical function. Combination therapies have been explored, but no current treatment prevents muscle loss while promoting weight loss. Effective drugs that can reverse obesity without causing significant side effects, including loss of muscle mass, remain an unmet need. To address this, Stanford researchers have discovered a novel peptide (BRP3) derived from the human BRINP3 protein that reverses obesity without causing muscle loss. BRP3 is a peptide cleaved from the parent protein BRINP3 and detected in human plasma. When administered to diet-induced obese mice, the peptide BRP3 reduced food intake within 30 minutes of a single injection, with effects lasting up to 3 hours. Subsequent studies showed that daily administration of BRP3 in diet-induced obese mice led to significant weight loss by 10% and improved glucose tolerance, with weight loss attributed to a reduction in subcutaneous and visceral fat mass, without changes in skeletal or heart muscle mass. In summary, this invention introduces BRP3, a BRINP3 peptide, which combats obesity by suppressing food intake and body fat without affecting muscle mass, showcasing its therapeutic potential as a safe and promising anti-obesity treatment.

Thus, strategies to target Tr1 cell differentiation in vivo and generate purified Tr1 cell products in vitro can provide therapeutic benefit in wide variety of human diseases. Inventors at Stanford developed a method targeting master regulator transcription factors of Tr1 cells to increase the efficacy of their differentiation and manipulate their functions. Master regulators are key transcription factors that regulate cell lineage identity, differentiation and functions. They showed that the transcription factors IRF4 and BATF are necessary for Tr1 differentiation, and that the activation of transcription factor MAF potentiates Tr1 cell differentiation. Using CRISPRa, the inventors than developed a method that allows the manipulation of Tr1 cell induction, which will enable the manipulation of endogenous or adoptively transferred Tr1 cells in vivo. The ability to genetically engineer Tr1 cells can lead to better treatments for graft-versus-host disease, rejection of solid organ transplants, severe autoimmunity and allergy. Applications include Treatments for immune mediated diseases and diseases driven by Tr1 dysregulation such as certain cancers and infections., Discovery and drug development to increase IRF4, BATF, and MAF expression in vivo, potentiating the function of Tr1 cells in vivo., In vitro differentiation of Tr1 cells by genetic engineering of CD4+ cells leading to expression of IRF4, BATF, and MAF., In vivo prevention of Tr1 cell differentiation by targeted degradation of IRF4, BATF, and MAF in CD4+ T cells..

Once this early window has been missed, the 5-year survival rate precipitously drops below 50%. Due to the current lack of effective screening modalities targeting early ovarian carcinomas, only ~15% are detected during the early stage--these lucky few cases are usually detected incidentally, during an imaging procedure carried out for unrelated reasons. If a rapid, cheap, easily accessible screening modality for early ovarian cancer were to be created, patient outcomes would drastically improve. Dr. Blankenberg and colleagues at Stanford invented a detection method using exosomes - small vesicles that are prolifically shed into the blood by tumor cells with molecular characteristics of their parent cells.

The Mahajan Laboratory at Stanford used tissue culture in vitro to identify a minimal DNA promotor to drive gene expression in the NPCECs.  The method has shown that a BEST2 minimal promoter (specific to NPCECs gene expression) can be manipulated and linked to a sequence of gene encoding of interest in the NPCECs to treat eye disease.  Primarily, NPCECs are linked to glaucoma which affects 60 million people worldwide with no cure.  Current management involves delaying the progression of disease, but many people continue to lose eyesight (due to retinal ganglion cell loss) permanently even with proper therapies.

Instead of waiting days or weeks for laboratory results to determine microbial content, use of biomarkers to identify the etiology of uveitis is faster, more accurate, and more reliable.  Particularly in ocular inflammatory cases, waiting for the correct diagnosis and treatment (50% of cases are idiopathic) can cause visual impairment, and ultimately blindness due to the recurrent and chronic nature of the disease process.

For instance, some assays include incubating permeabilized cells with enzymes, where the nuclear envelope retains the chromatin structure and interacting biomolecules. However, this precludes anucleated cells, such as bacteria, or in cells undergoing cell division. In addition, substantial wash and centrifugation steps can introduce unwanted variability and produce negative impacts on chromatin quality that can hamper downstream analysis. Therefore, there is a need in the art for improved methods for sample preparation for chromatin mapping with lower starting material, minimal handling steps, and a non-reliance on the nuclear membrane. Stage of Research The inventors have developed a single vessel (i.e. a ""one-pot"") method for preparing samples for genome wide mapping of protein-DNA interactions.

Current TMD fabrication methods rely on exfoliating small flakes from a bulk TMD crystal, which does not produce full, mass production friendly, multi-layer films. The Pop Lab deposited wafer-scale, multilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) films by selenizing pre-deposited, pre-patterned tungsten with solid source selenium and H2Se precursors (See Fig. 1). These WSe2 films yield a charge carrier lifetime of up to 144 ns, corresponding to power conversion efficiency of ~22% and specific power of ~64 W g-1 in a packaged solar cell, and ~3 W g-1 in a fully packaged solar module.  Initial focus was WSe2, but the method could be applied to sulfur (instead of selenium), and other transition metals or even other transition metal oxides (e.g. WSe2, WS2, MoSe2, MoS2). This breakthrough could pave the way for mass-production of low cost, high-efficiency, lightweight, flexible, multilayer WSe2 (and other TMD) solar cells that are capable of irregular shapes like a drone wing, car roof, or wearable devices.

Available protein-based enzyme replacement therapies are not curative, require frequent infusions, and often become less effective over time. Similarly, emerging strategies that use a viral vector to deliver a functional copy of the defective gene to the liver are limited by pre-existing neutralizing antibodies, potentially life-threatening immune responses, and a decline in enzyme production over time. Researchers therefore developed a new strategy in which red blood cells are turned into enzyme-producing factories, taking advantage of the fact that red blood cells are produced in large numbers and circulate throughout the body. To achieve red blood cell specific gene expression, researchers use ex vivo CRISPR/Cas editing of hematopoietic stem cells to insert a functional copy of the enzyme behind a promoter (HBA1 or HBA2) that is only active in red blood cells. Scientists further optimized this strategy for the treatment of hemophilia B, caused by mutations in factor IX. They increased the amount of factor IX secreted into the bloodstream by over 3-fold and engineered the protein to be 3.3-fold more active.

However, the materials currently used to 3D print MAPs have limited printing resolution, are often too soft for complete insertion into the skin, and lose biocompatibility with wear. To overcome these limitations, Stanford researchers used a pyrolytic polymer to manufacture MAPs. They 3D printed the desired micro-array structure using a soft pyrolytic polymer. The printed structure was then subjected to pyrolysis, a thermal decomposition process, to form a miniaturized replica made of hard monolithic carbon. These steps ensured both high-resolution structural details and enhanced mechanical strength and stability, facilitating skin insertion and drug release. Additionally, high electrical conductivity of these MAPs enabled their use in electrochemical sensing.

Timothy Syndrome is a severe developmental disorder that causes long QT syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, syndactyly and immune dysfunction. While scientists have discovered the genetic basis for the disorder in many patients (mutations in exon 8A of the calcium channel CACNA1C), there are no available treatments that act on this root cause. Researchers therefore developed a treatment strategy to modulate the splicing of CACNA1C. Using human cortical spheroids derived from patient cells, they screened a series of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to identify one that biases pre-mRNA splicing to include the healthy exon 8 instead of the mutated exon 8A. Scientists showed that this candidate could restore calcium defects in patient-derived cortical neurons, influence interneuron migration, and restore activity-dependent dendritic retraction in transplanted cortical organoids. This ASO therefore has significant promise for the treatment of Timothy syndrome. Stage of Development In vitro: selectively causes mutagenic exon 8A exclusion in patient-derived cortical organoids, restores calcium defects in patient-derived cortical neurons, influences interneuron migration, restores activity-dependent dendritic retraction in transplanted cortical organoids. Applications include Treatment of Timothy syndrome type 1, ASO development for other CNS disorders using a multi-level patient-derived organoids and assembloids.

To prevent toxicity from hyperactivity, the activation state of these receptors can be regulated by a drug that acts on proteases. While chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy effectively treats liquid cancers, further improvements in persistence and potency are needed to combat solid cancers clinically. Regulating cytokine-triggered intracellular signaling cascades related to growth and proliferation could help augment CAR-T cell activity, enhancing anti-tumor efficacy. To achieve this, Stanford researchers developed chimeric cytokine receptor (CCR) systems capable of constitutive signaling in the absence of their cognate cytokines. Their CCR system is comprised of two subunits, each including a heterologous dimerization domain and a cytokine receptor intracellular signaling domain (ICD). Because a cognate for the first dimerization domain is selected as the second dimerization domain and the two domains are in proximity, therapeutic cells with these CCRs have active intracellular signaling associated with persistence and potency downstream. The signaling cascade can be interrupted by regulating protease activity on ICDs to avoid exceeding the therapeutic window and causing toxicity. Cells with these CCRs could demonstrate sufficient anti-tumor activity to fight solid tumors. Stage of Development In vivo data Applications include Immunotherapy for cancer, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and more:  CAR-T therapy TCR therapy CAR NK cell therapy  , CAR-T therapy, TCR therapy, CAR NK cell therapy.

Single-cell genomics technologies have proven critical for understanding cellular diversity and function, enabling precise mapping of genetic and transcriptomic information at the level of individual cells. While single-cell genomics can identify cell types based on marker transcripts, there are no methods for isolating these populations for further downstream analysis. This is a particular challenge for studying rare cell types, including many involved in disease. Stanford researchers therefore developed a scalable assay that enables single-cell RNA sequencing profiles from complex subcellular mixtures defined by the presence or absence of RNA transcripts. This new strategy integrates single-molecule nucleic acid imaging (e.g., smFISH) with single-cell sequencing. Researchers were able to enrich and study rare cell populations from immune populations as well as fixed brain tissue. Overall, this innovative approach not only expands the applicability of single-cell genomics but also enhances our ability to explore cellular heterogeneity in greater detail, providing a powerful tool for both basic research and clinical applications.

Diagnosis of celiac disease is determined by presence of transglutaminase 2 (TG2) autoantibody and histology of intestinal biopsies. However, those seeking diagnosis often already maintain a gluten-free diet prior to gastroenterology consultation and therefore test negative for autoantibody and present normal duodenal mucosa. So, it is necessary to have patients receive a gluten-rich diet for weeks to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Celiac patients will thus experience symptoms including diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain. Air-liquid interface (ALI) organoids enable culturing epithelium and stroma to recapitulate the human small intestine, and patient-derived organoids can be used for suspected celiac patient diagnosis instead. ALI organoids could be used whether the individual is on a gluten-free diet or gluten-rich diet. Specifically, ALI organoids will be challenged with gliadin and examined for gliadin presentation, immune cell expansion and activation, and epithelial cell death. It could also be used to screen the potency of drug candidates by evaluating the reduction of gliadin-dependent immune cell activation or expansion and epithelial cell death.

Conventional vaccines are designed to produce antigen-specific antibodies or cytotoxic T cell responses against specific pathogens. However, some inadvertently invoke heterologous immunity against non-targeted antigens. This can be leveraged to design pathogen-agnostic universal vaccines. Recent studies suggest that both immunological memory in the adaptive immune system and trained immunity of innate immune system are involved. However, further investigation is needed to identify specific mechanisms to modulate to induce nonspecific immunity. Stanford researchers have found that the interaction between the adaptive and innate immune systems and non-hematopoietic cells in tissues is key to antigen-agnostic protective immunity. Based on their previous finding that BCG vaccine induces heterologous immunity via CD4 T-cell derived IFN-gamma, which imprints an antiviral state on the innate immune system and epithelial cells, they developed a vaccine containing antigen ovalbumin and GLA/3M-052 adjuvants, which elicit IFN-gamma responses. In vaccinated mice, antigen-stimulated T cells imprinted prolonged and broad innate-mediated antiviral resistance in myeloid and epithelial cells, protecting mice against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses, unrelated to the administered antigen.

Combining modulation of factors downstream of this degenerative pathway with chemotherapy represents a promising strategy to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy without compromising tumor growth inhibition. 40%-60% of patients treated with anticancer drugs develop chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). CIPN symptoms, such as tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, difficulty walking, and other challenges with daily activities, significantly deteriorate the quality of life and commonly develop into persistent, chronic neuropathic pain. As a result, the healthcare costs associated with CIPN are substantial, with treatment expenses for patients suffering from CIPN exceeding those for patients without the condition by $15,000 (in 2006 dollars). With the number of cancer survivors projected to top 20 million by 2030, preventing CIPN is both a pressing and a growing healthcare challenge. Activating the neuronal degenerative pathway through overexpression and treatment with a chemotherapy drug in C. elegans impairs touch sensation which recapitulates symptoms if CIPN seen in patients. Importantly, in mice, knockout animals that genetically lack the downstream factors are less sensitive to chemotherapy than their wild-type littermates suggesting inhibition of this pathway may be preventative of CPIN. Importantly, targeting downstream factors makes it unlikely that tumor growth inhibition will be compromised during chemotherapy. Consequently, a combination treatment strategy can potentially prevent or minimize chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in oncology patients.

A significant number of marginal organs are recovered but are not transplanted due to concerns of poor quality, suboptimal function, and limited regenerative capacity. What is critically needed to address this organ shortage are methods that allow for marginal organ rehabilitation, thus enabling them to be successfully transplanted without compromising patient outcomes. There are two features of the proposed technology. The first is a perfusion device that mimics heart function, an oxygenator that mimics lung function, and a dialysis system that mimics kidney function. The second feature is the use of a novel perfusate additive, liposome-packaged human WNT protein (L-WNT). WNTs are potent stem cell activators that activate endogenous stem cells and enhance cell viability, thereby improving engraftment efficiency. The unique perfusion device loosens the narrow time constraints for transplantation, thereby allowing in-depth organ evaluation and clinical intervention. The use of L-WNT raises the possibility of functional liver reconditioning.

The uSMAART (ultra-Sensitive Measurement of Aggregated Activity in Restricted cell-Types) technology enables the study of small dynamic variation of one or more biological process in the healthy and pathological brain from animal undergoing ecologically relevant behavior. More Details: Fiber photometry, a measurement technique that aggregates fluorescence signal using a fiber optic, is a highly pervasive approach in the field of systems neuroscience to study in vivo brain tissue dynamics during ecologically relevant behavior. Despite its common usage by researchers and companies alike, none of the state-of-the art fiber photometry device is capable of detecting small and fast signal changes in a low-light regime in freely behaving animals. Current technologies are benchmarked against cytosolic calcium indicators whose dynamic ranges far exceed that of the instrument and biological noises. Therefore, when used outside of this original configuration, i.e. with other fluorescent indicators (voltage, neuromodulator sensors…) with much weaker dynamic ranges, these instruments do not protect against unwanted noise sources which can lead to biological confounds, especially when the instrumental noise correlates with the animal motion. Inventors at Stanford have developed a novel fiber-optic technology that achieve ~10 fold greater sensitivity than prior fiber photometry systems and is immune to optical artefacts induced by animal motions. The uSMAART (ultra-Sensitive Measurement of Aggregated Activity in Restricted cell-Types) technology tracks signals from up to 2 reporters from up to 2 different brain regions concurrently, with high sensitivity. The uSMAART system outperforms similar fiber photometry implementations in at least one of the three following aspects: (1) stability of illumination source, (2) immunity to fiber motion-induced illumination artefacts, and (3) detection sensitivity in the visible range. The novel technology offers a low-cost, flexible, and highly sensitive tool to decipher the precise temporal relationship of multiple physiological processes from multiple brain regions simultaneously. Stage of Development: Research – in vivo – working prototype and proof-of-concept in mice Applications include Neuroscience research, Medical Diagnostics and Treatment Monitoring, Pharmaceutical Development, Drug discovery platform, Analytic chemistry. Advantages of the device are Can be used in freely moving animals, Measurements are immune to instrumental and biological artefacts., High bandwidth, high sensitivity detection of biological parameter dynamics, Simultaneous dual biological parameters with identical performance, such as quadruple processes recordings from two brain regions (two per region) with identical performance, Experimental flexibility to combine multiple fluorescence sensors and monitor signals from multiple, deep brain areas., Universally applicable to any fluorescent reporters, from genetically encoded fluorescent proteins to synthetic dyes and nanoparticles.."
Strategy and technological implementations for concurrent fluorescence measurements of multiple biological parameters in behaving animals                                 ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/strategy-and-technological-implementations-concurrent-fluorescence-measurements-multiple ,"Inventors at Stanford have developed a novel strategy to perform concurrent fluorescence measurements of multiple biological parameters in freely moving and head-restrained animals. As more genetically encoded fluorescent indicators (GEFI) are being developed to monitor, in living animals, a wide range of biological phenomenon (e.g. transmembrane voltage, ions, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, opioids, pH…), optical approaches that capture the precise temporal relationship of many physiological processes simultaneously in awake animals become critically necessary. Unlike our invention, none of the existing technologies offers the experimental flexibility to combine multiple fluorescence sensors and monitor those signals. Two of the most common optical tools in neuroscience to study in vivo brain tissue dynamics during ecologically relevant behavior are fiber photometry and mesoscopic imaging. Fiber photometry is a measurement technique that aggregates fluorescence signal using a fiber optic. While it captures signal at the tip of the fiber, mesoscope imaging will instead capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of the fluorescence signal in awake, head-fixed animals. Recent studies have used both techniques to optically sense voltage, calcium, or neuromodulator dynamics in a variety mouse behavior. However, none of the state-of-the art fiber photometry devices or 1-photon epifluorescence mesoscope systems are capable of imaging more than 1 biological parameter at once while precisely referencing biological noises. Indeed, until now, there has not been a suitable method to account for various biological artifacts while imaging 2 spectrally orthogonal fluorescent proteins that capture two independent biological parameters. Therefore, while multiplexing fluorescent signals gain more appeal in the field, molecular strategy and technological implementations to achieve this with high sensitivity and low cost is needed. Here, we introduce a new molecular strategy and offer two technological implementations for fiber photometry and mesoscope imaging. While the former relies on a lock-in amplification technique, the latter relies on precise control over the illumination activation and imaging frame acquisition. Our simple molecular solution can be used with any fiber photometry systems (used in freely behaving animals) or 1-photon epifluorescence wide-field imaging techniques (used in head-fixed animals) to probe the dynamics of multiple molecular phenomena concurrently in awake animals. This strategy is universally applicable to any fluorescent reporters, from genetically encoded fluorescent proteins to synthetic dyes and nanoparticles. This strategy will reduce by 50% the cost of instrumentations used for fluorescence multiplexing of dynamic processes. Stage of Development: Research – in vivo – working prototype and proof-of-concept in mice Applications include Neuroscience research, Medical Diagnostics and Treatment Monitoring, Pharmaceutical Development, Drug discovery platform, Analytic chemistry. Advantages of the device are A cost-effective method to multiplex fluorescence signals., Simultaneous dual biological parameters with identical performance, in freely and head-restrained behaving mouse., Safeguarding against instrumental and/or biological artefacts., Universally applicable to any fluorescent reporters, from genetically encoded fluorescent proteins to synthetic dyes and nanoparticles.."
Functionally biased ligands for the Complement 5a Receptor                                                                                                                ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/functionally-biased-ligands-complement-5a-receptor                                       ,"Stanford scientists have discovered multiple functionally biased ligands that can selectively activate distinct subsets of signaling pathways downstream of the complement 5a receptor. These ligands will be useful for the scientific study of complement 5a receptor signaling and, more importantly, can potentially be used as therapeutics. The complement 5a receptor (C5aR) is an important cellular receptor that exerts many critical physiological functions, including regulating the immune response and promoting cancer resistance to treatments. It has been shown that C5aR can simultaneously activate many downstream signaling pathways; however, the biological consequences of individual pathways are unclear. The biggest obstacle in the understanding of C5aR signaling is the lack of pharmacological tools to selectively modulate subsets of the signaling pathways and allow the analysis of their biological functions in isolation. There are two major signaling pathways downstream of C5aR: cAMP and beta-arrestin. Various mutants have been discovered: 1) those that completely abolish beta-arrestin signaling, 2) those that partially inhibit the cAMP pathway 3) those that inhibit both beta-arrestin and cAMP pathways. The short-term application of these ligands would be their use as research tools to dissect the signaling pathways downstream of C5aR. In the long term, with a better understanding of the physiological functions of the ligands, they could be used as therapeutics to treat diseases that require the selective activation of the related signaling pathways. Stage of Development: Preclinical – in-vitro data Continued research – elucidation of the exact biological function of the ligands Applications include Use as research tools to dissect C5aR signaling, Therapeutics for diseases that benefit from the selective activation of C5aR. Advantages of the device are Selectively activate a subset of C5aR signaling pathways as opposed to complete blockage, Use of peptides leads to much stronger binding affinity."

Fabrication with durable materials is essential for manufacturing of many composite structures, such a vehicles, airplanes and satellites. Traditionally, these have been fabricated using aluminum due to its durability, but composite laminates would provide a lighter, more cost-effective solution. Despite this, composite laminates, have been difficult to apply due to their complex, non-homogenized nature. Now, the Tsai lab at Stanford has proposed a novel double-double laminate design to overcome the challenges of traditional composites. This design enables perfect homogenization, eliminating shear- and stretch-bend coupling. Consequently, it improves upon metals by offering lighter weight, higher stiffness, and better possibilities for tapering. As a result, the double-double laminate solves problems of complexity and sub-optimal outputs associated with previous composites.

T1D is an autoimmune disease in which insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed by the patient's own immune system. The resulting insulin deficiency is most often managed through exogenous insulin administration. This requires frequent or constant blood glucose level monitoring and insulin administration, significantly diminishing the patient's quality of life. Many studies have suggested transplantation of macroencapsulated islet beta cells as a means to achieve insulin independence. The encapsulation can provide a robust barrier against the host immune system. However, it could also impede insulin diffusion from the encapsulation, making it difficult to release insulin at physiological levels. Stanford researchers have discovered that applying pressure to the macroencapsulation could enhance insulin transport kinetics. A modest pressure equivalent to normal diastolic blood pressure sufficiently improved insulin flux across encapsulating membranes. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that pressure-driven flow is superior to relying solely on diffusion. Transplantation of the pressurized macroencapsulation of beta islets could help T1D patients achieve full insulin independence.  Figure Caption: Pressure-driven dosing from macroencapsulated islets supporting physiologic insulin dosing in mice Applications include Cadaveric, donor, or stem cell-derived beta islet transplantation, Artificial pancreas, In vivo cell-based bioelectronics.

Researchers at Stanford have optimized a genome editing method in HSPCs using CRISPR/Cas9 in combination with AAV6-medicated homologous recombination (HR). The Cas9 nuclease and a short guide RNA (sgRNA) were delivered to the target genomic sequence. The double-stranded DNA break made by Cas9 was repaired by HR with a designed donor DNA template in the AAV6 vector that contains the desired genetic modification. Using this new method, researchers were able to achieve highly efficient editing, where both single nucleotide and several kilobases of DNA can be changed.

Emphysema is a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease characterized by irreversible damage to the lung's air sacs. Severe emphysema can be treated with lung volume reduction surgery, which involves resection of the affected areas. However, many patients are not candidates for this invasive procedure. An existing less invasive treatment option, bronchoscopic endobronchial valve placement, is often ineffective due to collateral ventilation through damaged airways. To develop an alternative, Stanford researchers have repurposed stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, commonly used to treat acute lung cancer. Irradiation can noninvasively induce scarring in the treated lung tissue, resulting in volume reduction. Through a phase I clinical trial in severe emphysema patients, optimal strategies for radiation dose distribution and patient selection were determined. Stereotactic irradiation for lung volume reduction (SILVR) has the potential to become a noninvasive and efficacious treatment option for patients with severe emphysema.

Genome editing technologies have revolutionized the field of personalized medicine. Despite its initial promise, many of these methods have failed to deliver useful clinical therapeutics. Two commonly used methods, AAV and nanoparticles, lack flexibility in their cellular specificity programming to be widely used in tissue or cell specific diseases. Engineered cells have emerged as promising delivery vehicles, but current engineering methods lack specific and programmable macromolecule delivery. Cells have evolved several methods of direct molecule exchange that have cell type specificity, including trogocytosis. Trogocytosis is favorable because it has been shown to be bidirectional, and it maintains the functional integrity of the transported molecules. However, engineered macromolecule delivery methods have yet to capitalize on this method of cell-to-cell transport. Stage of Development Research - in vivo Stage of Research The inventors have created a novel cell engineering strategy (TRANSFER) for the delivery of macromolecules in a cell specific fashion. More specifically, the inventors have harnessed the power of trogocytosis to deliver macromolecules from an engineered cell to another cell in vivo, allowing for targeted delivery while maintaining the functional integrity of the macromolecules being transported. The macromolecules can subsequently be freed from endosomes in recipient cells and optionally functionalized in a trogocytosis-like pH-responsive membrane fusion. This method is fully programmable and allows for tissue and cell specific targeting as well as the delivery of many different macromolecules.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed for sequence-agnostic sequencing and has revolutionized every area of biomedical science. One application of NGS is assaying the nucleic acid binding or modifying for a single protein interacting with thousands to millions of sequences simultaneously. However, increasing the number of proteins assayed has been difficult, costly, and labor-intensive. In another vein, microfluidics platforms have allowed for the parallel assessment of binding affinities of a several sequences with hundreds of transcription factors (TFs). Microfluidic technology has not yet been leveraged to assay the binding of many TFs to many sequences in parallel. Stage of Development Research - in vivo Stage of Research The inventors have developed a novel approach to assay many sequences and many proteins binding affinity at the same time. Specifically, they use a barcode and print approach that links particular members of pooled sequenced libraries to specific protein variants that interact with the particular library members. Briefly, a barcoded library of sequences and a library of proteins that are imprinted at discrete locations to provide a barcode of sorts for the protein variant are created and pooled. These libraries are then put through a microfluidic device separately such that each microfluidic droplet contains one protein variant and one sequence. These are then incubated with a capture agent that binds to variant proteins and the captured sequences bound to the variant proteins are sequenced.

Blocking the immune signal can be applied in various contexts, such as treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), diabetic nephropathy, and metabolic syndrome among other metabolic diseases. Obesity is a global issue and commonly associated with conditions such as liver dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. The lack of effective therapeutics, coupled with a predicted 57% of the world population having an obesity-related condition by 2030, necessitates the development of novel treatment options. Blocking the immune receptor signal in a fatty liver disease mouse model led to a ~28% decrease in weight and complete removal of abdominal fat over 10 weeks in treated mice     relative to control mice. Additionally, a verified biomarker in the form of a risk allele is available which can be used to quickly and reliably determine if patients are likely to benefit from the treatment. Consequently, blocking agents for the immune receptor have the potential to enhance and complement current treatment options for obesity, such as weight management and GLP-1 agonists, and serve as a broadly useful treatment strategy for patients suffering from obesity-related conditions. Applications include Treatment of obesity-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and hyperglycemia, Treatment of chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the liver and other organs, Combined treatment with current available options such as weight management and GLP-1 agonists.

Quantitative AML patient risk assessment using RNA signatures associated with sensitivity and resistance to immune cell killing                                           ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/quantitative-aml-patient-risk-assessment-using-rna-signatures-associated-sensitivity-and ,"Stanford researchers have discovered RNA signatures that can be used to predict patient outcomes and identify optimal treatments in acute myeloid leukemia. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common leukemia in adults, with over 20,000 new cases a year in the US and a five-year overall survival rate of only 27%. While reliable methods for predicting patient outcomes in AML could aid clinical decision making by e.g. predicting which patients would benefit from more aggressive treatment, AML risk is currently evaluated by a complex combination of factors including age, patient performance status, cytogenetics, and medical history. This method is unreliable particularly for the 30% of patients that lack genetic abnormalities associated with clinical outcomes. To address this, Stanford researchers discovered transcriptional programs in AML that are associated with either improved or worse patient outcomes. Researchers treated AML patient cells with human immune cells, identifying subsets of AML cells that are either sensitive or resistant to immune cell killing. Immune-resistant AML cells were found to express RNA transcripts associated with poor survival rates in a large database of AML patient transcriptomes. Better and poorer patient outcomes could be predicted from the expression of RNAs associated with sensitivity and resistance to immune cell killing. Stage of Development Proof of concept: AML patient cells that are resistant to immune cell killing in vitro express transcripts associated with poorer patient outcomes, while patient cells that are sensitive to immune cell killing express transcripts associated with improved outcomes. Applications include Molecular diagnostic tests for AML patient risk stratification, Pre-clinical research in AML. Advantages of the device are More quantitative and reliable than current methods for patient risk assessment in AML, Easy to implement using established workflows for RNA sequencing or qPCR, Can be performed non-invasively from a peripheral blood sample or from diagnostic bone marrow aspirate (already used to diagnose AML)."
Efficient generation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-like cells from human pluripotent stem cells: a platform to create blood and immune cells                           ,https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/efficient-generation-hematopoietic-stem-cell-hsc-cells-human-pluripotent-stem-cells      ,"Researchers at Stanford have created a method to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into >90% pure hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-like cells, which serve as progenitors to blood and immune cells. To create any type of human blood or immune cells in vitro, hPSCs must first be differentiated into HSC-like cells. Previous differentiation methods yielded heterogeneous cell populations, with HSC-like cells constituting only a small fraction. Also, the resulting HSC-like cells displayed limited expression of key HSC transcription factors. Stanford researchers devised a system to differentiate hPSCs into >90% pure HSC-like cells that express transcription factors at levels comparable to human HSCs, by involving a transition through an artery intermediate. The resulting hPSC-derived HSC-like cells can be differentiated into a range of blood and immune cell-types, including myeloid cells, erythroid cells, T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. Replacing diseased blood or immune cells with these engineered cells is a promising treatment approach for many different diseases, including cancers, autoimmune disorders, and genetic diseases. Furthermore, adding new functionalities to these cells could allow for more targeted treatment options. Stage of Development Continuing to optimize in vitro differentiation of hPSCs into HSC-like cells. Applications include Cancers:  Leukemia Lymphoma  , Leukemia, Lymphoma, Autoimmune disorders:  Type I diabetes Multiple sclerosis  , Type I diabetes, Multiple sclerosis, Genetic diseases:  Sickle cell anemia Inborn immunodeficiencies  , Sickle cell anemia, Inborn immunodeficiencies, Blood transfusions, Disease modeling. Advantages of the device are >90% pure populations of HSC-like cells capable of upregulating HSC signature transcription factors as opposed to ~3.5% in previous literature.."
